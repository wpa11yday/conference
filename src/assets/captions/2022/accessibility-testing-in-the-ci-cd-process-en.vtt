WEBVTT

00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:30.140
[pause]

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.480
Kim Coleman:
Welcome back everybody.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.730
I'm Kim Coleman.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.410
I'll be your host for the next three
hours here at WP Accessibility Day.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.990
I've been in the WordPress
community for over 15 years,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.250
and when I'm not supporting community
events like this, I'm working

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.160
on my membership plugin
Paid Memberships Pro.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.250
I'm excited to announce our next
session Accessibility Testing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.670
in the CI/CD process
with Maciek Palmowski.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.390
Maciek spends his days at Kinsta
as a development advocate analyst.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.500
After hours,
he spends most of his time trying

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.310
to find interesting news for the
WP Owls newsletter or cycling.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.050
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.720
in the chat area, and we'll answer
them at the end of this session.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.560
You can also use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.190
That's it for me.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.650
We welcome Maciek to the stream.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.890
Maciek Palmowski: Hi, Kim.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.260
First of all, Kim, big thanks for
pronouncing my name so nicely.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.880
I know it's not easy
so kudos for you.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.760
Before I start, I want to
start with a small anecdote,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.970
because when I submitted my talk for
WP Accessibility Day I was so sure

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.560
I submitted for the Lightning Talk.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.740
I was surprised that of
course, I made a mistake.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.930
I can say that this will be the
Accessibility testing as a part

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.350
of CI/CD process the
extended version.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.300
Let's talk about
how to automate.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.510
As Kim mentioned,
my name is Maciek Palmowski.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.090
I work at Kinsta as a DevAdv,
but at heart, I am a developer.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.790
I always have been a developer.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.560
This I think brings a bit different
perspective for me especially

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.540
in this accessibility space, because
I won't lie accessibility wasn't

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.140
a thing that I was interested in
for quite a while but it changed.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.300
It changed at some point.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.620
First of all,
there were two reasons that caused

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.270
that I got interested
in accessibility.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.350
First of all, I'm a cyclist and
I don't know if you've ever been

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.100
in Poland but the infrastructure
there isn't the best.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.590
On and on, I had to either
carry my bike or move

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.090
from one place to another
in quite a weird manner.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.360
In short, it wasn't something easy.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
I started to understand
that okay I am a cyclist.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.260
It's not a big problem for me
but for some people it might be.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.750
Also, I became a parent.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.640
Again together with my
wife, we don't have a car.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.235
We mostly use either
public transportation

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:39.610
or we are using our bicycles
or going on foot.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.840
Thanks to using a
stroller, we understand

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.900
how some disabled people have to feel
using the whole city infrastructure.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.090
It's a horrible experience and
it really, really opened my eyes,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.630
because I understood that
while at some point our kid

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.820
will stop using this stroller,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.470
we won't have to go around
with it all the time,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.640
but we never know what
will happen tomorrow.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.050
Maybe some of us will get
into an accident or something

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.800
and we'll be disabled for the rest
of our lives, and we will have

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.720
to live in this infrastructure.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.950
This was really true
eye-opener for me.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.980
That it's really worth
investing in accessibility

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.040
because you never know
what tomorrow will be.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.870
This was the reason why I
got interested in the topic.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.510
First, I want to tell a bit about
how accessibility testing looks

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.790
from a developer's perspective.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.820
The sad news is especially at
those places I had a chance

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.660
to work with, suddenly it doesn't.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:18.150
It's just like that because
for most agencies accessibility

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.720
is a separate task that is
in most cases left on the end

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160
of the whole process.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.370
Also, many companies still
don't fully understand

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.190
who should be responsible for
it, who should take care of it.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.370
For some reason, I saw that many
companies like to push it only

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.050
on developers,
and they still don't understand

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.360
this very important argument that
accessibility is provided by everyone

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.550
on the team.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.910
Every part of the team has to
add something from the design,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.700
through developers,
through the content team,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.540
because accessibility is something
more than just a few lines of code

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.770
or an overlay like some
companies try to convince us.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.320
Also quite often there
is this sad argument

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.920
that we have more
important things to do.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920
I'm very happy that
at least I see that

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.610
in Poland there is this change
that every public site has

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.470
to go through these WPCAG norms.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.100
This was the first time where
many companies start understanding

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.370
that accessibility is a must because
without it they won't get the money.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.640
While this is a bit forcing
those agency to get interested

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.910
in accessibility,
it works so it's good.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.570
The constant problem of
the lack of education.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.130
Developers has to learn
all of their life.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.050
There are so many new
technologies, so many new things

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.530
that appear every day.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.720
I can understand why some of them
just don't have the resources,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.470
the time to continue
education in another field.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.570
Again that's why everyone
on the team should take care

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.850
of accessibility thanks
to this like a hive.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.331
Such an agency or company
should learn accessibility

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.740
just step by step.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.230
From my perspective I see
that sometimes it's enough

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:51.290
to understand the problem, just not
to pretend that it doesn't exist,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.510
just to try to know that it's
there and it'll already be easier

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.030
to continue with
your own education.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.280
I mentioned this weird term in the
title, CI/CD, what does it mean?

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.580
CI/CD is nothing else than continuous
integration/continuous deployment

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.580
or development.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.940
It's not a tool it's a
methodology of how we work.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:26.120
While it can be a bit
complicated at some point,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.480
the whole idea behind
this is very simple.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.410
It's all about constant testing.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:37.170
Every time we create a
change in our code base,

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.190
we are running all the
tests that we have.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.060
A typical developer would say okay
so we'll be running unit tests,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.560
functional tests, end-to-end tests
from different sites from PHP

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560
from JavaScript.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.820
Why not to add one more
test to the equation?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.730
Maybe let's add
accessibility as one of them

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.980
because well a test is a test,
so there is no difference.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.090
Of course, it's also responsible
for the build and deploy process,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.250
and it's also very important
that without passing the test

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:17.150
we never will deploy our application
or our website to production.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.120
Which would mean that if we
would add accessibility testing

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:32.750
as a part of this CI/CD,
if we will encounter an error

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.300
from the accessibility point of
view, we won't push it to production,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.830
because it's an error and we
shouldn't push pages with bugs.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.590
What are the problems?

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.240
First of all, no one is using it.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.440
At my previous company because
before Kinsta, I worked at Buddy

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.660
which develops a CI/CD
platform and I was responsible

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.150
for trying to get people from
the workspace a bit more popular

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.990
about deployment automation.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:13.200
I learned that it's not so
popular, especially that workers

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.270
are pushing more and more towards
this no-code local approach.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.810
Although the big companies,
the big agencies are using CI/CD.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.400
Yes, it's here it's not as
popular as it should be.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.640
Also, many agencies
and companies will say

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.670
that we have more
important things to do,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:42.590
which is a weird argument
because I would make it,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.490
we have more important things
to do than waste our time

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:52.500
on repeating manual actions,
but it's their choice, their money.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.760
The last very popular argument,
we don't have time which results

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.740
to we don't have time to automate
our tests, but we will have a lot

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.810
of time to fix everything
on production very short.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.870
How we can add accessibility testing
to a pipeline is very simple.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.300
Thanks to CLI tools like
axe-cli, Pa11y accessibility,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:26.530
or Google Lighthouse we can test
our website just by installing this

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.750
and passing few arguments.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.190
Mostly the URL of the website we want
to test and some configuration file.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.510
That's it, it's that simple.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.440
This is how a pipeline can look
like a true enormous pipeline.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.260
You see,
we are running all the tests.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.590
We are running PHP Stan,
PHP Unit, integration test,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.340
deploying to staging server.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.280
Then we are running the XCLI then
we are running some other tests.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.110
What's important, if any of
those tests at some point fails,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:03.630
we will never reach the last steps
so transfer files to production.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.230
If there is an error somewhere,
it will never reach the production.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:19.520
It's very important, and this is an
example how an X can return error

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.180
if it'll find one.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.950
I was testing dequeuniversity.com
and we can see

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.816
that there was a violation
of duplicate ID active

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:31.830
with one occurrences.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.830
That's it.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.040
We have a bug, we know where
to find it, and we know

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.090
that the action failed.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.770
If we would be developing the site,
it wouldn't ever reach the production

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.800
until we fix it.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.690
This is on what we argued.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.240
What are the biggest pros of
automating accessibility testing?

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.120
First of all, the problem
is I cannot find this tweet,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.630
but I remember that the queue,
so the company behind X responded

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.870
on Twitter to me and they
mentioned that we can find

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.480
about 60% issues that way.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:10.930
That's great.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:16.920
That's the majority of issues
there, there are so amazing.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.240
On the other hand, the testing
will always, always happen

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.040
in the background.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.240
Every time we will push our
change, the tests will run.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.480
There is no way that
we can prevent it.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.370
On the other hand,
we can just push our thing

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.810
and start doing something else,
the tests still will happen.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.590
Also, it's a great way to
get a very quick response,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.750
whether the app is
good to go or not.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.480
Of course, let's remember in the
60% of issue that it'll find.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:56.350
I would consider that, CIC that this
automatic testing can provide us

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.990
with let's call it a
good enough approach.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.960
If it passes, it's good enough,
although we still should take care

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960
of the rest.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.400
For me, I think this is
the most important thing

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.200
about this automated testing.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.780
It can be a true eye-opener
for many developers

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.080
because like I mentioned,
this testing will happen

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.680
whether the developer
wants it or not.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.480
If at some point such
a developer will see

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.050
that this website has like 100
errors, that's not something good.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:45.070
After the initial frustration
yes, there is 100 bugs.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.550
We can create tasks, we can start
fixing it, and while fixing them,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.550
we can learn.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:00.570
If someone didn't ever care about
accessibility seeing this log full

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:08.320
of errors might open some
eyes and change the approach

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.790
towards accessibility.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:19.190
Of course, this automatic
testing is not a silver bullet.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.590
We can only find
60% issues that way.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.520
There are still 40% issues
left, so this means

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.470
that now we won't
automate everything.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:37.970
We still have to hire people that
know how to deal with accessibility.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:46.760
Also, those checks only happen when
we push a code change, only then.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.110
If we are developing something,
we are developing it in the dark.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.820
That's why it's also
important to use other tools.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.990
I will mention them in a moment.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.360
It's also important to explain
why we added those tests

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.830
because I mentioned there
is a huge possibility

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.880
that if you will run it for
the first time, your website

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.931
might not be too accessible,

00:16:16.932 --> 00:16:23.470
especially if you never
set a priority on it.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.860
When you get a return of
100 potential errors to fix,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.410
you might get a bit frustrated.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.140
You might get mad.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.880
This is why it's important
to tell why we are doing it,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.980
why accessibility is important.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.450
Yes, this is the role of
the agency of the company.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.940
Like I mentioned,
there are also browser tools

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.910
and probably most of
you are using them.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.050
Just a quick example
of how axe works.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.400
Probably most of you use it
every day, but just to make sure,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.890
we are just testing
the wordpress.org website

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.250
and after a few seconds
after pressing the button

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:20.400
to scan our site we will get
the list of all the issues,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.880
we see their descriptions,
where they are located, what to do

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.250
to solve them.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.250
Beautiful.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.970
What is the difference between
those browser tools versus CI/CD?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.040
First of all, browser tools
are much faster to work with

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.120
because like I mentioned
with CI/CD tools, we have

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.300
to push a code change to our Git
Repository and then it'll run

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.500
in the background,
and then we'll get the response.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.750
While with browser tools,
we just press the button

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.090
and we already have the response.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:01.540
They are also easier to use because
you just have to install an addon

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.930
to your browser.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.830
It's like one or two
clicks and you're done.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:15.093
While to run a CI/CD pipeline
in general you require

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.900
a bit more knowledge,
so it's much harder to do.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.510
Like on the other hand you don't
have to remember about CI/CD tests

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.580
because they will be the
part of the testing suite.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.800
They will always happen.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.240
That's what's important.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.840
With browser testing,
you can skip it.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:38.920
It's just up to you.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.960
Will you remember
to test your website

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.740
or maybe you will
start cheating yourself

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:49.710
and just push whatever you have?

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:55.020
With CI/CD tools, it's
impossible because if it's a test

00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.960
that is a part of the pipeline,
it will always, always run.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.260
Let's compare them.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.950
I will show you what is
the difference in time

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:15.460
of running a CI/CD pipeline versus
testing a site with axe in the browser.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.580
On the left, we see a pipeline and
on the right, we see of course axe.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:38.120
As we see, we already have axe ready
and a few seconds later we got the axe

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.200
that runs in the CI/CD pipeline.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.520
It took a bit longer.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.860
I would say we would have a
chance to drink a small espresso.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.880
It depends on the website,
but the difference isn't that huge.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.530
It was an unrealistic case
because when we will be running

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.090
a CI/CD pipeline, in most
cases, we will test everything,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:11.350
not only accessibility, so the more
realistic case would look like this.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.210
On the right we still have nothing
changed, the axe is like it was,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.840
but now we are running unit
tests, functional tests,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.600
and accessibility tests.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.670
This takes a bit longer.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:32.130
As you see, we already could be
drinking coffee while waiting

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.040
for the result.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.550
Especially that some CI/CD
pipelines can take about 15 minutes,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.550
20 minutes.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:51.700
Yes, we would drink a lot of
coffee during this is waiting time.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.780
What should we use,
browser or CI/CD tools?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.870
The answer is, in IT,
in most cases we would use the term,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.270
it depends, but not this time.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.390
Both, of course.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:07.690
Both because they have a bit
different reason to exist.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.450
First of all, we have to remember
that browser tools are far superior

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.810
when it comes to the moment when
we are developing something,

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.810
we can constantly check
if our code is correct,

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.790
if we didn't make a mistake,
or something like this.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.300
CI/CD tools are perfect
so we can be sure

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.490
that the code we are pushing
to production is correct,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.070
that no one skipped something.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.610
Also, when we are using a
browser tool, in most cases,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.450
we will be concentrating only on the
place on which we are working at.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:49.250
For example, if we are fixing
something on the contact page,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.710
we'll be only testing
the contact page,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.820
but it may produce
something called regression.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:03.970
A fix that, change something
on contact created an error

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.880
on some different place of our
website, let's say on our blog

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.070
because we used something
from the contact page.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.060
Probably we will miss it
using the browser tool.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.040
Thanks to the CI/CD tool,
when we would list multiple pages

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.650
to test, we would find that
yes, we caused the regression,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:24.950
we have to fix it.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.560
Okay, so that's it.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.140
Thank you very much for having me.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:37.790
I'm really proud to be a
part of this conference and

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.260
if you would have any questions
even after the conference,

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.580
do not forget to reach me
out on Twitter or sign up

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.770
to my newsletter on newsletter.maciek...
maciekpalmowski.dev.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.520
Are there any questions?

00:22:53.973 --> 00:22:56.240
Kim: Thank you so much, Maciek.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.750
If you're watching live, you can
use the Q&A section to the right

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.670
of the video stream
to ask your questions.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.740
I have some of my own,
so until I see some coming

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.470
into the private chat, is that okay
if I just pick your brain here?

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.520
Maciek: Of course,
that's why I'm here.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.350
Kim: Awesome.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.100
For me, I've seen when we
have testing like this,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:21.990
it's kind of training our developers to see
those issues and then maybe learn

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.480
and write better
code from the start.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.810
Could you speak to how you've
seen that happen in yourself

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.060
or other developers
that you've worked with?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.560
Having CI/CD part of
the development process?

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.110
Maciek: Yes.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:39.230
This is exactly what,
because let me say this, like this.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.100
Developers are lazy.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.240
I know this from experience
because that's why I got

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:53.830
into this whole automation process
because I wanted to save my time.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.200
There are machines that can do things
for me, and the same happened here.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:05.100
Because we are lazy, we don't
like to fix the same errors over

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.990
and over and over.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:11.370
That's why we will learn how to
those basics of accessibility.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.230
In most cases, not because we
want to learn accessibility,

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.400
but because we don't want
to see this error anymore.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:27.720
It may be a quite pragmatical
approach, but the result counts.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.880
We will have an accessible
product and on the other hand,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.230
the developer won't be frustrated
because he will learn that yes,

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.280
adding this alternative text to an
image wasn't something that difficult

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:46.260
and it's like I won't get a
notice that hey, there is an error

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.290
in your code.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.420
It was that easy.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:56.250
Yes, I really see that
apart from just checking

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.220
if our application is okay,
it's also about the learning

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.960
about this eye-opening,
so it works.

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.250
Kim: Oh, that's really good.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:12.220
Another question I had relates
to creating those first tests.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.000
I know when people have no
tests written for their code,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.890
whether that's the website code or
a plugin code, or a theme code,

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.040
it can be daunting
like where to start.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.240
Do you have recommendations
for the first places to look at

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.650
for this or I may have
missed it in the beginning?

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:34.220
Are there existing libraries that
you can use that have some scans

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.490
in place?

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.070
Maciek: In most cases, and
this is also the great part about,

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.200
for example, using the axe-cli,
you don't have to write any test

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.850
because it mostly
scans your website.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.130
Of course, you can at some
point start adding your own test

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.020
and this is great but by
default, just to check

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:59.480
if the website is good
enough, just run the axe-cli.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.830
There is no additional work when
it comes to creating the test

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.110
because as you mentioned
when you have a blank slate

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.830
and at some point, someone,
tells you, "Now we are testing it."

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.630
You're like, "Oh,
god, what to do now.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.720
I don't know how to start."This
is one of those tools

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.890
when the only problem that
you'll have is in the worst case,

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.260
okay, we have 100
errors, what to do now?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.940
That's simple.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.100
You just add 100 tasks
and go step by step.

00:26:31.024 --> 00:26:34.390
Kim: Do you have recommendations
for when you run these scans

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.500
and the code is outside of your
control, if it's in a plugin

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.930
if it's in a theme, how have
you found it successful to work

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.200
with those authors?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.850
These are open-source
products often you would hope.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.630
How have you found success pushing
back or requesting the changes

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.990
that are outside of the
website's code itself?

00:26:56.081 --> 00:27:05.630
Maciek: First of all, in most
cases, I try to limit the number

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.190
of plugins because of
I'm a control freak.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.700
I always feel better
when I am in full control

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.980
because there are many cases,
and this is one of those,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.160
when it can be annoying
that for example,

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.740
you are finishing this public website
and the only problem is not you,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.740
it's the plugin.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:38.110
Of course, in most cases from,
at least from what I remember,

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:43.180
I was always able to fix everything
at least on the front end.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:50.070
The backend is always a bit
different part of the equation.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:57.550
I still think that when we talk
about accessibility at least here now

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.300
in Poland,
we only see the front end right now.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.930
We still need some time
to get about the backend.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.110
Still, it is possible.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:18.020
It's also one of the things that
differentiates a good plugin company

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.180
from a bad one.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.550
If they will just say, no,
we won't fix it's impossible.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.970
It's just accessibility.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.230
It's just a sign that,
okay, it's a bad plugin.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.740
Sorry, I don't want to use you.

00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:34.510
Kim: Yes, people should
be open to hear that feedback

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.260
and make those changes.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.410
I'm sure they aren't
often major changes.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.370
It's adding simple things to
where images are rendered,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.690
like you said, to form elements
and fixing certain things.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.180
Hopefully, it's not a
hundred for the developer.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.920
Maciek: Exactly.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:01.940
This is the thing about
accessibility is we have

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.850
to remember that it's a process.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:11.340
It's not the task
that we will finish.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.180
I lately see that
there are many things,

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.110
especially in the web
development that are a process.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.970
We are talking about performance
that is constantly changing.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.870
We are talking about the general
experience, which is also changing.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.930
The part of this experience
is, again, accessibility,

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.770
which is also a process
because everything changes.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.530
Everything changes.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:38.560
We have access to new hardware,
we learn things about something

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.090
that we never knew before.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.640
We have to constantly adapt.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.300
This is something really,
this is really fascinating.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.530
It never will get boring.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:56.230
Also, the fact of this that I
mentioned 60% of issues can be solved

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.660
in the automatic way.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.270
I remember that in some
documentation from a few years ago,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.520
we could read about 20%, 30%.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.400
This is growing, and I also can't
wait what will start happening

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:17.070
at the moment when we'll start
using AI for accessibility testing.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.195
There are many problems
with accessibility

00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:20.480
that aren't code-related.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.190
They are about logic,
about how we've written the text.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:30.120
This is something at the moment
without any AI can't check

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.530
because those are just words.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:37.002
Thanks to AI they are
starting to have meaning.

00:30:39.811 --> 00:30:42.870
Kim: You mentioned AI, do you
use GitHub Copilot in anything?

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.100
I haven't used it,
but I don't know if it's helpful

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.460
for some of these [crosstalk]

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.420
things.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:47.860
You're afraid?

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.040
Maciek: I'm afraid and
I will also be honest,

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:57.630
I don't fully trust all those big
corporations, especially that I know

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.330
that they are planning a
lawsuit against Copilot

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
about is the open-source code used
in a way that it should be used.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.490
There are many things.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:13.580
I mean AI also changed so
many things about how we--

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.720
especially for open source,
because we shared our code and now

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.350
why someone is using it,
why someone is earning money

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.040
without mentioning us.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.200
Many interesting things.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.650
Kim: Oh, for sure, for sure.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.160
I think our moderator had a
few questions, so we'll see

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.310
if they come into the
private chat here.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.860
I'm looking back at my notes.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.360
Let's talk about something
totally unrelated.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.890
You're working on
the WPL's newsletter.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.120
What got you started in that?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.254
You can just share a little,
be a little promotional

00:31:50.255 --> 00:31:51.140
and get some signups.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.010
Maciek: It started
in a quite funny way

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.160
because at some point
my wife asked me,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.410
"Hey, maybe we'll start doing
a WordPress newsletter."

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.640
I'll be honest, I wasn't listening
carefully, so I just nodded

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.290
and say, yes, and this was the
Polish edition that right now has

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.430
more than 200 issues.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.330
200 weeks ago, I just nodded
without listening, and, yes,

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.240
here we are [chuckles].

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:17.860
Kim: It's cool.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.950
I also work with my partner.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.640
I don't know how involved your
wife is in the newsletter ongoing

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.790
but it's fun to work
with your spouse, right?

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.079
Maciek: We work
at most of companies

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:32.050
for most of our lives together.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.290
Now at Atkins Studies,
this is a change

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.600
where we are working
separately, but who knows?

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600
Maybe at some point.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.470
I really love working with her.

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.730
It's something normal for me.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.880
Kim: There you go.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.630
When you haven't done it,
it feels very foreign to work

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.330
with your partner, but then when
you do, you're like, oh, this is

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.280
how we do things.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.150
We're good.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.250
Maciek: It's really great.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:07.380
It's always the person and
especially that we had a bit

00:33:08.754 --> 00:33:13.360
in our specializations
worked really great together

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.115
because she's a front-end developer

00:33:15.116 --> 00:33:19.660
and I was mostly a back-end
developer, so it was a great combo.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.500
Kim: I'll ask this question
from our moderator, Truk.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.270
Maybe it's slightly
related to accessibility,

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.950
but also your knowledge having
been in the WordPress community

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.270
for many years.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.840
Truk asks can you tell us how
students can be involved in WordPress

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.880
for school purposes?

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.570
Is there a possibility of students
working together with WordPress

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.310
without too much knowledge or any
suggestions you have about getting

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.770
into the community as a student?

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:54.420
Maciek: I think that especially
with what is happening right now,

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.450
this push toward this
low-code/no-code approach,

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.640
I think that WordPress is
more accessible to everyone.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:09.350
When I started using WordPress
let's be honest, it was most mostly

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.640
for geeks and nerds.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:18.070
I think that WordPress by default
got more accessible to everyone.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:22.505
You didn't need to have
any specialized knowledge

00:34:22.506 --> 00:34:24.190
to start building.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:30.030
The only thing that you need
is to the will to learn.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.380
I think it's very simple to start.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.760
Then the next step especially
after meeting our community,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.920
because our wordpress community
it's different, but it's different

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.040
in a good way.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:55.200
I would really recommend attending
some WordCamp to feel the whole vibe,

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.460
to take part in the Contributor Day,
because especially contributors,

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.936
they can open your
eyes to find something

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:08.890
that might interest you more
in the WordPress space.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:15.370
I remember while we were
organizing WordCamp in my City £ód,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.940
during Contributor Day, one of our
biggest problems was to explain

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.830
to people Contributor Day
is not for developers.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.550
Contributor Day is for everyone.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:30.770
You can be a translator, a designer,
and a whole long list of roles

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.490
that can be filled.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:38.010
If you have this will to learn
and you will find something

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.030
that interests you, that's it.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.730
I think that out of
all the CMSs out there,

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.790
WordPress is the most
friendly to start with.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.880
Kim: Yes, I would totally agree.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.170
I would suggest joining
the Make WordPress Slack

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.990
if you're not a member yet.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.500
There's various teams in there and
it's like virtual Contributor Day

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.570
all the time.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:06.710
There are teams I think that
have online scheduled meetups

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.670
or just chats in the Slack areas.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.160
Like Maciek said, not all
developer-focused ways to contribute

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.560
to like education, to documentation,
just to community efforts

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
in general.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.040
It can be a busy Slack
channel to be a part of.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.130
Use that Mute and only be in the
channels or have them active,

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.530
the ones that you really
like to be part of.

00:36:28.834 --> 00:36:32.124
Plugins channels are a little scary.

00:36:32.125 --> 00:36:32.665
No.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.550
Maciek: I made this mistake once
and it was like constantly pinging me

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.230
and this was okay,
mute, mute, mute.

00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:45.803
Kim: No, for sure.

00:36:45.804 --> 00:36:50.690
Maciek: Still the
best-- because like I said,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:56.870
our community it's so different that
I think that meeting those people

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.920
from the community is one of
the most important things.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:07.840
It's also a good idea for schools
to get involved with other members

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.160
to organize some show and
tell and things like this.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.660
I still remember how
much meeting Alain Schlesser

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.500
during WordCamp London meant to
me, it was,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:30.480
he is a WordPress Rockstar so
when you meet someone like this

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.359
and he helps you finding
this bug that you had,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.900
and it was like amazing.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.260
I never felt that I'm
talking to a Rockstar.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:50.030
I just felt that I just talking to a
friend that I met for the first time.

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:53.210
Kim: Through the pandemic,
there were people I would reach out

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.520
to on Twitter or in the Make
Slack and just ask for 15 minutes

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.070
of their time.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.860
I always found people really
friendly and receptive.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.070
There's still a pretty
active Meetup community also

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.860
with virtual meetups, so I guess
that's a way to meet some people

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.820
and get to know things.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.400
I think the return of in-person
WordCamps on a broader scale

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.980
will really help younger
people in this community,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.330
because you've been two years
without that face-to-face,

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.170
without feeling that energy
that we all got to feel

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.110
for all those years
leading up to the pandemic.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.970
I think it's probably been
a part of [crosstalk].

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:33.000
Maciek: WordCamp Europe
was one big hug fest.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.812
That's it.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.060
Everyone was hugging each other.

00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:47.030
Kim: Our producer here said
that WordCamp EU was amazing.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.210
More votes for that.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.220
I'm sure there'll be more to come.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.610
Maciek: I really missed it.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.440
Kim: Will you be
going to WordCamp Asia?

00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:54.980
Maciek: No.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.980
Sadly not.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.840
At least not this
year, but who knows?

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:06.470
I really hope to visit all those
flagship WordCamps at some point

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.110
because why not?

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:11.060
Kim: For sure.

00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:15.970
Maciek: Oh,
and I see one more question.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:23.410
Can you tell us a little more,
how can one protect their database

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:29.470
from your experience?

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.630
Just the regular things.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.650
Having a good hosting
because it's important

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:42.400
and using updated versions of
MariaDB not using weak codes.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.720
In general, it's simple.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.000
Sometimes feel that it's scary
when we think about security

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.070
because security is quite simple.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.240
It consists of,
many many simple things.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.940
The amount of them sometimes
causes that we make an error.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.680
We forget about something and
that can cause a bigger tragedy.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.760
Kim: Yes, I would agree with
that, and strong passwords

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.090
for your own WordPress account.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.490
Strong passwords and
most good hosts are going

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.610
to give you a strong password
if you do have access to login

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.750
into the hosting environment and
to your hosting account directly,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.360
for sure.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.260
Take backups.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.710
Your best friend is your
backups, for sure.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.610
Maciek: Exactly.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.890
Kim: Take them in places other
than your web host environment.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.890
Have backups for your backups
and put them everywhere.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.930
Maciek: What's important,
test your backups.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:51.410
I remember GitLab
once had this problem.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.340
They had backups,
but they'd never tested it,

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.180
and it turns out they
didn't have backups.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:57.700
[chuckles]

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.460
Kim: Can you restore?

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.150
That is key.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.930
That is a super key.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.320
We do have a question from Norburn.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.430
How much time does it usually take
to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.030
from scratch, which includes
the accessibility testing,

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.400
without writing the tests?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.200
Just some portion of
the pipeline setup.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:26.280
Maciek: I think that if you are
not having any experience with it,

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.831
the most basic example
that would automate

00:41:32.832 --> 00:41:35.790
all the build process deploy,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:41.020
and for example, add this
accessibility testing could take

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.450
only a few hours.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:51.300
That's it, because it also depends
on which application we will you use,

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.050
because some are a bit more
difficult to start with.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.905
For example,
GitLab CI is at least for me,

00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:59.030
it was always very complicated.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.570
On the other hand,
we have those more simple tools like

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.230
for example Buddy, for example,
I think it also deploy HQ.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:12.090
They have a visual interface,
so it's much, much, much simpler

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.900
to start with.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.400
Using those tools like
I said it should take

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.130
because at it's the beginning.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.750
It's always a bit trial and error.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.700
You have to test something.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.740
At first,
only play around with staging.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.780
Don’t risk

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.310
I am saying this is as
a person who wants

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:41.740
maybe due to the whole website
because he's done a small typo

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:46.720
in the folder name and yes.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.359
That's why you have to--

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.090
Kim: Ctrl Z, Ctrl Z.
Undo [laughs].

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.930
Oh, man.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.790
Maciek: Exactly.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:43:01.420
In general, overall, I always
try to say that when it comes

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.890
to starting with CI/CD,
go step-by-step, slowly.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.820
Start with the continuous
delivery deployment part.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.170
First, think only about
automating the deployments.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.060
That's it.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.180
Then start building, if you have
some node modules, or you want

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.210
to compress your JavaScript.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.560
This is another.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.600
At the end, start adding tests.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.390
The cool part about accessibility
testing like I mentioned,

00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:27.320
it's simple.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.810
It's just running the CLI tool.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:35.640
You can add those no or
low configuration tests

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.580
like accessibility
testing, like PHPStan.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.320
It's also quite easy,
but for developers.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.908
In the end,
you go with those most difficult

00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:49.300
where you have to write that.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.070
This whole workflow creating it,
probably can take even years,

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.610
but it doesn't matter.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.420
It's important to
just go step-by-step.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.500
Have some progress, because every
time you will add to this extra step,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.820
you will save yourself
a lot of time.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:12.020
The more project on
which you are working at,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.810
the bigger save of
time you'll see so.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:16.410
It's worth it.

00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:20.140
Kim: Have you seen in
these teams that it's like

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:26.450
an individual person's role to be
the one that addresses the errors

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.890
that come up with the
accessibility testing in the CI/CD,

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.900
or how I guess depending on team
size, it could be the person

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.480
who does everything or how
have you seen that work?

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:42.370
Maciek: The sad part
was that in most companies,

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.230
there was none and sometimes
there was this person

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.490
who knew about accessibility
and was arguing with the rest

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.750
of the team that, "Hey, there
is something like accessibility.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:58.350
Let's do it." I was constantly
arguing with the designers

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:06.120
because they never understood
why it's also their role to think

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.000
about accessibility
because we are artists.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.780
We create art.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.240
No, you're not.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.540
Websites aren't art.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.470
Websites are engineering.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:22.640
It can look nice but
still, it's engineering.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.870
It's not whatever
you want to paint.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:26.970
It's like cars.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:31.170
They may look beautiful,
but underneath, there is an engine.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.440
There is a lot of technology in.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.770
That's it.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.320
Kim: I love the
way you refer to that.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.470
That's very true, and there can be
these battles within an organization

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.280
where some people are more
of an advocate like you said,

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.270
for the accessibility route,
and other people are more protective

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.220
of their art.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.620
We all want to build functional
websites that achieve

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.440
whatever their goal is.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.550
If the goal is to just look pretty,
that's one thing, but if it has

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.290
to be usable,
it has to be usable by all of us.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.780
It's a real challenge.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:08.950
Maciek: Exactly, and like I
said, I also think that again,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.530
this is a problem with the
lack of education that--

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:20.590
because I think that still,
developers are a bit more advanced

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:25.160
when it comes to accessibility
when compared to design teams,

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.020
at least in my case.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.180
I hope that I'm mistaken.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:36.080
It's like this that for some
reason, many think

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.650
that developers are the people
responsible for fixing the website

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.490
to pass the accessibility.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.560
It even sounds horrible, because we
are not taking care of accessibility.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.080
We are taking care of fixing
things to make it pass.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.560
It's a horrible approach.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.070
The truth is that I really
think that the design team has

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.350
the biggest impact
because it's their vision.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.930
It's not only about the contrast.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.200
It's not about the colors.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.130
It's about the general idea.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:16.200
For example, if we are thinking
about using I don't know,

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.410
rich videos and everything.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.900
Okay, let's do it but also
think, what about accessibility?

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:28.220
How we will provide the same
content to people who just want

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.880
to experience the videos.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.810
This is not about
painting the website.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:40.150
It's about the general
idea that stands behind it.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:46.100
I think that the designers
don't fully understand

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.920
how enormous impact they have
on the website's accessibility.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:59.630
Kim: Truk asks, what are the
highest challenges people face

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:00.430
at the beginning?

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.450
Some of these tests.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:03.770
You mentioned the [crosstalk]

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:04.570
Maciek: The number of errors.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:05.580
Kim: ALT Text on images.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.300
Just the number.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.390
It can feel overwhelming.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:11.330
Maciek: Yes,
because if you develop the website

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:15.170
and never thought about
accessibility, and at some point,

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:20.830
you will run the test,
and I mean, quite quickly

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:23.530
after the first frustration phase

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.320
and anger phase,
because they will be there.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.770
They will be present.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:36.220
You will start just seeing that
"Okay, lack of alternative text

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.000
for images."

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.990
So you start to fixing it,
and 100 turns into 50.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.850
Now and other simple things.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:48.840
In the end, it will turn out there
are just few more difficult fixes

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.280
to fix.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.030
[laughs]

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.831
Kim: That's awesome.

00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:55.360
I think I'm going
to wrap it up now.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.780
Thank you so much
for being with us.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.820
Are there any closing
remarks that you have?

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.200
I think all of your education--
oh, they took him away.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.960
Never mind.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.350
Sorry, Maciek.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.350
[laughs]

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:04.380
Cool.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.150
Thank you for attending this
session with Maciek Palmowski.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.690

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.910
The next session is on designing
a webpage for the Institute

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:40.770
for the Blind and Visually
Impaired with Al Goldberg

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:44.650
and Anna Ingeborg
Lynette at 10:00 AM UTC.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.570

to win some great prizes.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:56.020
We're going to reset the chat, and
then there'll be a new chat available

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.940
to you for the next session.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.430
I'll see you right
here after the break.
