WEBVTT

00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:31.864
[silence]

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Kim Coleman> Welcome
back, everyone

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.180
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.870
I'm Kim Coleman and I'm excited
to announce our next session,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.840
Designing a Webpage for
the Institute for the Blind

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.960
and Visually Impaired.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.720
This is presented by Ole Guldberg
and Anna Ingeborg Linnet.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.110
Ole is an ICT specialist
working on digital accessibility

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.660
at the Institute for the
Blind and Partially Sighted.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.580
Anna is a communication and
accessibility consultant

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.723
and has worked at
the Danish Institute

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:06.410
for the Blind and Partially Sighted
or IBOS for 10 years.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.020
Like before, please feel free to
add your questions in the Q&amp;A tab

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.680
of the chat area and we'll answer
them at the end of the session.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.060
You can also use the ideas
section in that area to chat

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.740
with other attendees.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.360
Without further ado,
I'll hand you over to Ole and Anna.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:27.869
<v Ole Guldberg> Hi.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
It looks like we're through and
everybody's seeing our slides.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.290
Thanks for having us.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.010
We'll be talking about Designing
a new Webpage for the Institute

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.430
for the Blind and
Visually Impaired.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.680
First of all, we're both from
the Institute for the Brand

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.090
and Partially Sighted which is
an institution from Denmark,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160
located in Copenhagen.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.740
We're quite an old institution.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.990
We're from 1811.

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:13.837
Have about 120 employees
at the institute

00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:16.240
with more than 30 specialties.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.840
That means ICT consultants,
communications personnel,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.980
and a lot more specialties.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.000
When it comes to Denmark, we are
the local knowledge, competence,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.270
and rehabilitation centered
when it comes to vision.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.270
We're national.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.210
What we do is provide help
for citizens, public bodies,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.250
municipalities, companies,
and vision professionals out there

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.250
in Denmark.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.960
So that we can help.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.930
We know this target group
because they come to us,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.310
we have them in-house and we
know how they're compensated.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.900
We know more or less the newest
accessibility technologies and so on.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.520
We're a specialist when
it comes to how blind

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.910
and partially sighted use
accessibility technology

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.410
and how we teach them to use
accessibility technology.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.830
A bit about us.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Anna Ingeborge Linnet>
My name is Anna.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.050
I am a communications and
accessibility consultant.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.950
I've been at the institute,
I think it's almost 11 years now,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.160
and I have had many different roles,
especially with communications

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920
and accessibility.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.550
I have very much experience when
it comes to working with text

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.030
and content and design and documents
in regarding to accessibility.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.750
Communication is a big part, but
I also, part-time I work with Ole,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.470
where we teach and consult external
partners about accessibility.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.810
<v Ole> As already said,
I'm an ICT specialist.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.280
That means I usually work
on digital accessibility.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.850
Screen readers are more or less
my major area when it comes

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.560
to digital accessibility.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.880
I'm a member of the advisory
report for the Agency

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.230
for Digital Government in
Denmark, their advisory board

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.040
for web accessibility.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.540
I'm a member of the committee that
supervises how we monitor the law

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.112
when it comes to
digital accessibility

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.090
for the public body websites.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.890
I'm also a member of the Danish
Standards Committee called DS/S-437.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.030
That is a really strange
name for the committee

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.159
that actually does
standardization when it comes

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.350
to digital accessibility.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.138
That is more or less that.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Anna> I'm going to tell you a
bit about the target group we have

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.970
at IBOS.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.520
Primarily,
we have two different target groups.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.300
The one is the adults who have severe
visual impairment or blindness.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300
That could be people who are
in employment or studying,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.830
but it could also be people who
are on their way to find a job

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.330
or get into a different study.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.810
We have a student
counselor for that.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.430
It could also be a person with a
visual impairment who is not ready

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.230
for a job or education but
have other functionality issues

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.830
besides their vision.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.770
They might need
protected employment.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.610
It could be daily activities,
it could also be permanent

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.270
or temporary living.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.160
The other core group we have
are the professionals working

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.580
in the field of vision, and they
work locally all around Denmark.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.870
Since we are the most specialized
place, they come to us

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.110
and we do counseling education.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.250
We have courses and knowledge
for the professionals.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.360
Besides these two main
groups, we have a lot

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.290
of different target groups as well.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.160
We have private and
public companies.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.410
We do a lot of different projects
at IBOS, where we work together

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.480
with other businesses,
and it could be other professionals.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.490
It's a lot from hospitals,
and people working with the elders.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.880
There is also, of
course, next of kin.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.770
All in all, we have a lot to
consider when designing a webpage.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.230
We have people who use
a lot of assistive aids,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.600
so the technical part
has to be perfect,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.830
but we also is a
business that sells.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.214
We also need to have
a very attractive

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:50.730
and visual functioning page.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.670
We have taken this slide to show how
Ole and I work with accessibility.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.870
We always focus on these
four different subjects,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.460
which we think are equally important
when working with accessibility.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.710
It's both the technical part,
the content, the design,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.805
and of course the ease of use,
which is also very, very important.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.300
This brings me to why
are we here today.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.750
We are here today to share the
practical experience we had

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.390
about this IBOS web project.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.510
On this slide, I showed you
two pictures, and on the left,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.100
we have the old IBOS,
the old webpage.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.350
On the right,
we have shown you the new page.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.470
The old IBOS,
we had more than 3000 pages,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.620
and that was not
including all the news.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.280
When we finally changed the page, it
had actually run for almost a decade.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.090
The web change was supposed to
be with the budget, a web company

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.180
with experienced web people who
knew everything about a web process.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.490
Me and my communication colleague
were supposed to be project leaders.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.210
Me and Ole were supposed to
be the accessibility watchdogs

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.520
for everything the
company didn't overcome.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.640
We planned to have a year to do
it, six months full-time,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.990
and it was supposed to be
planned and coordinated,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.730
but this did not happen, of course.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.970
Shortly before we were
to start this project,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:32.200
IBOS started another process of
trying to become self-governing

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.730
from being a public place.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.010
Because of this would change
radically how the webpage would work

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.070
and function,
we had to postpone this project.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.730
We had to wait.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.890
This new process was supposed
to be investigated and finalized

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.670
within six months to a year.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.810
We thought we wait,
but after six months,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:00.420
we could just see that the status
changed, just got prolonged

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.060
and it got prolonged.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.480
Every six months it would happen.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.860
It took a lot longer.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.940
Actually,
I think it took almost four years

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.650
before we had the final status.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.400
During these years,
we slowly neglected the old webpage

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.770
because we didn't want to put all
the money into the system upgrades

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.930
because in a few months
we were to change it.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.250
After a few years,
the reality hit us.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.910
We had created a webpage
that was so defaulted and had

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.220
so many security gaps,
it started to get hacking attempts.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.220
Our key DPR was deeply,
deeply threatened.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.840
The system update was so expensive
now that it would eat half the budget

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.840
for the new page.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.430
This is where the
burning platform came in.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.560
Then we got this idea because
Ole is a very skillful technician

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.830
and in a wing WordPress very well.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.140
We thought, "Okay,
let's make a temporary website.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.190
Let's do it on our own.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.540
We don't need this web
company to do this.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.920
We can probably do it in three
to four months if we hurry.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.270
A lot could talk against this to
3000 pages, that's a lot to do

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.470
in three to four months.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.720
We thought, "Okay,
it could be a big bonus, we're going

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.328
to learn a lot more
about accessibility,

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:20.270
we're going to build it

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.430
from scratch,
we can really try it as we go,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.220
we wouldn't have the middleman,
we could just do it ourselves.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.740
We can get more experienced
and guide others in the end."

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.440
We did it.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.870
We started and two months after
we actually started this project

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.790
and was well underway,
the status of IBOS came to be,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.340
but everything was going
smooth, and it was going well,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.900
and all the target groups
were really pleased.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.440
In the end, this became the final
site for the institute for the blind.

00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:59.660
<v Ole> When it comes
to designing something

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:05.280
for public use in Denmark,
we have some laws,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.190
we have to follow these laws
are the national implementation

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.070
of EU legislation.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:19.540
It began in 2018.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.760
It more or less says, "You have to
comply to the European standard.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.320
When it comes to accessibility,"
that means compliance

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:37.090
with EN 301549, Chapter 9,
which is about web documents.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:48.760
Most of this document actually just
refers to the WCAG 2.1 AA level.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.970
Compliance is actually
hard, but not impossible.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.960
What was really interesting about
compliance was that when we talked

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:10.210
with different developers out
there with the new web design,

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:15.950
we actually had the problem
that we knew more than them.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.020
I think that Nick
stated in the keynote,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:24.670
that he also had problems
finding a place where he could go

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:30.740
to get help and actually have
them do the things right.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.210
We had the same problem.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.620
We knew we wanted compliance,
we thought we could do that.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.850
That was great.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.660
One of the few things that's
important in Denmark when it comes

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.290
to EU legislation is you also have to
have a web accessibility statement.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.850
In Denmark, we have to have a
link in the footer and we have

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:05.620
to have a smart-URL that the
site special vests, which points

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.542
to the Danish web accessibility
statement repository

00:13:11.543 --> 00:13:14.000
in the public bodies.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:20.840
In there, we have described what is
good, what is not good, and so on.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.100
One of the other things
that actually is great

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.510
about the law is there has
to be a feedback mechanism.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.080
For us, we have a phone
number, and we have an email.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.250
We really make it clear
that we don't want people

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.860
sending us personal information,
because that's always a danger

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.640
when it comes to sending
emails, at least for us being

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.820
in the health area.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.020
When it comes to laws and standards,
it's pretty clear what we had to do.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.340
One of the things
that I was happy about

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.410
when we had this problem was when
it comes to these kinds of things.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:12.500
I'm quite more of a system
administrator than a developer.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.140
When choosing what
you want to build on,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.400
I have very great
open-source tools.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.300
That means when you want to build
a website, you can choose really,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.980
really standard
rock-solid foundations.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:37.120
We chose the more or less
standard approach to this Linux,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.860
Apache, MySQL, MariaDB,
and PHP running on Debian.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.003
When we started out we used
the Debian-provided package

00:14:49.004 --> 00:14:50.360
for WordPress,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:57.040
which means that is a really old
Debian I believe 575 something

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.600
but it is provided by the operating
system, it's provided by Debian.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.230
I know they're keeping their
eyes on the system when it comes

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.840
to updates, and I know it plays
well with all the other things.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:17.500
For us not being professional
developers or general, more or less,

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.064
just wanting something
that was really rock solid,

00:15:21.065 --> 00:15:22.130
there was a way to go.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:30.450
We have WordPress 6 recently
updated yesterday to 6.1

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:36.370
on another host minor site, we have
on on the same server actually.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.160
We're learning how to do both.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:51.010
Again, these open-source tools
provided us a rock-solid foundation

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.650
and a way to stand on the shoulder
of the giants who built this,

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.790
which is pretty amazing.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:04.100
We added some CSS and some other
minor templates, and so on.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.410
The goal for this is actually
not to add something, the goal is

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.690
to do something that is simple,
more or less maintenance-free,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:17.440
and have as clear a
back end as we can have,

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.850
and a shiny front end as well.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:28.290
These are the open-source
tools we have on the back end.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.080
When it comes to the
front or the plugins

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.750
we had quite some
problems actually.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:42.660
Because being a very small
language area we have an issue

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.190
with a lot of plugins being partially
or not translated to Danish.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.000
We have a problem with many
of the plugins that we looked

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.410
at were not that accessible.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.050
Every time we looked at plugins,
those were the key points for us,

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:10.270
we had to have our users present
the content in a language

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.240
that they understand that means
Danish, and we have to have plugins

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.670
that are accessible.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:22.220
We have cookie consent, that is
a law, we have to ask the user

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.200
for cookies,
we would like to have breadcrumbs.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.710
That is one of the things Anna
will talk about navigation.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.100
We wanted to accordions
also there is a great plugin

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.740
for that Sitemap again, navigation.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.380
Some help with search,
we found search was hard.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:48.814
Some statistics and again,
for us, text-based geeks,

00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:51.900
we actually like SSH.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.400
That is a plugin for that also.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.110
One of the things that we considered
not that much, but was asked

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.250
to consider I remember
when we launched the site,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.040
a colleague of mine has, "I know
this great accessibility overlay."

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.660
I was like "Okay, I'll look at it."

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.460
What I found out was it
actually broke our compliance,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.740
it meant that we were actually
not accessible but inaccessible.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.170
I chose to ignore the
request about that overlay.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.800
Our boss actually also asked,
"Oh, I've seen these overlays.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320
They're great,
aren't they?" I told him,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.030
"We're actually breaking
compliance, we're actually having

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.810
a problem presenting
accessible content to our users

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.030
if we use these overlays."

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.740
We have not used any overlays,
we don't want to because we want

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.330
to do accessibility the right way.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:54.390
That is actually not by
adding glue or extra content.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.240
Test?

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Anna> Test.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.960
We worked really hard on
this page where you got

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.300
every technical back-end
stuff put together

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.640
with all the front-end
content and design as well.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.000
We went to the part where
we actually wanted to test

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.760
and test even though we had a really
short period of time to do this,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.100
it was a big priority for us because
we think users are very important.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.300
We started with the
in-house with all the teams

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.430
with all our colleagues,
they got the site and they came

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.070
with their views and their inputs
first in the first edition,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.860
then we wanted to get the point
of view of our target groups.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.040
We did a qualitative study where
we interviewed different people

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.530
from our target group.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.740
We did the approach that
was think out loud tests,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.340
which meant that we sat with users
and users got different tasks

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.720
to solve and while doing so they
were supposed to think out loud

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.410
what they met and what happened
so we could get an understanding

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.270
of how they were thinking
while following these tasks.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.190
This was also combined with
a lot of questionnaires

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.960
to the different groups.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.740
This mass together was the
testing kit, and I want to stress

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.760
that we can,
of course not generalize anything.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.310
I think that the testing
we had was about 25.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.090
We can only say what this person
did and why he or her did it,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.330
but it still gave us very many
insights to different things.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.860
When we did the design of this
webpage, we did from the beginning,

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.570
have a lot of focus on alternative
ways to get information, of course.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.790
We wanted to keep it as Ole was
saying, very clean and very simple,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.940
easy to overcome.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.790
You saw the old one,
it was very cluttered.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.050
We of course had a lot of focus
on our contrast and colors,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.710
but even though we are the institute,
we did want to have colors.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:10.290
We wanted to be in line with
our identity, but of course,

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.050
we wanted to reach a triple-A.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.920
We did a special design.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.140
I actually put the picture here
on the slide, on the right.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.860
We have these main menus on the
front page, and they are basically

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.010
with the picture and text.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.060
Then for the people with a vision
impairment, we changed their box

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.090
to this black with yellow writing.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.890
We did it of course,
also for the people with low vision,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.500
so it was easier to see, but a
lot of our users use so much zoom

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.170
that it wasn't primarily for them.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.440
It was also a design decision
to give focus to our area,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.710
so people with a vision
when they came in,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.510
they quickly could get the code,
that this is a special place

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.020
and that we focus on vision.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.060
The yellow text on
black sent this message

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.470
that people here need some
specialized treatments.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.600
We also hope to signal
that we are a place

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.130
that knows very much about this.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.110
Another design thing we
did was that we wanted

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.120
to keep all our content
in the center of the page.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.280
The old website, we had a column to
the left center and to the right,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.740
and it could at times
be very confusing.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.460
At this site, we really wanted
to keep it simple, to have it all

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.570
in one place, and going downward.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.440
The last thing that I brought here
today to what we thought a lot

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.640
about when designing this
was our topography and fund.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.830
This is not part of the WCAG,
but a thing that we really say often,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.860
it's very important to look upon.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.390
I have held talks about this
subject alone, and I'm not going

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.080
to get into that here, but I'll
just say that it's important

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.730
to have a focus on the characteristic
shapes, the large openings

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.990
in a font and that
it's a good space.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:19.520
As I put this picture of
different fonts, a word like 1

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.100
and Illinois is a good
word to test your typings

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.620
because it's usually very hard to see
the difference between the number 1,

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.130
the large I, the small
L, and these words.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:38.140
This is a good tip for something
you can test when choosing your font

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.140
for your pages.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:47.380
This brings me to when we did
the testing, what did we change

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.720
in the design?

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.570
What did come to our intention?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.280
As Ole was into this with the
navigation, we of course had a lot

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.680
of ways to navigate the page,
but I think we got really, really--

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.730
We just saw how important it
actually is with the navigation.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.910
I expected,
and I know some screen users get in

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.250
and they use the arrow down to
look at the page, but in this test,

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.720
we could also see that they
went for the search field,

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.480
or they immediately
opened the element list.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.230
I had a picture of that here as
well in the NVDA screen reader

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.290
where they get all the headings
and all the links immediately.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.070
That shows the importance of
really writing some good link text

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.070
and some good headings.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.670
They also went for
checking page titles.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.470
They found our button,
go to content, and they have a lot

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.660
of different strategies to
access this page where people

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.520
with A vision did as expected.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.050
They went down, they looked,
and they found the main menus

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.050
that we designed.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.780
It's very important
to have many ways in.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:02.560
The search field, I'd like to say
something about, almost everyone

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.900
that used the search field
that we-- One of the things

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.190
that we discovered that we did
wrong, in the beginning,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:16.010
was that we actually did gather
our content in very long pages.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.690
We had this page for people with
visual impairment, and it turned out

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.770
when they were searching
they got one hit,

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.860
which basically could
be a good thing.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.730
It's not a lot to be confused
with, but the pages were so long.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.030
When you were using a screen
reader, it was very difficult

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.010
to find the content within that page,
whereas we could see that people

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.620
with A vision had no
problems because the colors

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.400
and the design made it easier
to find the different sections.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.790
Actually, after testing,
we split up some pages again,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.630
so we got more pages and more
search results, but it's easier

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.170
to access the different contents.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.110
I still think all in all today,
I think we have had 65 pages

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.480
on this side compared to
the old where we have 3000.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:07.570
We still have focused
our content a lot.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.610
One more thing that
on this page we have,

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.280
we don't have very many
pictures and graphical objects,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.420
but after testing,
we even had fewer on the sides

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.130
that were directly targeted
people who use assistive aids,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.460
so if it doesn't have any
meaning, we took it away

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.500
so it doesn't make a lot of noise.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.480
The last point where we
really changed the designs,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:38.000
and we will share that experience,
is that we saw that a lot

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.620
of the people got cornered
or stuck when they finished

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.410
when it came down to the end of
a page and finished the content,

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.770
where were they to go?

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.080
We actually ended up designing a
lot of more go back to the main page

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.870
or didn't you find what
you were looking for?

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.870
Go here.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.510
In the end, I guess I put the
last picture on this slide,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:06.300
we added that to the top with the
visual arrow up and showing its link.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.190
If you ended there,
you got back up again.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.800
Basically, we found more ways
to guide the user around.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:27.750
Then the content part of our website,
we did always have a big focus

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.170
on easy language.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:34.040
We have a very complex professional
language with a lot of long,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.510
complex words.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:40.860
Of course, we really focused on
making the language more accessible

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.480
and easy to read.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.740
We also, all through, have a
very big focus on language use.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.760
We believe that you aren't your
handicap, but you have one.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.970
We make a big effort to
write people with a handicap

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:03.610
and not handicapped
people, but after we tested

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.400
with some different users,
we got more attention points,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.840
and some of the testing we
did, and some of the task was

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:17.740
to find some of the employment
offers we have for the target groups,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.890
but very quickly we could see
they got no hits when trying

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.860
to find this in the search
field because this subject

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.440
or area has so many
different names.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.840
You can write job, profession,
it could be work, occupation,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.240
employment, and of
course, the person

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.420
who was testing it didn't use
the same vocabulary as we did.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.610
We get back and all the big areas,
we started using a lot of synonyms

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.050
to find and get this
into the content.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.460
Then also, a thing we discovered
was with the page titles,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.780
and that how we editors sometimes
can get a bit too creative.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:03.540
We had a lot of videos, and podcasts
with a lot of good inspiration

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.930
and we thought we are going
to collect this in a page,

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.800
and we called it Find Inspiration.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.900
It's brilliant, but
testing, again, we saw

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.500
that the users didn't find anything
because they search on video,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.830
they search on
podcasts, and no hits.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.750
Being specific is another advice.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.960
Now we split it up and
we have a podcast side

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.460
and we have a video side and
the creativity side, we use it

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.660
in other places.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.150
Then one more point
was that we spend a lot

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.720
of time guiding our users
in the text, for example,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.490
we have this, contact our teams
and at the beginning of that page,

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:50.670
we make sure we have texts that
say the content here is written

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:55.950
in alphabetical order in three
columns so that the user who use zoom

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:01.330
or screen readers know how to search
for the information before starting.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.890
That is also some small things
we do to make it easier.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.120
In the end, I'm just going
to say that, make a checklist

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.470
and give it to your editors.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.760
Even though we are many people
here, it's really easy

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.290
that you forget a small thing,
alternative text, the headings,

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.630
put it in right, and very slowly,
it gets all inaccessible again.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.870
That was my last good advice.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.462
I think that was it for this slide.

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:31.296
<v Ole> Yes.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.430
When we design for
screen reader users,

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:44.020
we're actually having some issues
always because screen reader users

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.500
are very complex.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.980
There are different screen
readers that do different things

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.110
in a different way.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.890
For instance, there is a very
much difference on how voiceover

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.000
on the iPhone works compared to,
for instance, NVDA or SuperNova.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:08.680
One of the things when it
comes to that is more or less,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.040
even though they're different,
they comply to the same things.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.000
There are some differences when
it comes to which area attributes

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.900
and so on, they conform to but more
or less they're okay, all of these.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.610
Users have different levels of
experience and different ways

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.980
of doing things.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.186
The complexity here
might not actually be

00:31:34.187 --> 00:31:36.400
in the excessive technology,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.660
but also in the users,
there are different veracity levels.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.340
There are different languages.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.300
There are different voices.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.190
For instance, we have a Danish voice
that pronounces some words really,

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.360
really strange.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.430
You can actually hear on
some of our blind users

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.890
which voice they're using.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:08.330
That's a complex issue,
not complex as it can't be solved

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.680
because there are actually some
very good guidelines when it comes

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.330
to accessibility for screen
reader users in the WCAG.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.300
If you look there,
you don't have to be scared,

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.770
but some of the things
when it comes to the users

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.670
and the way they use the webpage
are where the problems can start.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.580
One of the things we found out was
we actually want to help our users.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.000
We made a guide for the
users of screen readers.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.940
That meant we tried to describe
how the pages were built,

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.040
how are they marked up
when it comes to headings.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.140
Are there things
they are not used to?

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.870
One of the things that some
of our users were not used

00:32:51.871 --> 00:32:53.590
to were accordions.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.670
We described how they
use these accordions,

00:32:56.671 --> 00:32:58.770
and what were their function.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.830
They were buttons,
maybe headings, and so on.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.930
They could be folded
in and out and so on.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.470
Giving the users some
guidance were key.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.110
One of the things that we actually
always discuss more or less is,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.490
is it a problem that we have
when it comes to accessibility.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.840
Is it a technical problem
or is it a user problem

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.290
because some of the
feedback we get is hard?

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:32.580
For instance,
Anna mentioned the title attribute.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:38.480
I think to the most part,
we actually have great titles,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:45.850
but what if the user actually wants
to read out the link for a page?

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:51.490
Will that give the user some idea of
where the user is on this webpage?

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.700
Not necessarily,
but we have users that try that.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.380
That is one of the things we can
say, how can we fix this?

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.710
Is it a user problem?

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.000
Can we describe to the user
how we want them to interact

00:34:06.001 --> 00:34:07.090
with the webpage?

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.690
Some of the issues we have
are actually user issues

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.080
because using a
screen reader is hard.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.140
It is complex.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.960
When we test and when we do some
of the tests with screen readers,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.440
we keep our focus very
much upon the WCAG

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.480
because are we perceiving
this correctly?

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.910
Are we understanding this?

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:39.490
Are we able to operate this?

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.930
Are we able to have a
robust way to do this

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:50.950
because that is the technical
way we can catch this?

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.080
Some of the things that are actually
hard sometimes are understanding

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.970
how things will be pronounced,
abbreviations, are they correct,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.970
are they not?

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.000
Actually, some things are hard even
because we are a small language area.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.390
That means that, for instance,
if we want to have an English page,

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.910
we have to make sure
it's marked up correctly.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.820
For us, we're not using something
like Polylang, multi-poly,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.490
I don't know right now but
we have an English template

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.860
that marks up the
language in parts.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:41.270
The heading or the banner, the
navigation area will be in Danish.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.880
If the screen reader actually
understands how this markup is done,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.520
it will be read out in Danish.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.650
When it comes to the English content,
it will switch to the English voice.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:36:00.290
That is, VK 311,312, that we are
actually trying to be aware of.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.480
That is actually one of the
things that are really hard

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.990
when it comes to the difficulties
we're having that is the language.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.210
Yes, time's running.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.410
Low vision users, we test,
of course, when it comes to them,

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.850
and that is actually really
hard because people use

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.430
different magnifications.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.920
When it comes to the WCAG, we have
a text resize that means we have

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:33.790
to be able to resize the text
to 200% but that's actually not

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.860
what our users use.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.240
They use full-screen magnification
sometimes up to eight times,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.720
and that actually means
that the area they see

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.200
if the screen is
really, really small.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.140
Sometimes they use color
filters, color enhancements,

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.640
focus enhancements, that is a big
bright yellow arrow or something.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.560
Sometimes, they use click to read.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.540
They have many ways
into using a webpage.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.440
One of the things
that, for instance,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.890
Anna talked about was the
way we designed the black

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:09.150
with yellow text-on, the entrance
for the low vision users.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.610
When you use color enhancements,
not inverse colors,

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.360
but reverse colors,
I think it's called in zoom text,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.650
you would get the black to be white,
but the yellow keeps being yellow.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.520
That means the contrast was horrible
and is horrible, but it is one

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.960
of the things that actually
is hard to do something about.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.280
That is an editorial thing that
we have to figure out how we want

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.690
to do that.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.950
Low vision users, colors, and
magnifications are actually something

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.680
that's even harder when you ask
me than screen reader users.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.810
What have we learned?

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:53.450
We have to start from the
beginning and choose wisely.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.220
The fundamentals are hard to
change once we have started.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.179
It is very, very, very excellent

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.580
if you could have an
accessibility expert

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.520
at your side because no matter how
good you think the bureau you have

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.700
at your side is,
they're not that great.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.580
That's a key point.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.820
One of the other key points
is content is actually

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.630
the most important thing.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.840
It's not the technical
stuff, it is the content.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.040
When the solution is done,
when you are more or less secure

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.980
in the accessibility of the
platform, you have to be aware

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.570
that the content editors will be
able to screw this up, train them.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.930
Have a starting point, a
plan, and work from there.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.470
Accessibility is a project.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.080
We're not there yet,
but we have to keep going,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.200
but there will never
be a finishing line.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.520
There will be new standards.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.270
There will be new excessive
technologies and so on and so on.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.120
As Anna has done, test, test, test.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.590
The people we have doing testing
with us are actually our goal.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.600
They're our treasure because they
find the things that we cannot.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.570
What would we like to do more?

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:11.190
Time-based media is actually
something we would like an easy way

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:14.780
to do because that
is actually hard.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:21.760
One of the things with the ASL
Interpreter is great having that.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.860
I know some of our users will
love to have that on our video

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.140
and time-based media,
so an easy way to do that,

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.990
we would be greatly appreciative.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:39.420
We would like more time and put
effort into helping our users,

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.930
both when it comes to
accessibility and usability issues.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:47.930
Of course, the editors and
coworkers we have, we want them

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.880
to be even better at accessibility
and usability issues.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.600
We have a lot of integration
problems when it comes

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.960
to some of the platforms.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.390
For instance, we use Moodle.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.570
We have other different
platforms that we want to tie in

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.520
and integrate,
and we can do that better.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.860
That is one of the other things
we would like to do better

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.850
and we would like also to
test, test, test.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:22.040
I think that almost
makes it our time.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:25.380
I will stop-- [crosstalk]

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.440
<v Kim> Thank you so much.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.170
No, you did perfect on the time.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.750
Absolutely perfect.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:30.450
<v Ole> Oh, thank you.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Kim> I loved all the memes
and the graphics in your slides.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.640
I was just like, "Oh,
what's the next meme going to be?"

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.235
[laughter]

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:38.790
We're going to start the Q&amp;A.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.910
If you're watching live, you can
still add questions in the chat area

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.410
or in the Q&amp;A section
of the chat area.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.370
Our first question was what was
some of the feedback you received

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:53.010
from users who are blind or
visually impaired about the flow

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.730
of the content?

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.550
For example,
were they searching for links first,

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.530
previewing headings first,
or scanning the content?

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.527
Could you just talk
to that a little bit?

00:41:03.743 --> 00:41:07.510
<v Anna> I think, actually,
the users we had primarily did one

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.310
of the things.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.990
I think the users, they went
straight to the search field.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.980
Every time they got a new task,
they went back on the search,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.760
again, for new words or the new
thing they were looking for,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.310
so they kept doing
that in that direction.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:26.620
It seemed like a lot of users
have their favorite way to do it.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.340
The persons who wanted to use the
element list used that very much

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.040
to guide the way through
in every page and people

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.260
who used the search
field used that.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.350
We didn't see many that switched
between all of the different things.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.440
I think the user we have the
data the most was the user

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.820
who used Apple's screen
reader voiceover.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.750
I think that screen reader has a
bit more, and Ole knows a lot more

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.810
about that but has this more
options to change between

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.830
how it searches than some
of the other screen readers.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.380
That's what we saw that it was
very-- They went for one strategy

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.160
and they used that but the mass
used very different strategies.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.150
<v Ole> It is actually a great
question because as one that teaches

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:19.860
some of our users how to use a
screen reader, it actually comes

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.870
as a surprise to me sometimes
how people navigate,

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.800
because one of the things I
would really like them to do,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.660
and I wrote the help we
have to screen reader users,

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.420
I would really like them to be aware
of how the content is marked up.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.090
When it comes to headings,
I would like them to know

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.750
that we have done links, and so on.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.550
What we're seeing is actually
some people are using

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:53.950
something like job search, which is
actually just searching the raw text

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:59.250
and not using how the content is
marked up, which is actually strange

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.250
to me.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.130
They might not be using
something like the elements list

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:09.440
or something but something
like voiceovers, content lists,

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.740
and searching, those are actually
a very easy ways to do it.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:18.190
I think it's not a one size
fits all but it's actually quite

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.400
a great question.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.630
I think the arrow also points back
to those of us who teach people

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.400
how to use screen readers,
that we make people more aware

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.160
of the possibilities they have.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:38.140
What I experience is much
content is actually accessible

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:43.980
but the user don't know how
to do it or how to access it.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.870
That is an explanation
that they need.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.270
That is something that we
need to provide for them.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Anna> I think also,
some of the users aren't experts.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.030
I also tested with some of our
ICT specialists here at IBOS

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.440
that are blind.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.320
Of course, there's a huge difference
in testing with the person

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.640
who actually works with this every
day and knows the screen reader,

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.750
they have so many more ways
to do it and options compared

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:16.700
to an ordinary user who clearly had
learned how to do this really well

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.850
and went for that strategy
all the way through.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.900
It's a big difference in their
experience level as well.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.430
<v Kim> I guess on that
point of testing, I'm curious

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.080
if you have any recommendations
for finding the right types

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.400
of people to test and that
audience of people because I know

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.020
that's a challenge you said
within your own friends and family

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.090
and the access you have
in your organization,

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.420
do you have any
recommendations for people

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.780
to conduct these types of testability
user tests with their audience?

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:47.750
<v Anna> Yes.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.480
I think it's really important
that you get the full width.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.500
We see that it's such a big
difference between our co-workers

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.050
who are very good at using
their assistive technology.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:05.220
That you need to find some of the
users that aren't that good but,

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.990
of course, that's the discussion
that we also need to help our users

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.410
because I don't think you
should design for the users

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.400
who are very inexperienced as well.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.030
It's to find some middle ground.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.130
Some issues might be hard for the
users who have less experience

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.840
but then with the guide
we did for screen readers,

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.590
we hope to lift them up a bit
so it doesn't have to design

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:33.350
for the lowest,
but can find some middle ground.

00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:38.840
<v Ole> I think it's really important
that you are aware when testing

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.760
and doing, of course, both manual
and automatic testing, both is great.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:49.240
That you reach out to the
user groups that you have.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:57.250
I think Nick also said,
"Build it with us, not for us,"

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.960
in the opening keynote.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.620
I think that's a really smart way
of saying it because if you build it

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:11.030
for something that you think users
would want, you will go wrong.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.420
You have to be robust when it
comes to having this feedback

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.580
because it will not all be
great, but you have to reach out,

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.890
and you have to make sure
that your ears are open,

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:26.150
I have really big ears used,
so that should be no problem.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.760
You have to reach out and you have
to be humble when it comes to it

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.370
and you have to be willing
to want to change something.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.700
Another point is, I think you have
to give something to the people

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.860
when you want their help.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.360
You have to provide
something for them

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.860
because you're actually
wanting them to work for free.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.513
That is not that good.

00:46:55.513 --> 00:46:57.450
[laughs].

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:57.930
Reach out.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:58.740
Be humble.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.040
Be great.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.540
<v Kim> I agree.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.860
I agree completely.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.680
This is a question about the
secondary benefits of this redesign.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.969
You focused largely
on the accessibility,

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.550
on streamlining the content.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.680
Could you speak to any
of the improvements

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.310
of other metrics like core read
vitals or of just analytics

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.370
and how it was
optimized and how it's

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.230
being used now that you've got
after this huge investment of time

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.107
to create?

00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:26.190
<v Ole> Oh, yes.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.440
[laughs]

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.230
That is something we
actually argue about daily.

00:47:31.717 --> 00:47:34.284
[laughter]

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:36.850
I might get smacked now.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:42.540
I am not interested in
a lot of those metrics.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.600
I know Anna is.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:52.120
I'm probably one of those,
with a bit of arrogance,

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.770
saying if I build
it, they will come.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:48:03.380
I'm more or less focused on
the other end of the scale.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.480
I want to build something that's
good, so I believe it will be used.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:14.960
Our metrics, I don't know how
they are compared to the old page,

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.490
but we have metrics, of course.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Anna> We have metrics
and that's the kind of--

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.850
I don't think we have enough
metrics on this new page.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:23.300
<v Ole> [laughs].

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.820
<v Anna> With the old page,
we had Google Analytics,

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.090
and I had a lot of different
insights and I could see a lot

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.780
of different things.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.460
We actually are reaching our
one-year anniversary with this site.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.640
Therefore, I really want to
go down to the metrics again

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.260
and see how are we
doing, what can we see.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:46.100
The new analytic tool we have, it
doesn't show as much as the old one.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.120
I can see some basic things and
I can see we have good results.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.380
We had a lot more visitors than we
did before, and stuff like that,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.980
but I can't see very
deeply through that.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.750
That is definitely one of
the things that I have wanted

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.040
to have more data and we are
trying to upgrade that part.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.897
<v Kim> [laughs]

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.020
It is a trade-off.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.300
Just knowing that you've built
something that you're very proud

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.100
of that you know is so far an
improvement from what it was

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.050
prior to that, I'm sure that
the metrics, when you look

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.680
at them again, you'll just be
like, "Oh, we're good,"

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.791
and that annual check-in
might be enough.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.860
[laughs].

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.750
<v Anna> People are coming and
saying good stuff so we hope that

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.910
if something is really
wrong, people will say it,

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.700
but we can see we
have a lot of visitors

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.060
and that's the most
important thing.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.170
<v Kim> We have a question
from our moderator.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:38.840
Other than the visual content and
the focus on visually impaired

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.290
or limited vision, do you also
have a category that's focused

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:44.415
on learning by audio?

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:51.360
<v Anna> We do have-- I'm not sure
what this is but we do work a lot

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:58.620
with podcasts and some assets you
have a lot of our knowledge given

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:04.350
in the-- I'm not sure what the--

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:07.200
<v Ole> The podcasts,
that dimension is very aerial.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.160
I believe that's more or less it.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:14.970
Also, that is not directly on
the main page but we have content

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:18.160
when it comes to learning,
we have the Moodle platform

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.260
where we put content that is
time-based media that is text-based.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.890
We like text because it's searchable,
it's doable for many of our users.

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.360
We're not actually so
much focused on audio.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.440
It's a great way.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.650
Having the podcast is a great way.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.036
<v Anna> We do a lot of
podcasts, yes.

00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:41.038
<v Ole> Text is great for us.

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:42.506
At least.

00:50:43.483 --> 00:50:44.880
It's a bit of both.

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Kim> I'm going to throw this
one in really quick this question.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.330
You mentioned this
guide for screen readers

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.830
to help them navigate
sections like an accordion.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.390
Is that intermixed with the
content where it's presented

00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:00.790
or is it a standard guide that's
persistent across the site,

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:03.193
but it's one documentary?

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Ole> Yes, it's one document.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.520
The reason for that is because
it would disturb the flow

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.820
when reading a document
where I would intertwine it.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.100
I think it's a good idea.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.470
I think that could be
something we could work on

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:22.210
because you would have to jump
back and forth for instance

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:27.520
or read the screen reader guide to
get the information somewhere else.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.310
I have in the screen reader
guide integrated the elements

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.560
that we're wanting to show them.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.780
When the screen reader
guide discusses accordion,

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.496
there is an accordion,
they can practice,

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.065
they can see how those work.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Kim> Perfect.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.730
We have a couple more questions,
but they're telling me to cut off.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.580
I appreciate both of
you having been here.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.760
Thank you so much, Anna and Ole.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.970
I'm sorry, I pronounced your name
incorrectly at the beginning.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.870
It was a great presentation
and we're all going

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:54.280
to go check your website out now.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.779
<v Ole> Thank you very much.

00:51:56.353 --> 00:51:57.814
<v Kim> Thank you everyone else.

00:51:57.815 --> 00:51:58.520
<v Ole> Thanks for having us.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520
Bye-bye.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.970
