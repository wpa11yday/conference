00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.609
<v Danielle Zarcaro> Hello.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.650
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.150
My name is Danielle and I'm the
founder of Overnight Website

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.850
and Kinetic Iris Web
Development Studio.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.080
Thank you for joining us for
Developing Accessibility-First

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.960
WordPress themes with Nikole
Garcia and Annie Heckel.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.210
A little bit about them.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.450
Nikole works with local
educators and community partners

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.740
to teach technology to students and
those who are new to the industry.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.330
Annie is web accessibility specialist
and educator currently working

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.330
to ensure that Cornell
University's web properties have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.130
as few accessibility
barriers as possible.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.190
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&amp;A tab next

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.200
to the video, and we'll answer
them at the end of the session.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.540
You can also use the idea section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:44.113
<v Nikole Garcia>
Hi, it's live now?

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:48.136
Hi.

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.076
Sorry.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:54.920
As I move through my slideshow.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.880
First of all, I'm Nikole, and this
is Annie, as we were introduced.

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.441
<v Annie Heckel> Hello.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Nikole> When I told Annie
that I wanted to do a talk

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.510
about making accessibility-first
themes, she was a little surprised.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.710
She was from the a11y media already

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.670
and everything is
accessibility-first for her.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.540
I said this is not
this way in development

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.010
where accessibility is added
on after long in the form

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.590
of a checklist or especially for
clients, if it's added on at all.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.200
Usually developers have no
workflow to allow the space

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.670
for accessibility or the
process to architect or test it,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.420
and so hopefully this talk will
help everyone gain a new insight

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.750
in how we can make this
work for agencies and teams.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.090
I also want to show the audience
that accessibility auditors

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.600
and the developers who
have to perform the code,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.210
they aren't really
against each other.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.910
In our former jobs, I even survived
an audit done by Annie's company,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.350
and we're still friends,
so that is a possible thing.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.860
So, accessibility-first.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.820
What do we mean when we say
accessibility-first in the context

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.400
of this talk?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.840
I'm looking for an architecture that
provides the best user experience

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
for all users.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.740
The architecture puts accessibility
before coding and design is done

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.820
to save money and time as
the components won't need

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.220
to be recoded or redesigned
after they're already created

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.520
in a non-accessible way.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.550
Putting that effort into
the architecture guides

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.300
the overall development process
with all the stakeholders

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.424
from content to marketing,
to design and development.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Annie> Here we go.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.060
Nikole's going to go over a number
of different possible approaches

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.490
as we get into the presentation
here, but no matter

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.320
which of the following approaches
you use, keeping these basic elements

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.220
of accessibility in the forefront as
you create your theme will help you

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.700
to make good decisions.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.554
Following the principles
of perceivable,

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:11.730
operable, understandable,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.340
and robust which made guiding
concepts for WCAG version 2,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.160
as everybody who knows WCAG
will know, and Then falling back

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.650
on the WCAG can make it a lot
easier to ensure that you're

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.620
at the very least meeting
the accessibility baseline.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.580
Then build for the end user's
needs and not for the needs

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.310
of developers and designers.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.640
If you think about end user needs,
you're more likely to shift away

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.630
from the minimum accessibility
and get into actual usability.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.290
Just going beyond that baseline
that we get when we adhere to WCAG.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.970
Then of course as always, semantic
HTML is always the big thing.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.110
Whenever you can use it,
whenever you can build again,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.600
always do since it usually has the
accessibility support built right in.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.130
That said, do keep in mind
you can't cover all the bases.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.420
There are going to be some
things where designers

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.740
and content creators have to
step up and take responsibility.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.110
This is a lesson I learned in my
previous life as a college professor.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.140
I could never anticipate all of my
students mistakes, so I just had

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.480
to be able to roll with it and deal
with whatever they threw at me.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.750
Of course, you won't be able
to stop the users of your theme

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.120
from making some bad choices in
terms of design or content entry.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.300
Things like poor color contrasts,
misusing the heading tags.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.890
If your theme's base framework
is built for accessibility,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.600
that'll make the end user experience
better pretty much by default.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.150
Back over to Nikole.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Nikole> Which brings us to,
speaking of designing for users

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.480
and not the people who have
to use the site, the people

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.740
who own the site,
WordPress site builders.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.210
A lot of times people talk
about building themes.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.800
We talk about how they're
going to be assembled,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.720
and site builders is one of the
ways in which many people choose

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.160
to build a WordPress site.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.990
They're very popular.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.930
A lot of clients ask for
them, but they come with a lot

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.140
of accessibility problems.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.870
Like Annie was saying,
if you give anybody the ability

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.700
to just style things at will,
some really bad things can happen.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.950
For example,
this might be some of the code

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.030
that you generate the site builder.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.580
The editor for that content can
come along and they can add things.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.010
These two things could look
the same on the frontend

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.680
to the person editing the stuff,
but for a accessibility view,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.660
these are very, very,
very different things.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.760
Obviously, they don't have
the semantic tags to them.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.220
They can have very different
meanings when you look at them

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.540
in different devices.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.060
And that's why we're trying to move
away from that style of development.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.190
For avoiding the site builders,
what should we use instead?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.620
For the best accessibility
and a truly built-in process,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.780
and I'm going to go back
through this several times

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.720
about having a built-in process,
because the more you can have

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.140
a built-in process, the less you
have wiggle room for accessibility

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.290
to go very wrong.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.450
For a built-in process,
you're probably going to need

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.230
to go the development route.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.980
We're going to go through
a few paths today to try

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.770
and figure out what
that looks like to make

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.480
a truly accessible
development process.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.460
One of the options is headless.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.200
Headless sites separate the
WordPress content management

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.540
from the frontend delivery.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.340
You have your content being
served with a normal WordPress

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.160
content manager, and then you pull
it out via REST or GraphQL

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.050
Most of the frontends for
headless are now JavaScript apps

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.210
or static HTML sites,
which are lightning fast.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.980
The biggest argument for that is
that at least for accessibility

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.510
as you can give your users options
on what frontend they would want

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.500
to see, or you can change the
default based on what device

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.900
or browser the user has.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.780
While headless is the most
development-intensive,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.230
I do believe it can be streamlined
into being much easier.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.200
There are many hosting services that
make headless deployment easier like,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.090
WP Engine has a
service called Atlas.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.980
With headless, you can also
separate design from content,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.100
and limit the content into ways that
make accessibility support easier,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.600
which we're going to
talk a little bit later.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.760
Most of the headless sites now
use reactor view in the frontend.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.660
Although, I've recently been enjoying
doing some Gatsby static sites,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.460
so that's another option too.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720
Custom themes.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.810
When it comes to custom themes
in accessibility, what you want

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.310
to do is not recreate
the wheel every time.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.230
If you start with an existing
theme, and have

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.040
to add on all your support in a
piecemeal way like add a plugin here,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.400
plugin there, change a few things,
things are bound to get left out,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.660
and the process takes
a really long time.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.120
Then companies start to complain
about the development cycle

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.240
being too long,
about things going wrong.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.250
That's when it really goes wrong.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.620
If you aim for a build process,
if you like building a theme by hand,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.090
you can add in the accessibility
supports without having

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.840
to create them from scratch.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.930
You then replicate
your base each time

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.530
and then add your final touches
with styles and components

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.030
to create a unique site.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:19.030
Much like this GIF of building
the car, you take this blueprint

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.700
that builds your base car,
and then you get to add the paint

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.390
and trim to make each car unique.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.080
In the resources in the
end, I've added some links

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.360
to a few theme frameworks
you can use to get started

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.220
with this route in the repo.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.380
If you start with a base that has
a built-in process like WP Rig

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.990
or Sage, you can add
your components to that

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.020
and keep building new themes on top
of it, each site looking unique,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.070
but sticking with the same
base accessibility components

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.292
that you have set for.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.860
Sorry, I'm struggling with
my braces and they stick

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:15.320
to my lips every once in a while.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.180
Framework flow.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.360
How do we put this together and
make it easier for an agency

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.480
to have the custom building process
while also adding in accessibility?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.250
Your first step is to identify
the common elements used

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.100
in multiple sites and put
them together in one place.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:38.810
This could be headers or menus,
or footers, call-out boxes, forms,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.810
and so on.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.790
It's important to lay down the
scaffolding for accessibility

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.600
and styling, but not to assign
specific styles to your base.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.770
You're going to add the specific
styles later, the individual theme.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.980
You just want to create your base
that has all of your components

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.980
that you want.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.100
The idea here is that
accessibility supports are built

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.760
into the process and the
framework, they won't get left out.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.350
Making them default makes
them included in the end.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.360
You can also include the list
of plugins you're going to label

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.030
as must use such as advanced
custom fields, which we'll talk

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.530
about a little bit if you want
to use that, or say you want

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.430
to require Yoast to make
an automated site map

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.070
to add new pages to, because
that's very good for accessibility.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.810
This is what it might look like.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:48.250
On the top here, you have your
base theme building materials,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.110
your components, your supports,
your must-use plugins,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.060
and your base styles.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.310
That is your base repository
that you're going to start all

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.310
of your themes from.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.500
Then on the bottom,
you're going to add in per site

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.420
that you have your custom
styles and your images.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.970
That's going to be on
a per project basis.

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.424
You then combine them
into a build process

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:15.930
to make each individual theme.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.440
This process is nearly the same for
headless and for custom theme sites.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.550
For headless, you might have
two build processes outlined.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:31.500
You might have one for the
actual theme, and then there one

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.750
might be one for the frontend.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.330
Then for the custom theme,
you might just have one build process

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.330
for the theme.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.250
Then you might need a document
that outlines the setup

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.110
of your site and any plugins.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.040
Limiting content, and this is
the part we get in a little bit

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.490
of trouble with the other
departments in an agency.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.070
Why would we want to do that,
and what does that mean?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.050
When we are talking about the
site builders, we're talking about

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.310
how users can do some crazy things.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.620
What we're trying to do is
we're trying to guide and shape,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.440
and give them some rules about
what they can and can't put

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.250
into the pages.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.180
We're limiting the number of
inputs that they can be added

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.980
to the editing screens.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.810
They can't free-build the thing
and then hurt accessibility.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.280
All of the code or all the content
would be pulled into a code layer

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.260
so it's separating the
code and the content.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:49.090
We can also use this to add
functionality automatically

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.780
to the content, such as adding
"read more" links to the headings,

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.760
because we have the content
providers just add in the words

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.260
and not make links themselves.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.080
We're going to do
two examples of this.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.270
One is a Gutenberg example of the
Gutenberg builder in WordPress.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.840
The other one is with ACF
or advanced custom fields.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.510
If I wanted someone to make
an alert box in the content,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.170
I could tell them to do a standard
code block and put some code

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.220
in the editor like this.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.630
It might get the job done,
but it's also not very standardized

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.650
and it allows for a lot of error.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:47.530
If I want to add in other
supports of this, I can't do that

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.710
because we have these code blocks
and they're set to the content.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:03.620
Alternatively, if I could
make a custom Gutenberg block.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.760
This is when they're
doing the page editing.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.690
They would add this block,
and their only options are to choose

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:20.040
what kind of alert they want
and to put the text in there.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.010
They don't have the option
of just free-coding it.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.580
They don't have the option of
reinventing their own wheels here.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.470
They can only do this.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.620
This helps for two things.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.350
One is that, like I said,
they don't have the option

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.980
of just making it up there.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.610
Two, say if the accessibility
standards change later,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.670
I can just change the
block in one place

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.960
and make this thing appear
differently later, and I don't have

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.540
to go through every post and find
every block that we use that way.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.910
We're not going to specifically
discuss how to make the blocks

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.120
in this talk, but I did post
some of the resources to the repo

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:10.420
for this talk, if you were interested
in learning how to do those.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.360
Here's our other example.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.610
It's advanced custom fields.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.750
This is nice because it's a
much more user-friendly thing.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.350
You don't have to have people
with coding knowledge who can go

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.290
in there and be able
to add the fields.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.260
Here, say we have a
post and at the bottom

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.280
of the post we have these special
fields for our run details,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.980
and we have a purpose and a
distance, and it limits

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.180
how people can inter-text in
here because they don't have

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.830
to remember to add the
distance, they don't have

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.030
to remember purpose, but it also
pulls their content in a way

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.800
that if I wanted to link the
distance to a chart or something,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.100
I can do that.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.140
I can also add any supports
I need to the content

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.190
that gets pulled out in that way.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.920
It separates the content from
the presentation, basically.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.620
ACF also makes blocks now with
the latest pro edition of ACF.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.160
You can make these custom
blocks that you can use

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.540
with a WordPress post or the
site editor, full site editing.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:28.240
Here, the developer has defined
a quote block that someone

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.300
who is using this quote block
can only make the quote text

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.700
and the author, and the
title, and then add an image.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.970
They can't do anything
else with the block.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.530
This block can have supports built
in to the frontend to display

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.810
in a proper way based
on user preference.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.630
If the user wants dark text,
light text, larger text,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.330
they can do all that because
it's not locked into the content.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:09.630
The nice thing about the ACF
and the ACF blocks, sorry,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:15.290
braces sticking, are that they
allow you to export the fields

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.960
and the other structures
that you create.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.060
They can be used on multiple
sites without someone having

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.880
to manually enter the
stuff on all the sites.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.560
It's part of the build process to
include these fields and blocks

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.850
in your theme, and not a manual
of one thing that makes it easier

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.960
for you to not leave anything out.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Annie> Just some general
tips to start wrapping up.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.790
One that I had to get in as the
accessibility person is a warning

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.060
about ARIA.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.200
Because one of probably
the most common things

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.571
I see causing a big failure
when someone's been trying

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:09.100
to make something accessible
is that they heard

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.000
about ARIA somewhere somehow,
and somebody told them

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.320
that ARIA can make it all better.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.200
It can make it communicate with the
screen reader and it'll be all great.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.820
People will just take ARIA and
sprinkle it in like some kind

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.660
of magic accessibility
dust, which it is not.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.398
ARIA is awesome, but the first rule

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:37.050
of ARIA is essentially
don't use ARIA.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.820
More realistically,
it's don't use ARIA for something

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.280
where you can actually
use HTML instead.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.120
If you've got semantic HTML that
will do whatever it is you're trying

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.780
to do with ARIA,
always use the HTML, not the ARIA.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.230
If for some reason you can't
use the semantic HTML to do

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.070
whatever it is you need to do, that's
when you start to bring in ARIA.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.400
If you bring in ARIA, make sure
that you know how to use it.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.120
It's very exacting.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.360
It's got its own specification.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.290
If you want to use ARIA,
you got to make sure you go learn

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.720
the ARIA specification, figure
out what the relationships are,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.480
what different ARIA roles can be used
on, and what different ARIA states

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.400
and properties.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:31.000
Can you use it on
this component or not?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.220
Can you use it on this
HTML element or not?

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.890
Because there's a lot of
rules, and ARIA states

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.480
and properties are not all global.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.260
Some of them are very,
very limited and can only be applied

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.260
to certain things.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.790
With that, no ARIA is better
than using ARIA badly.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.250
I don't think I've yet seen
anybody really mess things up

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.250
by inappropriately applying ARIA,
but you can make things confusing.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.730
A good for instance on this
is that the ARIA label is one

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.470
of the things that probably
pops up the most often.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.480
It's an attribute that you
can use to add an invisible

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.400
and accessible name that
you won't see on the screen,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.070
but that'll get picked
up by assisting tech.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.860
The thing that people don't always
realize about ARIA labels, aside

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.670
from the fact that
you could only use it

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.180
on interactive user
interface components, is that

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.240
if you put an ARIA
label on a component

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.600
and you already had a visible label
for that component, like say a link,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.020
you had a link that was
actually around some actual text

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.340
and then you put an ARIA label on
the link, the ARIA label's going

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.370
to take the place of the
link text that was visible.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.820
If you have something different
in the ARIA label than you had had

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.430
in the visible text,
that can get really, really weird

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.840
for sighted users who happen
to also use a screen reader

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.720
for whatever problem.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.680
No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.180
If you're going to use ARIA,
make sure you know how you use it,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.720
go look up the specification
and be careful.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.150
The other general tip
is that less is more.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.740
Don't try to do too much
with any one component.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.030
The good example here is don't
have your main navigation add

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.170
every single page
that you come up with.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.900
Because if you have a really
gigantic main navigation,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.650
and we all know how mega menus
feel, when you try to get into them

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.700
and you can't find that
one thing that you want,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.710
imagine having that happen if you can
only hear the page coming through.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.350
Instead of seeing the
giant mess of text,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:57.450
instead you're just hearing
more and more, and more choices.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.550
You wouldn't want to have a main
menu that has all the things in it.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.190
You do need to satisfy multiple ways,
so instead you do something like

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.490
what Nikole mentioned
earlier, having a site map

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.540
that automatically creates links
to new pages as you add them.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.440
That way you've got all of the
content and all of the links there

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.910
for multiple ways fulfillment,
but it's not always front and center

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.410
where it's going to hit your
user, the end users

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.470
with cognitive overload
every single time.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.130
Make sure you're careful
how you're using components.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.980
Don't overload any single component,
and just consider carefully

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:43.216
how it might come across to end
users before you do too much.

00:24:58.364 --> 00:25:01.380
<v Nikole> Sometimes I get
some pushback from clients,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.580
like they want a specific thing
that is not good for accessibility,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:12.150
or they're asking me to do something
that may not be the best idea.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.550
I do recognize that in the
end, they are the customer

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.390
and I can provide them
with the strong arguments,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.390
but I can't always win those.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:27.290
I can move into the compromise phase,
like how can I get the end result

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.140
that I want quality,
the client have what they want.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.030
Say they want a site builder,
can you build training

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.610
or documentation materials
into your handoff process

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.100
to get them some best practices?

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.320
If they want functionality
that is not friendly to all,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.750
can you build alternatives into
your scope and pricing structure

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.090
so that you are giving
a complete package

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.040
whether or not they asked for it?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.280
If you can talk them into certain
functionality by pointing out facts

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.180
of the potential problems created
by ignoring accessibility,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.240
or show them additional benefits
maybe, like for example,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.730
this piece helps both accessibility
and mobile users navigate your site,

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.430
which represents whatever
percentage of your traffic.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.870
That might be a good
convincing argument for them.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.960
<v Annie> I always like to also--
We've got the carrots in like,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.430
this will bring more traffic,
this could be really good in this way

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:38.420
and this way, this sometimes we do
also have to hit with a stick of it.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.600
One of the ones I like
to start with is guilt.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.560
That's if they're being
really resistant to something

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.300
that's a particularly important
accessibility support.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.600
If they really want to
use this one component

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.380
that they have found somewhere from
another vendor and they're like,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.900
"This is so cool," but it's
they're not keyboard accessible,

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.370
and then they keep at it,
you start by asking them,

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.920
so what users are you
comfortable excluding here?

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.240
Are there people that you don't
want to be able to use your site?

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.660
Getting into that,
it's an empathy exercise,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.430
but also just making them
understand how people are going

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:28.170
to want to use the site,
need to use the site, you don't want

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.060
to exclude users.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.160
Usually, if you ask a client,
who are you comfortable blocking off

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.360
from your site so that they
can't be here, they can't use it,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.750
they can't look at your product,
they can't look at your content?

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.500
Often they'll startle and go, wait,
I don't want to block anybody,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.670
because why would you
want to block anybody?

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.270
Having them start to understand
how many people actually

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.830
do have disabilities, at any one
given time it's something like 26%

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.170
of the US population has a
disability, whether it's permanent

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.040
or temporary or situational.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.390
If you can make them understand that
having accessibility barriers means

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.930
that actual, real people who are
just trying to do whatever it is

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.890
that's being offered on the site,
trying to access this service,

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.620
trying to access this product,
trying to access this content,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.020
they just want to be able
to do the same thing,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.215
if you can get your
clients to understand

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:29.620
that they are putting a barrier

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.550
in the way of somebody
that can often help a lot.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.730
Because nobody really wants
to cut anybody out that way.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.050
There is also, of course,
the final big stick of,

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.610
somebody might get mad and sue
you, but apparently

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.620
from the studies that have been done
recently, that doesn't have nearly

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.980
as much of a positive effect
as just reminding them, yes,

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.950
people want to use your site
and they won't be able to

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.220
if you do this thing.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.940
Reminding them of the real people,
the real end users who are going

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.420
to want to use their site
and who could be blocked

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.570
from using it is really
always a great approach

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.320
to use because accessibility
support isn't special.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.820
It shouldn't be seen as something
special because the people

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.470
who need the accessibility supports
are just trying to live their lives

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.050
and do the same things
as everybody else.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.040
<v Nikole> I do get a little
pushback sometimes from designers

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:41.040
because as a developer, I want
to make things that are flexible

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.550
and responsive.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.550
If someone wants to put in
their own user style sheet

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.190
and they want to adjust the
fonts on there, and they want

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.210
to change them, and they want to
change colors, I'm totally okay

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.170
with all of that.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:59.990
This is their artwork,
but it's also a consumable art

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.280
that is dictated by
company policies.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:09.450
If you work together as a company
to build in the requirements,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.490
like favoring these flexible,
responsive designs over perfect,

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:18.890
or you build in certain requirements
about buttons or spacing

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.850
or menus, or things like
that, you can serve everyone

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.200
on every device better.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.580
If everyone can learn to,
as a company, like I said,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.440
just make a compromise,
then they can work together

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.299
and get some of the stuff done.

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:52.200
I did put up a resource list and
code snippets in the github repo

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.320
If anyone wants to go
look at those things,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.790
we'll sure have the link
available for you too.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:30:59.790
Thanks.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.890
Those are our contact information
if you want to find us.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.970
I do apologize if anything that
I was saying is not very clear,

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.600
because still struggling
with the braces.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.550
If there was anything not clear,
please feel free to find me later

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.550
and ask me.

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:24.730
<v Annie> Looks
like we do have Q&amp;A.

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:28.987
<v Danielle> All right.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.980
I just want to take a second
to thank you both so much

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.320
for your presentation.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.110
As a reminder, you can enter your
questions in the Slido Q&amp;A tab.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.200
We do have a few questions
that have come in.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.063
The first one,
we'll get your perspective on

00:31:52.064 --> 00:31:54.380
and see if you know anything about.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:02.500
The question is, how do you handle
site maps for very large websites?

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.240
Sometimes I've seen site maps
that are just giant alphabetical

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.000
or date-ordered lists.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.200
How do you guys handle those?

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:13.040
<v Annie> Nikole,
do you have anything?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.270
Because I've got one I can
probably pop, good example.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:17.969
<v Nikole> Go ahead.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.060
<v Annie> Okay.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.650
One of the things that
we worked on recently

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.410
at Cornell is the
university newspaper.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.450
As you can guess, there's
tons of articles all the time.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.630
We don't have a site map that
has every single article.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:44.650
Instead, what the site map does is
it organizes things by category.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:49.390
The site map, there are certain
tags that articles will have,

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:56.020
and every single article that gets
put up will have one or more tags

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.020
on it.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.970
The site map does tags,
it has those tags that are used

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.800
to categorize the articles.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.890
If you click on one of those
tags, it'll take you to a list

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.680
of all of the articles
that have that tag.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.960
When you have that,
you combine it with a site search,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.710
and that gives you the way
to satisfy the multiple ways

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.460
requirement without, again,
serious cognitive overload

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.940
because you're smacking your end
users with everything all at once,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.570
because yes, sure enough
medical date-ordered lists are--

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.140
They're technically
accessible, I don't think.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.500
WCAG doesn't have anything
that says they're a failure.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.820
They're just cognitive overload.

00:33:42.817 --> 00:33:47.160
<v Danielle> Do you have
a user style sheet thing

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.390
and then an XML version
for search engines,

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.310
or do you just use the one and
it just links the categories?

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.500
<v Annie> I am not sure.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.400
I would have to go
ask our design team.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.540
<v Danielle> I'm always curious about
how people handle their site maps

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.160
as well.

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:06.850
<v Annie> I've gotten too far out
of the actual day-to-day work.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.050
I know that they have the things
that they've built to do this

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.640
and do it right, and do it
accessibly, but I don't know exactly

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.370
how they would.

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:17.890
<v Nikole> I would definitely
say that kind of stuff begins

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:25.210
with a content strategy because
if your site maps are just a bunch

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.790
of giant stuff dumped there,
you probably haven't thought out

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.020
through content strategy very
well to categorize and tag,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.210
and whatever else those things.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.340
There's probably better
ways of breaking up content,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.190
and that's leaving an
accessibility thing.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.060
It's like an every problem.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.960
Because if you haven't broken your
content in a way that it's easy

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.592
for people to digest, then you
probably have a bigger problem

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:56.820
with the thing.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:59.530
<v Danielle> Totally.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.010
That definitely makes some sense.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.020
The next question
here that we have.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.190
When you're building from an
accessibility-first perspective,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.890
are there certain themes
or plugins that are part

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.820
of your default starter theme,
or do you just build everything

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820
from scratch?

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.619
<v Nikole> No.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:32.070
The two things I built out
recently, one was using WP Rig,

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:37.140
which is like you know, you start with your
base thing and then you can add

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.460
in all your accessibility for
your menus and the footers,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.660
and add functions in it.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.910
Then it just becomes
a build process.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.590
Say I have the rig set
up and it's customized

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.520
for whatever the
company's doing with it.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:57.820
Then I can add in specific things
that one site needs, run the build,

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.900
it makes the theme.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.500
Then I can switch out those
components for a different site,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.900
like add in new components,
run the build, it makes the theme.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.840
It's like a little factory
blueprint that way.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.600
The other thing that I've been doing
a lot of stuff with lately is Gatsby.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.500
Gatsby has a lot of
accessibility supports built in.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.260
You make your WordPress site.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.710
You make your little Gatsby site,
it pulls it all out and it makes

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.530
into a static site.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.380
It has all these little
supports that are built in

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.520
so you can make the process
and then you can keep

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.830
on replicating that
process for new sites.

00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Danielle> Cool.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.160
Makes sense.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.730
Just to double back
real quick on site maps,

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.090
we got another
question in for that.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.660
They are often in the
footer of a website.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.870
Should it be visually located
somewhere else or does it make sense

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.430
that it's always in the footer?

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.070
<v Annie> I would not put an
entire site map in the footer.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.450
It's like you wouldn't want to have
the entire site map in the main nav.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.320
Anything that somebody's going
to have to go all the way through

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.710
to get to other stuff,
and footers count for this

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.570
because there's often stuff
at the very end of the page

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.620
that people would want to get to like
terms, privacy, things like that.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.450
If you don't have a giant
site, sure you could have

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:20.410
all the page links there,
but if you've got a big site,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.690
you'll want to have the
site map be a separate page.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.160
You can link to that
from the footer.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.810
That's completely personal.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.350
<v Nikole> Would you put
it somewhere else too?

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.380
I think I would actually put--
if I was trying to do something

00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:35.253
to make it most accessible,

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:39.100
especially if I had a
mobile menu situation

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.030
where you could just drop down
the thing, I'd probably put it

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.530
at the end of the menu too,
so that you could hit it

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.010
from the top and the bottom.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.810
It's not in the way of
anything, but it's nice if I'm--

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.960
I don't really want to make someone
have to go through an entire page

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.720
to find the site map, and I don't
want to have to make them click

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.900
through 75 things to
find the site map.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:04.920
Making it from the dropdown
menu or from the footer is fine.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Annie> Again, multiple ways
requirements, so they're nice.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.190
You put in the main menu
and then in the footer too.

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:12.991
Different spots you
can get to it from.

00:38:14.415 --> 00:38:15.799
<v Danielle> Awesome.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.920
Totally, that makes sense.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.160
It's hard because you don't
want to break patterns too much

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.030
because people come to
expect certain things,

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.530
but then there are pattern
breakers and rule breakers,

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.940
and that tends to
set up new trends.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.160
Maybe we're developing a whole new
trend here by putting site maps

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.830
into the mobile
menus in the header.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.660
I like it.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.984
If we move on to
when you were talking

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:43.170
about designers seeing their work

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:48.050
as art, what are your strategies
for working with them who see it

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.120
as art rather than a way
of sharing information?

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.330
Do you have specific scripts
that you fall back on,

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.800
or other strategies that you use?

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:02.310
<v Nikole> That really needs
to be a company decision.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.620
It can't come from the
developers because no one goes

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.620
to the developers anyways.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.690
That needs to be a
top-down decision.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:14.590
We've put people first,
then we need to put people first

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.930
as a company decision thing.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:23.990
That would trickle down to
everybody of how they see things.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:31.250
I think a lot of companies that will
invest in UX designers will tend

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.510
to have more interest in how
people are experiencing the site.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.430
Looking for companies that
are doing user experience more

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:46.190
than we make pretty stuff,
is definitely important.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:50.840
I definitely think that like I
said, no one goes to the developer.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.520
It needs to be a top-down
thing from the product managers

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.340
or down from the CEO.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.610
It just has to go all the
way down from the top,

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.380
and be a company decision.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Annie> It's also a place where
the very mean accessibility people

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.660
can come in.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.570
If we have to use the stick
of, no, we're not allowed

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.430
to do this because accessibility,
it'll sometimes raise some hackles,

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.550
but it can get through.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.660
The "who are you willing to exclude"
approach can also work there.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.220
It's, okay, this is your art,
but are you really wanting

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.860
to put a barrier in that
will keep some people from

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.670
being able to use this?

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.650
If you've got this really
complex line design

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.690
that's got some neat depth
perception stuff, are you really okay

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.450
with the fact that some people
will look at this and get dizzy,

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.240
and not be able to go
further into the site?

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.040
There's also the design challenge.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:53.130
Are you the kind of designer who
can't rise to the design challenge

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.130
of making attractive
but accessible design?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.320
I think we can use the same
stick on developers too.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.050
This is a challenge for you,
and if you're a good designer

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.530
and a good developer, you should
be able to make this work.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.320
I know you can do this.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.060
<v Danielle> I love that approach

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Annie> You can try it
a little bit going there,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.610
and that can work
in your favor a bit.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.234
<v Danielle> Challenging
their intellect

00:41:18.235 --> 00:41:20.090
and they'll prove you wrong.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.590
I love it.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.170
This is another
question that came in.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.590
It feels a lot to me that custom
blocks are really the future

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.560
for making components the most
user-friendly and accessible.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.460
Has your experience
at Cornell found this?

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.270
I would add onto that the
idea that they literally

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.460
just launched the block-locking
features and things like that.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.440
Does that make you skew
towards custom blocks

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.444
or do you still stick with ACF?

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:54.720
How do you approach that?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.480
<v Nikole> I would say
that yes the block stuff in

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.800
in WordPress 6.1 is
going to be huge.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:07.140
As a developer, it's both
fascinating and it's also scary,

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.860
because it's like,
you can now full site editor.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.450
I'm like, "Oh no, oh no.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.230
Look what they're doing now."

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:24.100
I don't think ACF is
against the blocks.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.390
I actually think it would work
with it, and I think they're about

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.770
to update all their stuff to
work with WordPress 6.1.2.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:36.050
I've been using the nightly
build or whatever of WordPress

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.690
for a little while to play with
it and it's working really great.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.640
I don't think it's against
it, but I definitely think

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.750
that we're going to see-- I
think that WordPress is starting

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.320
to learn from the rest of
the development community,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.800
and they're starting
to learn components

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.515
and things like that that
other languages have been doing

00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:53.420
for a while.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.610
Definitely, it's going to be
what we're going to be doing.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.760
I do think that ACF or a tool like
that makes it a little bit easier

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.120
for the rest of the team,
because they can just build stuff out

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.160
the way they want it.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.960
Then the developer consistent
export the JSON file,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.480
and then they can put it the--
that just makes it easier

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.440
rather than making it like,
you got to give me a list

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.750
of the things that you
want on the content page.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.540
That makes those processes easier.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.690
For a workflow thing,
it might be easier,

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.700
but definitely everything's
going to be about blocks

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:36.280
and how to make custom blocks,
and how to just make that easier.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.630
I'm still trying to work
out how it's going to work

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:39.560
with a full site editor.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.190
That's going to be a
little bit scary and weird.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Danielle> It sounds like
the answer is it depends

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:49.110
on the requirements of
the project as always.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.810
<v Nikole> No,
it's going to go much--

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.130
if you're not already doing custom
blocks, it's going to be the thing

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.710
that everybody's
going to be doing now.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.220
They're just going to be selling
custom blocks as a service thing.

00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:06.799
<v Annie> Our custom development
team at Cornell does,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.910
we do custom components and have
a demo site where it's like,

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.820
you can have this,
you can have this.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.340
They've got things that
our clients can go look at

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.950
and they can make a choice
about what it is they want

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:24.410
to include on their site,
and we'll do minimal modifications

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.710
because they've already
made them accessible.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:32.690
It helps a lot, at least for the
parts of the university that come

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.670
to us for their sites,
which is not everybody,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.470
universities being
decentralized as they are.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:43.130
<v Danielle> Speaking of that,
we have one last question.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.140
How does Cornell handle enforcing
accessibility standards?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.020
Is there a review team before
a new website can go live?

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.123
How does that work?

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:55.059
<v Annie> That is difficult.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.150
Universities are
really decentralized.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.510
This is probably one of the most
challenging parts of my position

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:10.070
because I'm basically the top
dedicated web accessibility person

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:15.800
at Cornell, and so I'm the person
everybody's supposed to come to,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:21.600
web accessibility information and
things, but I don't have a lot

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.800
of enforcement mechanisms.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.610
We have a policy, an official policy
that says everything is supposed

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:35.910
to meet WCAG 2.1 level AA as a
baseline, but they don't have

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.960
to go through the custom development
team that I'm housed under

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.780
in our central IT.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.260
They don't have to use us
to build their websites.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.470
They can hire an outside
vendor to build a website,

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:55.100
because we have literally thousands
of websites at the university,

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.680
thousands of different properties.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.780
We have some core university
websites that get checked

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.790
on a regular basis anywhere from
once a year to every 18 months or so,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.350
that my team does an accessibility
review of those sites

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:15.660
as often as we can manage it.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.080
If the site's not covered under
that set of core university sites,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:25.060
it is the responsibility of
the unit that owns the site,

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.010
like the particular
college that owns the site.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:31.070
It's their responsibility to make
sure that it stays up to date,

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:35.920
stays accessible,
doesn't have problems.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.660
Ideally, yes, there is a
review before it goes live, and

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.020
that's one of the services that
we try to make sure everybody

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.620
at the university is aware of.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.270
Realistically, it doesn't
always happen because there is

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.550
just so much activity going on.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.230
It's hard.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:01.250
That and vended products is my
other bug bear, because I deal

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.020
with a lot vended products.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.960
We try to make sure that everybody
gets some accessibility review.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.370
Everybody is responsible
for keeping them up to date

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:16.290
and at least at WCAG baseline,
but when there's so much of it,

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.750
it's really, really hard.

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:22.550
<v Danielle> Do you have
any resources that you give

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:26.800
to people in regards to that
where if they say, "You're going

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.247
with someone else, make sure they do
this" to at least make it easier?

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:31.250
<v Annie> Yes.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.110
We do have a university-wide
site improve subscription

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:37.060
so that they can do at least
the basic automated checks

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.910
because that's a pretty good job
of catching what you can catch

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:40.910
with automated stuff.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.240
We have a WCAG checklist
that we developed

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.520
for the accessibility teams
use, but that we make available

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.740
to the rest of the university
along with an explanation

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.790
of how to test everything.

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:55.480
There's that.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.820
Then trainings, offering
trainings every single month on

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.560
how to do testing basically.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.630
Automated tools, manual testing.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:11.530
I get at least a half dozen people
in each of those every month.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.390
They're interested.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.010
Everybody wants to do it and they're
taking advantage of the resources.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.340
<v Danielle> That's encouraging.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.710
<v Annie> Make it
everybody's responsibility,

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.540
and then make sure they can get
the information they need to do it.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.703
It's really the way to go.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.360
<v Danielle> Awesome.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.180
That's awesome and super
helpful perspectives on small

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.470
and large teams, and all of that.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.350
I just want to say thank
you again both of you

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:42.440
for having an extra long
Q&amp;A so that we can ask you

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.200
some of these very
important questions.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:51.800
