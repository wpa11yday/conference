WEBVTT

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Host> Getting Started with
Accessibility, presented by,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.550
Gregory Hammond, who is a website
consultant at Gregory J Development.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.190
There will be no Q&amp;A during
this lightning round,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.600
but please use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.030
Gregory is here in
the chat and in Slack

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.190
and can answer your
questions there.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.580
So, take it away Greg.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.599
<v Gregory Hammond> Why
is a speaker going to talk

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.390
in WordPress Accessibility Day?

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.390
It's because it's great to have
a refresher for those who make it

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.720
to themselves to be experts.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.130
If you are a beginner,
then it's great to know

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.960
what the very, very,
very beginning steps should be

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.670
and if you're somewhere in
between, don't worry,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.500
you will learn something
from this talk.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.980
All the slides I am showing are
available for viewing and downloading

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.650
at your own convenience.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.760
The link for that
is bit.ly/wpad2022.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.040
If you post on Twitter about
this talk or this conference,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.810
you are welcome to tag me.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080
I'm @DevGregory.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.274
That is D-E-V-G-R-E-G-O-R-Y.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.730
Let's get started with why
accessibility is so important.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.440
I'm sure it's been covered in
this conference already a ton;

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.430
however, it's great to remember that
one in every four people identify

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.810
as having a disability.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.830
That disability could be something
that's visible or something

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.350
that's completely invisible.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.140
You may know someone who has
disability and they proudly say,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.690
Yes, I have a disability,
or you may think, Oh,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.380
I don't have somebody who has a
disability but, they, themselves,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.870
think they do. Accessibility is
so important because, it shows

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.020
that you care about everyone
and you want them to be able

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.150
to access what you have to offer.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.080
If you don't include accessibility,
you could not include 25%

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.140
of your potential audience.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.680
That may not seem like a lot, but
it's 25% could make a big difference.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.780
Since this is a WordPress
Conference, you want

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.320
to make sure choose a theme
that is accessibility ready.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.060
If you choose one from WordPress.org,
it makes it so much easier

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.340
to find these accessibility themes.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.500
If you go to WordPress.org
for such themes,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.780
you can choose a picture filter
where you can go under the features

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.140
and select accessibility ready. When
you search through those filters,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.380
you will see about at this
time 100 different themes.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.740
That may not seem like
very many compared

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.010
to how many themes are available,
but there's 100 different themes

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.010
you can choose from.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.450
You may be thinking,
What makes a theme, quote unquote,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.120
accessibility ready? According to
the WordPress Theme Review Handbook,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.840
it must include at
least the following:

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.700
One, make sure someone only using
a keyboard can use the website.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.620
Number two, make sure anyone who
uses screen reader can identify:

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.020
What is a bun?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.030
What is a link, and what is
something for them to fill in?

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.660
Number three,
make sure it includes a skip link

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.850
so that the screen readers can
skip the menu of the website.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.550
Now that it's your theme, you want
to start thinking about headings

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.350
and paragraphs.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.400
H1, known as header one,
should be used once per page.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.220
It is used to identify
what the page is about.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.390
This allows the site to be organized
and makes it easier for everyone

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.340
to understand what is important
and what is also important

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340
on the website.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.420
Something we should all consider
is what language is on the website.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.050
I'm not talking about
English or French here,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.390
but the wording is something
that you want those

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.920
who read the website to understand.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.930
You can think about
it as how technical

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.730
or non-technical do you
want the site to be.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.800
For example, since this is a
talk for beginners, I'm trying

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.450
to use simple and plain language,
so everyone can understand

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.630
what I’m saying.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.290
If you have a site that's meant for
beginners or meant for everyone,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.520
consider using plain language.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.640
What is often on every
website is images.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.080
This can be great to break up
all of that text on the website;

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.680
however, you want to make sure
that those images are accessible.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.190
That means add something
called alt text to the images.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.160
Alt text is used to describe the
image to someone who can't see it.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.930
It can be hard to write
alt text at first.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.580
One suggestion I have, is close
your eyes and try to remember

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.920
what is the point in that image
and write your text around that.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.220
You get better
writing it over time.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.500
Every single website
also has color.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.050
Color could just be black and
white, or you can add many,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.390
many colors to it; however,
you want everything on your site

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.200
to be [unintelligible]

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
by everyone.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.437
To ensure this,
want to have a contrast

00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:44.880
between the different wording
on the website.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.390
The very minimum you want is
3:1 for large text and 4.5:1

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.980
for paragraph text.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.460
As always for accessibility,
the higher the number the better.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.050
Now you may be thinking, What is this
color contrast I’m talking about?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.690
The simplest definition I have
found is quote, a measurement

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.770
of the difference if you see a
brightness between two colors,

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:16.130
end quote.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.860
How do you check what the color
contrast is between your background

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.110
and the text you actually
have on the website?

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.680
My favorite website is
WebAIM’s Contrast Checker,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.000
but there are so many
other [unintelligible 7:34]

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.020
and websites which offer this,
so find one that suits you best.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.020
There are also a million different
fonts to choose from; however,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.850
when we think about accessibility,
you have to be careful

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.230
with which font you choose.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.810
I want you to think for a moment
about which fonts you have seen

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.310
on websites and are
they accessible or not?

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:11.060
Got some themes got
some text in your head?

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.670
You think about, OK,
what's accessible and what's not?

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.080
You're probably hoping that
I can just list off a number

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.520
of different fonts for you to choose
with themes to choose or whatever.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.250
There isn't one or two or five
that could be considered the best.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.860
While many sites offer different
suggestions, I would encourage you

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.360
that find some that fit you and your
website or your business the best.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.080
You, also, for fonts,
you want to limit the number

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.930
of different fonts you use.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.070
Try to limit that to three or less.

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:52.230
With it now being easy to read
and I think that's assessable,

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:57.020
you want to make sure there's enough
space in the text on the side,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.710
between the letters
and the paragraphs.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:05.010
That way the reader can know if the
border is [unintelligible 9:04].

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.670
You want to make sure the font is
also big enough for somebody to read.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:20.700
The general suggestion is to start
at 16 pixels and work your way up.

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:27.440
You also may be reading text at
100% zoom or the regular zoom;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.650
however, there are people who
increase that font for many, many,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.470
many reasons.

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:37.390
You want to ensure that
your font can still be read

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.470
and you’re wording
at 200% zoomed in.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.880
This is because you
want to make sure

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.780
that the text doesn’t lose
any content or functionality.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.180
Many websites love to
include audio or video

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.860
and while they can look great, they
can be an accessibility nightmare.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.610
Yeah, they seriously can.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:13.560
Make sure nothing plays unless the
person viewing the website wants it

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.000
to play.

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:19.910
If you include audio or
video, then make sure

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:26.993
to include Closed Captions or
describe what is happening.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.500
Have you ever been to many
websites and thought, Wow,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.800
all of those links look very
similar across [unintelligible]

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.328
websites?

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:36.180
Why is that?

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:41.900
Because general suggestion is
to distinguish, what is a link

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.020
and what isn't?

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.840
The most common way to do this
is have a link be blue in color

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.550
and have it be underlined.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:56.380
Now it stands out, and the person
on the website knows what is a link

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.360
and what isn't.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.700
If you set it blue text color,
don't use blue as the link,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.500
use a different color.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:11.510
Another way to make sure your links
are accessible is by describing

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.210
what they do.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.240
Don't use the words,
Learn more or click here.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.720
Use something like,
You can rent a tour or learn more

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.070
about our favorite past time .

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:30.190
It helps differentiate with
the different things are.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:36.290
Accessibility is also
making sure anyone

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.080
in the world can visit the
website in the first place.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.960
This means making your website
load as quickly as possible.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:51.900
The best practice now seems
to be three seconds or less.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.180
If you're unsure how quickly or
how slowly your website loads,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.000
there are many websites
[unintelligible]

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.280
that you test that.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.980
My personal favorite
is webpagetest.org.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.470
Of course,
the length of time also depends on

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.490
where pn the website is located
and the visitor is located.

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:19.320
Accessibility also means
making sure the site looks good

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.490
on the computer as well as a
mobile device, like a phone.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.790
Have you tested how your
site looks on a phone?

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:33.540
Maybe not, because you could
be losing an additional 30%

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.550
of your potential customers
if it doesn't look good.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.460
That is more customers.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.760
I know I have talked a ton,
and I included so much information.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.410
What you have to remember is
what may work for one person,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.780
may not work for somebody else.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.420
This is not meant to be an
end-all and a perfect guide

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.540
for making your website
100% accessible.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.320
It's a guide to make your
website more accessible.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.070
If you want to see
how your website looks

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.370
against some
accessibility standards,

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:19.460
then do a mini website accessibility
evaluation tour like Web IM’s over

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.429
at wave.webAIM.org.

00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:26.230
To close,
there can be a ton that can be done

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.660
to make a website accessible, and
I've just only covered the surface

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.480
of the stuff.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.583
Like theme, heading,
language, images,

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:44.580
color, fonts, audio and video,
and links just to name a few.

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:49.230
If you missed anything that I talked
about, my slides are available

your own pleasure and convenience

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.930
I would also like to
thank the organizing team

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.630
at WordPress Accessibility Day
for everything they have done

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.060
that you may see or
may not have seen.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.900
If you have any questions
about what I talked about,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.440
the most convenient for way for
me to contact me through any

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.580
of the links like my e-mail
address or my social media

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.180
that are available on my website.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.668
My website is gegoryhammond.ca.

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.863
Now, call to action, get out there

00:14:31.863 --> 00:14:35.627
and make your website
more accessible.
