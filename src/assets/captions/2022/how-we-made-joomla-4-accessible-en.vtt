00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:30.364
[silence]

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:30.915
<v Kim Coleman> Welcome back

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.211
to WordPress Accessibility
Day, everyone.

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:36.880
I'm Kim Coleman, and I'm excited
to announce our next session,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.390
my last session as your host,
How we made Joomla 4 accessible.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.730
Presented by Carlos Camara.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.380
Carlos is a web developer that
specializes in Joomla, PrestaShop,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.350
WordPress, and Laravel.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.600
Carlos has been involved in the
Joomla accessibility team since 2017

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.920
and was the team leader in 2020.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.520
As a developer, Carlos creates
custom solutions for Joomla,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.760
PrestaShop, and WordPress.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
He also maintains the Joomla
podcast, mastermindjoomla.com,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.370
and a PrestaShop
podcast, prestaradio.com.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
Please feel free like before
to add any questions for Carlos

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.130
in the Q&amp;A tab of the chat
area, and we'll answer them

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.630
at the end of this session.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.130
You can also use the Ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.985
Without further ado,
here we welcome Carlos Camara.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Carlos Camara> Thank you very
much for this great presentation.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.130
I think my camera just can't.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.680
Okay, oh, sorry.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Okay.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.070
How we made Joomla 4 accessible.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.970
I'm sorry, my camera just freeze.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.344
Let's go with my picture.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.140
Okay.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.160
A quick outline of what we are
going to see on this session.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.410
We are going to see a bit of
me, although Kim

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.050
just made a great presentation,
so that will be quick.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.110
We will also do a quick Joomla
intro, especially for knowing

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.690
what is the project and
some key concepts and works

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.340
that I think would be interesting.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.560
We'll see how accessibility
has been into Joomla project

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.070
since the beginning, but not so
easy to see it, but it's been there.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.890
We will see how we made it in
Joomla 4, where one of our flagship

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.680
in this release is
accessibility actually.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.050
Finally, the decisions we
have to make, and we will see

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.560
what's the future for Joomla.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.560
I would like to give a piece of
advice to this great community

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.970
of WordPress.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.460
About me, I speak PrestaShop,
Joomla, and a bit of WordPress.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.050
I actually been released a
plugin for a customer last week,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.050
a WordPress plugin, so I know
a little bit about WordPress,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.330
but just from a
developer point of view.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.450
I do not usually build
websites with WordPress.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.200
Anyway, I know how to move in
the WordPress administrator

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440
on some key concepts.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.990
I am not an accessibility
expert either, so I don't know

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.420
what I'm doing here,
as I am not a WordPress expert

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.540
and I am not an
accessibility expert.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.120
Anyway, I'm really interested
in a web for everyone.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.280
I guess that's why I am here.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.160
I have been involved in Joomla
governance in some higher spheres

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.070
like the board, the Joomla
board that make decisions,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.490
and also in more practical aspects
like the Joomla accessibility team.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.100
Finally, very important,
I am the human of two dogs,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.000
and I just became father of my
third kid, and also I like running.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.960
Maybe you may see me on
many marathons in your city.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.900
A little bit of Joomla
politics or Joomla history.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.890
Joomla is actually a fork.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.920
Joomla is a fork of content
management system called Mambo,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.410
which was really
popular at that point.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.740
It was developed by an
Australian company called Miro.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.970
They decided to stop doing it
open source and doing it propriety

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.920
or changing sometimes in the code.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.980
The core developers of Mambo decided
that it was not the way to go,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:14.930
and they created this fork
to have an open-source

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.860
content management system
because that's how they thought

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.970
the web should be.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.550
Personally, that move was
well, and they even got a name,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.410
which is the Swahili word Jumla,
which means "all together"

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.810
or "as a whole", it depends on
where you look for the translation.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.500
I do not speak Swahili,
so I cannot tell you for sure.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.910
Anyway, to create this
or to make this happen,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.317
they created a
non-profit organization

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.750
called Open Source Matters.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.010
This is the legal entity that covers
Joomla in the financial aspects.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:08.200
It protects the Joomla copyright, and
also they made some high decisions

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.510
about the structure,
how the project should be doing.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.920
The board of Open Source Matters
is four by four, is formed

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.880
by four elected members, president,
vice president, treasurer,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:31.170
and secretary, and all the
working department leaders

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.900
of the different working
structure of Joomla.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.470
We have different
departments for events.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.760
We have a department for production,
that is mainly the core of the code.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.160
We have a department for marketing.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.720
We have several departments.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.950
Okay.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.360
Then every leader of
these departments,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.780
from the Open Source Matters board.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.390
Also, the departments are
splitted or are divided in teams.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.500
For instance, the Joomla
accessibility team is part

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.390
of the production department.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.590
A little bit of Joomla wants.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.550
What you can see here
if you have a screen

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.840
or you can see my slides,
is the Joomla backend

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.570
because in Joomla we have
two different applications.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.980
We have the Joomla administrator,
which is what they called backend,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.420
and it's independent from
what visitors of the site see,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.080
that is the Joomla front.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.600
We call it front.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.600
In this talk, I will try to
name Joomla administrator,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.610
but at some point, I might say
Joomla backend, so sorry for that.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.610
In Joomla,
we also have plugins and widgets.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.590
We call plugins, plugins, but for
widgets, we use the word modules.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.220
We also have themes.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.250
For themes we use the word templates,
but basically it's the same.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.980
In Joomla,
we have a concept which is override.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:33.390
It's a very
programming-minded concept.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.700
It means that no matter what a
plugin gives you in the front end,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.890
in the view, you can change it using
a specific path to put your changes,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.980
and then it change the output.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.070
You can replace what the developer
have in mind with your own code,

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.020
and it will work.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.210
It's just for aesthetics.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.580
It's just for the structure,
VH domain structure, and the CSS

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:09.750
of what people see.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.350
Joomla is also fully featured
with interesting extensions.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.380
The Joomla code has
probably everything you need

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.320
to create a website,
a corporate website

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.780
with no third-party extensions,
no third-party plugins.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.200
Just with Joomla,
you can develop a great website.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.260
We actually had last month,
a challenge in our marquee,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.470
which was how to build a
website just using Joomla code,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.930
without any third-party plugins.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.750
It's something you can do and you can
do great things just using Joomla,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.820
what Joomla provides.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:08.840
Anyway, even so, we also have
components or different extensions,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.200
components, libraries, plugins.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.260
We have third parties and other
developers that provide plugins

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.480
to Joomla to make it rich.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.610
Since the beginning, Joomla
has had accessibility in mind.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.890
Actually, I was surprised when
I started learning about this

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.290
because I have been involved in
Joomla, have been using Joomla

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.410
since Mambo times, but when you
were not aware of accessibility

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:46.890
or all the aspects, you do not
pay that much attention to them.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:53.140
Actually, when Joomla splitted from
Mambo, when Joomla was started,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.810
it was basically Mambo
code and it was Joomla 1.0

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.970
and there was not that much
accessibility features.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.800
Just the ones that
were in core Mambo.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:13.160
The first release, you can consider
a Joomla, 100% Joomla, more or less.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:20.500
Is the Joomla 1.5 release and that
release in the Joomla framework,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.470
another aspect of Joomla.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:30.850
It also came with one template,
one theme called Beez.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:43.030
This theme was a fully
accessible theme.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.190
It also came with a
couple of extra themes,

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.490
but this one is interesting because
it was a fully accessible theme

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.150
by the standards we
had at that moment.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.550
Interesting features it had.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.550
It provided a font size selector.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.400
It had very good contrast.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:12.880
At that point Joomla 1.5, 2008,
Joomla was showing all the code

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.340
or creating HTML code still
with some tables in it.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.870
Our team developers were still
showing tables to a structure

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:29.140
to lay out the content,
but the Beez theme had no tables.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.090
It was a fully or very
nice great template.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:42.070
In my opinion,
Beez has one problem that made it,

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.870
not everyone like it
or not everyone use it.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.250
It was a very student design.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:53.780
It was a very pinky, very violent
purple theme with some bees

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.040
that were very nice than cartoons.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.220
That makes people thought, this is
not a serious option for my website.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.810
Especially, it was a time where
everyone wanted a corporate website

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.710
that was great to sell or to
tell how good your company was.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.970
This was not the best template
for that because of this design

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.370
that made some people thought
it was not a serious proposal.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:30.700
Anyway, those developers who were
aware of the accessibility features

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:36.670
in Beez who really had access
reading mind when developing website

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:41.150
still kept using it.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:48.294
I can tell you that one of
the judicial systems website

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.613
in Australia,
I don't remember exactly

00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:55.960
which ones had
exactly this template,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.350
this theme installed.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.920
You could recognize some of
the layouts on the features,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.700
but obviously, it has a more
server option for columns,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.690
that was so pinky.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:17.030
It was interesting in that
sense, so people could use it

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.540
even though it was so sustained.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.440
One interesting thing about
this team is, it was blacked

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.960
with overrides like it over-ridded
everything to make it accessible.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.290
It was also a good experiment
for theme developers

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.940
to create their own
versions of software.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:46.790
Anyway, as I mentioned, it was not
the most popular theme for Joomla.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.500
After Joomla 1.5,
we got Joomla 2.5 and Joomla 3,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.070
and those two releases came
with Beez 2 and Beez 3.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.563
These Beez themes
still were accessible,

00:15:00.563 --> 00:15:08.107
still were a nice templates, nice
themes in the sense of accessibility,

00:15:08.587 --> 00:15:11.900
but they were more boring.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.510
They abandoned the pinky theme,
the pink colors, the string colors,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.670
and it they made them more sober.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:30.210
Anyway, they were at that
point, really had

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:36.450
a really strong internal efforts in
Joomla to be compliant with ATAG 2.0.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:46.080
Some people in the UX team, like
Angie Radtke, which was a developer

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.180
of the big templates, were
really pushing for accessibility.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.270
One thing I have to mention
about Joomla historically is that

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.890
even though it was an open-source
system since the beginning,

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:08.560
and actually the reason
we have Joomla today is

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.010
because the developers really
wanted it to be open-source.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.670
Historically, it's not being
easy to send changes to Joomla.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:24.060
People who have tried or who
tried contributing the early 2000

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:30.760
at the beginning of the
century, were not very welcome

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.090
to make changes to the code.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.000
Only the code team in Joomla were
able to make changes to the CMS.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.430
We're still using SVN.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.020
It was not easy.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.690
We had some communications, you
could propose changes, but you have

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.000
to send them by email.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.460
It was not like a very good way
of getting new contributions

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.110
to the project.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:09.460
There were in a case some changes
in the project and at some point,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.930
they decided to change that.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.480
We moved to GitHub.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:23.050
Now everyone, every user of the
internet, can submit approve requests

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.850
and if it's good enough or it has
no problems, it solves an issue

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.240
and it's tested correctly,
it can be incorporated into Joomla.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.230
There's no issue for that.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:44.160
Right now, the Joomla production
team keeps checking all the code

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.690
that is submitted into
Joomla, but it's much easier

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:54.660
to get your changes
into the project.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.740
Also, this came with lots
of changes in the project.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:09.021
We have lots of politics,
political changes.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.000
At some point,
we started to think about Joomla 4.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.940
I say, at some point, because Joomla
4 has been in development since 2013.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.540
This has been huge.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.720
I mean, it's been like more than
eight years working in Joomla 4.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:48.540
It means that lots of things you
plant in 2013 did not even make it

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.540
to 2016.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:56.000
It's like, the standard changes,
you know how the [inaudible]

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
is.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:03.620
It's like, everything was moved
and we changed lots of things.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.480
We made different
template, different themes.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.710
We made lots of change.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:17.050
In all this process since
2013, we changed the structure,

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.680
the political structure in Joomla.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.728
We established the Joomla
accessibility theme was created

00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:27.500
in 2016.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:36.050
Since 2005 to 2016, we did not
have any accessibility theme

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:41.600
or anyone in charge of checking
accessibility into the project.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.440
We only had volunteers who
wanted it to be accessible

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.940
but we didn't have an accessibility
team or a team dedicated

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.940
to accessibility.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:03.080
Since 2016 till 2019, the new
created accessibility team made

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.150
a huge effort in generating lots
of documentation and raising issues

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.920
for the new themes we were developing
for Joomla 4 and participating

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.760
in some decisions we made.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.570
Before talking about hard decisions
we made, I forgot to mention

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.560
in the introduction that Joomla had
several themes for the front end,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.680
and one of them was Beez.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.650
We have talked a lot about Beez.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.700
For the back-end, for Joomla
administrator, we also have themes

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.650
and we have the history gallery.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.290
We have had at least two themes
for the Joomla administrator.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.680
One is the default one,
which was not created or developed

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.250
with accessibility in mind.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:05.480
The other one, which was a
simplified version of the first one,

00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:15.972
which was not fully accessible, but
we like it to think it was accessible

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.080
because it was simpler.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.410
Anyway, it was like
what we thought we had

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.250
or why we had that
theme in Joomla 4.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.970
In Joomla 4, we did some decisions,
which some of them were harder

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:38.190
because it meant to put lots of
people in the same direction,

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.110
but I think we were
the correct one.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.900
First of all,
we do not need an accessible theme.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.300
We do not need an accessible theme
for the Joomla administrator,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.480
and we do not need an accessible
theme for the public path

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.920
or as a default theme.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:06.630
We need the one administrator
theme we release

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.220
and the one front-end theme
we released at accessible.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:16.200
We did not need two themes,
so people can choose if they want

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.130
to be accessible or if they
like the other designs.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.900
We need everything that is developed
in Joomla to be accessible.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.660
That was the first decision.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.520
We worked through having just
one theme for the back end

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.727
and one theme for the front end, and
both of them have got accessibility.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:51.990
Both administrator and front-end
themes are right now accessible.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:59.360
We made them compliant
with the WCAG 2.1 level AA.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:10.600
We made it making designers
UX experts to work together

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.880
with accessibility members, raising
out their accessibility issues.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.350
This has not been a work of
the accessibility team alone.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.280
We have the great
contributions in the community.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.620
That we can have both themes,
back-end and front-end,

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.950
accessible in the
higher standards we set.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.800
We also added some
features for Joomla 4,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.280
like a accessibility settings so
that when people have an account

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.820
in your site, they can decide
if they want to see the site

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:58.500
in monochrome, if they want a
bigger font size, a higher contrast,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.770
or highlight the
links, all the links.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.110
That is a decision they made
in their account settings.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.840
They just log in and we have
all the settings they want.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:18.100
We also have some nice plugins
like the skip to links.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.640
This plugin allows you
the skip to button.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.440
When you are navigating
a Joomla 4 website

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.810
and you click the tabular
key, the Tab key, you see,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:39.010
I skip to menu that automatically
detects the structure of your page,

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:46.670
your landmarks, and allows you to
jump to the landmark you choose.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:53.590
Also, one thing that is funny,
we packed Joomla 4 with an overlay.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.030
I know they are very controversial,
and today we agree overlays

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:05.250
are not the need or what
sort of accessibility.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:11.190
We also thought that overlays
can help in some cases

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:20.070
where users do not have the
required ability to manage a website

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.060
or to manage the accessibility
settings in their browser or they are

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.750
in a different browser.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.580
Maybe overlays can help at
some point to some users.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.550
We packed Joomla with this
overlay plugin, which is optional,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.900
and we actually discourage
people to use it as a replacement

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.380
for our fully accessible website.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.680
I guess, we think it
might be useful as well.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:58.625
Also, another thing we have
accomplished in Joomla 4

00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:04.063
is that right now,
Joomla confirms ATAG 2.0.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.590
We have made easier for people
to develop accessible content.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:17.400
We have paid high attention
to images when you need

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.370
to use alt descriptions.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.450
We have made alt description of
choice a real choice for people

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.130
so that they need
to specifically say,

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.960
"No, we do not need another
description for this image."

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.790
If they do not provide
an alt description,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:46.540
and they do not say that they need
another description, they need

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.890
to add another description.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:54.310
It's like, we are trying to make
it easier for content directors

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.940
to have a more accessible website.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.730
Joomla 4 is packed
with TinyMCE editor.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:10.550
We have added some nice features
to make it more accessible.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.750
Finally, we have a fork.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:23.100
A couple of plugins in GitHub to
provide an accessibility test there.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.590
Right now in Joomla when you are
writing a post, you can click

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.490
on test accessibility
button, and then you will see

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.660
how accessible is the
content you are writing.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.430
Actually, that accessibility test
can test your whole front end

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.760
if you want, so it's really nice.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.000
Also in Joomla 4.2,
we have added keyboard shortcuts

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.810
that will help people to move
faster through the Joomla site

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.600
and make it easier to
make whatever they need.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:08.260
We are trying to make sure
that every new addition we put

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.290
into Joomla is accessible.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.040
Finally, the future of Joomla.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.120
We already have plans for Joomla 5,
but one of the biggest intention,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.350
one of our biggest goal is to
audit any new addition we do

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.860
into the code, so that whenever
a new feature is added,

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.560
we are sure that it
is fully accessible.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.560
In Joomla, the structure of
the plugins and deploying

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.400
when you have lots of settings
or you have to manage content

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.610
in the plugins is very standard.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:57.520
It's like very few people
try to add their own designs

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.570
because Joomla provides
with an easy-to-use way

00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:03.680
to create their views.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.650
They do not need to
create their own views.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:17.540
Even though we are trying to
help or to be to ensure that

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:23.560
when people add new features into
Joomla, these are accessible.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:29.750
We want to keep doing improvements
in the way people create content

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.780
in Joomla.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.550
Recently, we have created
a new user experience team.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.400
We have a tight connection
between this team

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.370
and the Joomla accessibility
team so that we can--

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.630
I think from my point of
view, user experience

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:57.590
and accessibility is probably
two sides of the same coin.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:04.800
You just want people to use your
website in the best way possible.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.500
It makes lots of sense to
have a tight relationship

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.513
between this user experience
team and the accessibility team.

00:30:16.366 --> 00:30:30.590
We are committed to develop
lots of documentation, focus on

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.530
how to make Joomla or the
content we create for Joomla

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.060
or the clients you develop
for Joomla more accessible.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.500
We have lot of [inaudible]

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.670
we need to check, edit,
and publish the new documentation.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.270
We have all of that.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:54.470
We really want to have this
documentation where people know

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:59.080
how they can create more
accessible features.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.690
Also, we want to
teach or keep teaching

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.970
or promoting accessibility
between web integrators.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.450
People who use Joomla to
develop their own website

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.610
or their client's websites.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:22.580
We want to keep raising the
voice and making our point

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:26.330
in accessibility so that
they are aware that they need

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.960
to have accessibility in mind
when developing our website.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.230
Seems until right now, we have
focused on making Joomla accessible

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.020
for people who visit the website.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.770
We have also made it so
that Joomla can be used

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.710
to develop this accessible content.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:32:00.760
We have made it so that
Joomla can be used by everyone

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.580
to create content, so it's
accessible to create content.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:16.220
Now we really want to make
Joomla easier to code by people

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.220
in accessible way,
for instance, [inaudible]

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:25.410
we recently abide to PSR-12.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:32.780
That PSR-12 is using tabs instead
of spaces or maybe we need

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.510
to teach that because
when you are programming,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.480
spaces are more accessible.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.550
That's all.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:45.910
We really need to check on that
make it even easier to contribute

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:56.950
for everyone, because as we have in
our name, Joomla is all together.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.760
All together means that everyone
needs to be able to create content,

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.200
to access the content,
and also to develop the tools

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.630
that you are using
to write the content.

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:22.229
Finally, I want to show you
a little piece of advice.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:36.780
Sorry, I got the title of this
slide with a Spanish saying

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.550
and it's Spanish.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.740
I will just say the translation.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.870
I sell tips and for
me, I don't have.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:52.850
In English, you will translate it
as, do as I say, and not as I do.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:57.000
Joomla community, it's a community.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.590
I'm not that into WordPress
community, so I cannot speak

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.574
about your community.

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:04.940
In Joomla, we fight.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.320
We fight a lot.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.513
[inaudible].

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:15.710
Luckily,
we have not physical violence yet.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.000
We have issues as in any community.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:29.080
We also have tried to solve these
issues, but even so, it's hard

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:36.200
to keep this community.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.300
That should not make
you to stop contributing

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.430
because people have
bad days every day.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:52.380
When someone tell you something
different than you were expecting

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.520
and then you got discouraged.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.810
That is not great.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.250
Please keep contributing
with accessibility.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:08.280
Also, everything you get
new to WordPress, test it.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.080
Test it with accessibility in mind.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.110
You cannot probably
make the perfect test

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:18.880
and you might oversee
something, but you can test it.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.410
WordPress is also open
source, is free software.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.350
You can check the new goal,
test it, and raise the issue

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.040
so that it can be fixed.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.060
Also, you have these great
events, like the Contributors Day,

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.340
where you can work on
this kind of stuff.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:54.660
Test any new addition and not accept
or not allow any new integration

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.721
into WordPress that
is not accessible,

00:35:57.247 --> 00:35:59.950
because everything developed

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.660
for content management systems
nowadays should be made

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.140
with accessibility in mind.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.170
Please keep doing that.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.800
Also, this event is great, is huge.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.140
Keep promoting and
teaching accessibility.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:24.050
Yesterday, I was speaking with
a friend, a developer friend

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:30.555
who was not aware of how
awful skating links is bad

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:35.910
for accessibility or how bad
it is to have bad contrast.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:42.040
I keep having clients who,
in their brand design system

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:48.430
have inaccessible color,
so color combinations.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.000
Keep promoting and teaching
accessibility for everyone,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.090
for developers, for designers,
for people writing content,

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.090
for everyone.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.960
Also, do not allow commercial
interests to destruct your tools.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.820
I know that at some
point, we, as a community,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:13.220
do not have that much
strength, but please,

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:20.710
keep fighting against those decisions
that make your system unaccessible.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:27.250
WordPress, I think has more
than 40% of the web, or 70%

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.630
of the web is
developed on WordPress.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.510
You do have a responsibility
for what is happening.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:39.120
At least, when something is
introduced that is not accessible,

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.810
just rest assured that you
have fight against that.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:51.300
That is what I think
at least you could do.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.070
It's not what they can you can
do, is just what they would hope

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.110
for me to do if they
were in this community.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.590
Finally, aim for more.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:06.770
There is not a way or a place
where you can say WordPress

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.570
is fully accessible
because it is not.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.610
There are always issues and you
know when working in accessibility,

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:17.640
some stuff that is working
fine for some users,

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:23.590
for other users is a problem
because it's making them painful,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.120
or more painful process.

00:38:26.353 --> 00:38:35.233
Just try to always keep vigilant,
and aim for more accessible website

00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:37.115
and more accessible content.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.760
That's all I have.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.160
A big thank you to all of you.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.450
A big thank you for the
organization who allowed me

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.220
to give this talk, and a big thank
you for all these communities.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.400
I have been involved in my
local community in WordPress,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.580
and everything is great.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.770
Thank you very much for
everyone who attended this talk

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.540
to learn a bit more about how we
did in Joomla to make it accessible.

00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:11.900
<v Kim> Thank you so much, Carlos.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.670
Yes, the WordPress community
also fights, and we also need

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.820
to look out for
commercial interests.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.880
Your last slide absolutely
hit all the marks

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.010
for the WordPress
community as well.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.170
I really appreciate that.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.640
If you're watching live and you
have questions, you can put them

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.420
into the Q&amp;A section
in the chat area.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.770
I have a couple to start with.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.950
First, Carlos, because your camera's
frozen, just give me a heads up

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.600
or say like, "Okay," to switch back
and forth so I don't cut you off

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.790
when you're responding.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:45.710
Amber asks about your accessibility
test or the JAT that's built-in

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.560
with Joomla.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.030
Can you talk more about
what it checks for

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.740
and what the reports look like and
how you've improved it over time?

00:39:54.793 --> 00:39:55.345
<v Carlos> Yes.

00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:57.135
I'm looking for it.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.200
Joally, Joomla.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:13.990
We call it joally because it's up
on between the letters Joomla and--

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:25.070
Let me go here to check it because
I think we have a link here.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.420
It's between Joomla and ally.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.420
Here it is.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.700
Joomla accessibility checker.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.830
Here it is.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:55.110
If you can see my screen,
it's an overlay but it's not intended

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.940
for your users.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.350
It's intended just for you
as a checker of the content.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.830
I think we have a demo here.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.560
Let's share if it's working.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.500
No.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.838
Here examples.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.310
This is basically a sequel.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.490
This was a GitHub project we found.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:34.090
It was an accessibility checker
by JavaScript, and we contributed

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:41.530
to it so that we remove the
jQuery dependence of the project

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.370
and then we incorporated
it into you.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.440
Obviously, we contributed back
these features to the alpha.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:56.120
I don't know if he added them
to the project, but actually,

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.100
when he was good enough,
we were interested in it.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.310
Whenever you load your article,
the preview of the article,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.480
this line loads here,
and it informs you

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.970
of the accessibility
errors you can't see.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.250
It's an automated
test, so you can expect

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:18.880
as much as an automated test goes.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:26.040
It helps you or non-savvy
users to not take users

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.140
to check the accessibility
more or less easily,

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.500
at least the basic assessment.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.380
Here we have that the taxonomy
evolution it's strong.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.360
We have different issues.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:47.250
When you hover over the danger
icon, you see the image is

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.670
being used as a link,
with surrounding text,

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.680
although reality attributes
should be marked as the current.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.610
Here are some issues.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.480
Let's check another one.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.280
Link text may not be descriptive
enough out of the context.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.920
Learn more link here
is also an issue.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.270
We might have one creating
this content like this.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:16.340
The H4 in this content,
nonconsecutive heading level used.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.298
Headings should never skip levels
or go from Heading 2 to Heading 4.

00:43:25.157 --> 00:43:29.590
You can configure this to be
shown only to author so people

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.900
with high permissions on your site.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.680
You can even set some
configuration directly

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.810
from the link test like
checking for the contrast.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:45.740
Then we have here a contrast issue.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:50.000
You can also check the form levels.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.070
I don't think we
have any form here.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:44:00.860
You can check for three-level CA's
performance or for readability.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.490
Finally, [inaudible].

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.370
Basically,
the checker checks the whole page.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.730
You can't even use it when
you are not in your articles.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.210
It's like you can't even check
a development you are doing

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.800
at a website that is
not about a [inaudible].

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.540
You're just creating
a corporative website.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.250
You can't use Joally to
test the accessibility

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.001
or at least the basic automated
accessibility that they can provide.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.900
That's it, I guess.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.180
<v Kim> That's great.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.350
I think Amber was curious whether
it was a developer-focused tool

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.630
or for the content creators and I
think we can see in this example,

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.290
it's mostly for the
content creators.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.510
We have a follow-up question.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.280
As a Joomla community,
I think there are still extensions,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.210
almost like our plugin
repository with WordPress.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.610
How do you provide documentation
or any testing for the plugins

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.670
and extensions that
are made for Joomla?

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:01.990
How do you enforce that
and maintain the standard?

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.450
<v Carlos> Simply we, we cannot.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:15.700
It's not that we do not want, we
have made some checks about testing.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.120
Well, let me go the whole process.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.150
In Joomla,
we have these extensions repository.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:29.350
It is the Joomla extensions
directory where the users can share

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:33.920
or submit their plugins
or their extensions.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.720
This does not host the page.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.580
This is just advertisement.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.090
It's just a directory who
links to the page of the offer.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:59.280
You do not download them from Joomla,
you download from the alpha page.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:07.460
This is just like an "advertisement"
for these extensions.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.790
It's like you need an extension
and you can't find here

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.060
whatever you need and then
you check with the alpha.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.860
Any case, every extensions
in this directory need to be

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:24.130
or must be free software compatible
with GPL, exactly as you do

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.470
in WordPress.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.540
In WordPress,
I think you have high requirements

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:36.320
because you also need the
developer to upload the plugin

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.900
to the SVN or to your
SVN and other stuff.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.740
In Joomla, we do not do that.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.930
We do check that the plugin is GPL.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:53.210
Also, we do some basic tests,
most of them are automated.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:59.850
This test checks
for basic security.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:05.020
We check that the extensions
do not load external content

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.330
without checking that.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:13.260
We do some basic checks,
but we cannot check accessibility

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.640
because as you know
accessibility is not something

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.300
you can test automatically.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.300
We have some plans.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:27.090
We have some ideas of introducing
Joally into the testing process.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:33.910
We could use Joally to test
the extensions and the result

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.330
of the extensions.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:39.340
The problem with these
Joomla extensions is that

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.660
some of them are very very
complex and they generate lots

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.390
of different views.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.940
It's not so easy to check.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.380
We are discussing
how we could make it

00:47:51.380 --> 00:48:01.500
so that people can provide some
extension or some accessibility

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.260
that manifests or declaration.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.100
We do not have a theme directory.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.680
I think WordPress have a theme
directory, but we do not have it.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.950
In that sense, that is
probably the most critical part

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.600
regarding accessibility.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.260
We cannot check.

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.540
I guess that is.

00:48:22.618 --> 00:48:23.708
Thank you.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.840
<v Kim> No, totally.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.560
I would think that the community's
focus on accessibility,

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.480
in general, might imply that
the extensions themselves carry

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.300
through that same spirit and focus.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.490
To that end, could you speak to
how the focus on accessibility

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.060
from Joomla from
such an early start?

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.000
You said that it's
always been a focus.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.690
How do you think that's
contributed to the success

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:50.720
and the public opinion of the CMS?

00:48:52.807 --> 00:48:59.190
<v Carlos> Well, to be
honest, my impression

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:05.720
about how accessibility has helped
Joomla historical is not that much

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.100
because I don't think people
or developers were interested

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.510
in accessibility.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:15.453
For me,
those involved in accessibility

00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:19.860
in Joomla since 2005 are heroes,

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:24.410
are complete heroes because they
were fighting against the sea

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.060
and against everything
that was there.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.030
For me, they are real heroes.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:41.340
I think at that moment, it was
something extra that you Joomla had

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:50.020
and some people who were developing
websites for public institutions

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.310
or public organizations,
they might need it.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.880
Then they started
looking into that.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.080
There are some theme providers
for Joomla that are focused,

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:04.650
or they have some accessible
themes and that is great,

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.430
but there are some, not that many.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:12.900
It's a bitty, but commercially, I
don't think accessibility has helped

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:13.940
in any sense.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:22.840
Said so, I think that right
now accessibility is in focus.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.530
I mean,
we have big organizations like WC

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:32.270
and all these accessibility
organizations are working

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.580
so that the web is more accessible.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:43.350
Every month we have an accessibility
legal case where someone has

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.410
to pay lots of money because
their website was not accessible.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:54.930
I hope that accessibility is
something that we can demand

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.778
for everyone in the future
and obviously for Joomla

00:50:58.778 --> 00:51:02.560
and for WordPress and Drupal and
PrestaShop and all this stuff.

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:05.340
<v Kim> I love that.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.230
I love that.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.960
We have one quick question if
you could speak to it quickly?

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.280
How do people get in touch and get
involved in the Joomla community?

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.830
We know where we do
this with WordPress,

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:17.620
but if you're having an issue
with your files or your website

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.500
or things like that, what are
the best ways to get involved

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.780
in and immersed in
the Joomla community?

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.270
<v Carlos> Well,
I think one of the best options.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.450
If you're having an
issue with Joomla,

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.570
I think the best option is
going to- you go to joomla.org

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:39.370
and you will see
this nice top menu.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.090
One of the entries is
community and support.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:49.470
Under that community and support menu
entry, you can see some sub-menus,

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:53.660
and one of them is the forum,
where you can request help

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.790
or search for help.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.430
If you are looking for a more
professional help, you can go

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:04.330
to the service providers
directory under the same menu.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:09.490
Also, if you just want to
help or start contributing

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:15.410
to a Joomla project,
you can go to the volunteers portal,

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:18.335
which is also under the
community and support menu.

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.720
<v Kim> It's perfect.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Carlos> I will go to that
community and support menu,

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.870
and I think it's
everything we need.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:32.320
Also, this year we were
honored with the Google Summer

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.100
of Code contribution or project.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:43.900
We had some students working to
develop some features for Joomla.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:53.340
That's also a good way of
starting to contribute to Joomla

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.540
because you get all the benefits
of the Google Summer of Code.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:02.460
If you want to get involved into
accessibility, we usually try

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.480
to have an accessibility
project in our school or Summer

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.785
of Code projects.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.220
<v Kim> Perfect.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.490
Well, thank you so much, Carlos.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:11.840
We have to end it here.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.390
I hope everyone
enjoyed this session.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:18.480
You can continue chatting using
our hashtags on social media.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.887

get a free t-shirt.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:24.400
I'm checking out as host.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.440
We have Devon Edgar coming
up next with a presentation

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.670
on boosting up conversions with
accessible e-commerce at 12:00 UTC.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:36.510
