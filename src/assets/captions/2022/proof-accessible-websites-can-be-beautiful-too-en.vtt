00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Abbas Jaffary>
Hi, welcome everybody

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.789
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.380
My name is Abbas Jaffary,
I'm a mathematics teacher and tutor,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.310
working on getting more
mathematics accessible on the web.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.360
I want to thank you for
joining us for the proof

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.380
that accessible websites can be
beautiful too with Gary Aussant

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.186
who's the Director of Digital
Accessibility Consulting

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.910
at Perkins Access.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.480
Gary has a 25-year career
in digital technology

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.880
and user experience consulting
with such Fortune 100 companies

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.308
as Bank of America,
Microsoft, Google,

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:08.300
Facebook, eBay, General Motors,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.660
Transamerica, and Twitter, helping
them embrace inclusive design.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.830
He specializes in design
thinking and usability testing

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.750
to improve digital experiences early
in the product development process,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.020
and helps clients sustain digital
accessibility through best practices

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.200
and day-to-day operations.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.750
As we also have Stephen Plummer,
who's a Creative Manager

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.730
at the Perkins
School for the Blind.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.740
He's a creative designer based in
the Boston area, has been working

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.830
with nonprofits and educational
institutions such as the YMCA

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.110
of the USA and Boston
University, for over 10 years.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.790
Stephen started working with
the Perkins School for the Blind

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.800
in 2017, where he has not only
been able to hone his skills

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.530
as a designer,
but to also incorporate

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.700
digital accessibility practices
into every project.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.820
Please, feel free to add your
questions in the Q&amp;A tab in Slido,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.860
and we'll answer them at
the end of the session.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.380
Please, use the idea section
to chat with other attendees.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.950
Without further ado, I will turn
it over to Gary and Stephen.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Gary Aussant> Thank you so
much, Abbas.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.930
Thank you for that introduction,
and welcome everybody

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.360
to our presentation where
we will present proof

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.600
that accessible websites
can be beautiful.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.470
Today, Stephen and I are going
to just present a case study

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.660
of how we went about redesigning
our own website and moving it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.790
to the WordPress CMS.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.620
We're going to start by
talking about how we worked

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.010
with a third-party design firm,
how we selected that design firm,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.920
and how we included people with
disabilities and accessibility,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.300
subject matter experts
in our design effort.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.770
We're going to talk about the
process that we went through,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.390
and then we're going to talk
about 10 key design considerations

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760
that we weighed when we
were creating our website.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.110
<v Stephen Plummer> Great.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.790
Thanks, Gary.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.480
This is Stephen speaking now.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.983
I'm going to give just a brief
background on Perkins School

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.430
for the Blind.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.550
Perkins is an organization that
is almost 200 years old now.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.490
It's where Helen Keller and Anne
Sullivan were both educated.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.200
Since then, we've grown into much
more than just a school in Boston.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.970
We are a global NGO with a mission
to help the 240 million children

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.960
with multiple disabilities worldwide
to learn, and we're currently working

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.010
in nearly 100 countries.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.030
A critical part of that
work is ensuring access

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.980
to an increasingly digital world,
and that brings us to Perkins Access,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.080
which I'll now let Gary
say a few things about.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.400
<v Gary> As Stephen mentioned,
Perkins is a growing organization

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.080
and the school has a mission to
prepare the students of Perkins

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.750
for the world, to help them lead
successful and independent lives.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.490
Perkins Access is an organization
that is a department of the school

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.570
that provides professional
consulting services.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.320
Our mission of Perkins Access is to
prepare the world for our students

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.270
and others with disabilities,
and we do that by working

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.520
with businesses and organizations
in the US and around the world

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.340
to help them make their websites
and other digital products

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.578
and services as
accessible as possible

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:44.300
for people with disabilities.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.190
One of the primary ways that our
clients find out about our services

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.720
and what we do at Perkins
Access is through our website,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.160
they come to us looking
for guidance about

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.060
how to make their own
websites accessible.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.700
Obviously, organizations don't
want to sacrifice aesthetics

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.860
or look and feel for accessibility.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.360
Our old website,
as you can see on the screen here,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.710
although it was accessible,
it wasn't really proving

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.600
that the accessible websites
could also be well designed.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600
It was frankly boring.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.510
The color palette, for example,
had two shades of blue mostly.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.560
We overdid the color contrast
in some of the controls

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.550
like the carousel buttons,
which you could see here

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.680
that are very black and white.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.380
We had text on top of images,
but the black background

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.880
that we added behind the text to
improve contrast really obscured

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.630
the image in the hero banner.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.780
We had links that,
frankly, were underlined

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.123
and looked a little outdated,
you could see the screenshot

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:57.670
on the right.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.290
That's our blog page.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.960
We had text on top of gray background
that is more difficult to read.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.910
We also had different text sizes
that can give the appearance

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.210
of visual clutter.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.060
Importantly, back then when we
had this website, we used Drupal

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.030
as our CMS, and it really had
a complicated user interface.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.460
It made it difficult for anyone on
our team, any of our consultants

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.240
to post blog articles
and other content.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.360
We typically had to get some
folks from our marketing team

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.200
or IT team to put those
posts up for us, so we wanted

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.490
to simplify this and
make a better experience

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.030
and put a better presentation
out there to the world.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.540
<v Stephen> We knew we had an
ambitious project ahead of us,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.090
not only were we redesigning
the Perkins Access site,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.410
but also the full Perkins School
for the Blind family of sites.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.510
First thing we had to figure out
was who is going to be a part

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.450
of our team to make
this project happen.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.530
Looking inward to us as the
clients, we had myself

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.400
as the creative director,
our chief marketing officer,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.100
senior director of marketing,
and our director of digital strategy

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.940
as well as, from Perkins
Access, their marketing manager

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.600
as well as all a part
of the client's team.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.070
We knew that we wanted to
partner with a design agency

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.920
who could really help us to bring in
a few fresh ideas and perspectives.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.860
We considered a number of
different agencies we really wanted

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.740
to test their claims about having
had accessibility expertise,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.980
checking into their
portfolio to make sure

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.950
that they've made
other accessible sites,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:05.050
seeing that they are legitimately
passionate about inclusive design

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.550
and checking what platforms
and content management systems

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.810
that they had to experience with.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.480
We also wanted to make sure, from
the very beginning of the project,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.880
that we included our accessibility
subject matter experts.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.530
In our case, it just so happens
that our experts are Perkins Access.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.630
In this instance, client and
expert, there was overlap there,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.630
but making sure those
experts had a voice

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.300
and were seeing the earliest
iterations of design

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.190
and development right from the
start was critical in making sure

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.590
that this all went
according to plan.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.050
They were not only involved with
the Perkins Access site redesign,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.780
but all the other family
of sites to follow.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.930
We just decided we were going
to start with Perkins Access.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.350
Then, of course, working with
our expert Perkins Access team,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:20.180
they were able to give us
the access to end users.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, these end users
represented potential clients

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.850
who would be evaluating our
website both for accessibility.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.500
We claim to be
accessibility experts,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.560
then we should have an accessible
site, and people, our clients,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.610
are certainly going to
be looking out for that.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.420
It was very important
to be getting that right

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.300
and to have that user testing.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.630
These end users also include
those people with disabilities

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.090
who may be using assistive
technologies such as screen readers

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.290
to access the website.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.776
Very important to have those
individuals there to help us.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Gary> After we selected our
team, we really went

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.420
through what would be a
typical design process,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.580
and that typically starts with
starting with some research

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.760
to understand the needs of your
users and a few other things,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.600
all the way to hopefully
a successful launch.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.650
As Stephen mentioned,
our team included accessibility,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.210
subject matter experts in
the perspectives of users

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.900
with disabilities very early on.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:45.810
We call this a shift-left strategy,
which is to include accessibility

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.840
as early as possible, and that
will save you a lot of headaches

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.130
and a lot of money down the road.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.830
You're much more likely to
design for those needs early

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.940
and nip a lot of the potential
accessibility barriers in the bud.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.960
Where we started,
we started with our research

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.215
and that included not
only understanding

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:08.590
who our users were going

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.260
to be but also researching the
agencies that we were considering.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.000
As Stephen mentioned,
we wanted to make sure

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.980
that we selected an agency with
some subject matter expertise

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.940
with accessibility.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.300
We evaluated a lot of
the sites that they did.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.040
We also wanted to look into the
different content management systems,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.700
and we chose WordPress
because it was easy to use.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:35.080
It had a number of features
that allowed content creators

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.240
to publish accessible content.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.980
We really were evaluating those
content management systems against

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.490
what's called the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines that talks

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.420
about the things that these authoring
tools should provide to make sure

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.350
that you can create
accessible content.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.480
Then finally, our research
went through are we going

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.460
to use an existing theme or
are we going to build our own?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:04.410
In the end, we decided to have the
design agency build our own theme.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.260
Once we got into the design
process, it was really focused

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:14.510
on building that theme, taking our
existing Perkins brand style guide

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.290
and creating a new digital
style guide for our new site.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.010
We're going to talk a
little bit about that.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.440
we're going to talk about how
we made selections for color

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.400
that we were going to use on the
site, and how we made selections

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.310
about the fonts that we were
going to select so that we ensured

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.370
that they would be easy to read.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.570
During the design phase,
we were reacting to a lot of things

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:43.580
that the design agency was sending to
us, and we used their design tools,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.950
at the time, it was envision,
and we would go right

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.250
into the envision designs and
provide our accessibility feedback

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.320
to what the design
agency was creating.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.150
We started our feedback very early
on so that that can be worked

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.150
into the prototype.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.800
Now, the prototype is really
where the rubber hits the road.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.040
This is where you're starting
to put your designs into html,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.820
and this is when you
start seeing if that html

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.050
and that front-end code is going to
interact with assistive technologies.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.200
With the prototype, it starts with
looking at those page templates

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.130
and really trying to make sure
that, at a page level,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.910
you have a lot of the
accessibility features built in.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.360
Is the page responsive?

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.140
Do you have language attributes?

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.090
Are you allowing people to-- will
the content reflow in the page?

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.710
A lot of those things you
can tackle in the template.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.470
Also, what are the things that
are going in the templates?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.100
There's widgets that are based on
design patterns, things that we see

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.970
on the web every day today,
like accordions and carousels.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.710
We wanted to make sure that all
those design patterns would work,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.230
for example, with the keyboard.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.900
We started to look at those
design patterns very early on.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.470
During the prototype phase, we would
get feedback, again very early on.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.940
Once we had some accessible
templates and widgets

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.100
and design patterns, that's
when we started to put our copy

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.650
into the pages and creating blog
posts, and uploading our images

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.690
into the media library.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.020
What was really critical
about the content phase is

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.380
that we did training with our
content creators so they understood

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.900
how they could create
accessible content,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.620
how they could publish
accessible content.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.350
We're going to talk a little
bit about what we did there.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:37.690
We also did some customization
of the WordPress admin interface

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.210
to make sure that our content
creators can only do certain things.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.360
We'll talk a little bit about that.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.180
Then finally, we got to launch.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.200
We couldn't do everything
prior to launch.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.830
We really tried to remove as many of
the critical accessibility barriers

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.900
and make it as closely
aligned to the web content

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.230
accessibility guidelines, meeting
those guidelines as much as possible

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.460
but there were some little
smaller things that enhancements

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.470
that we had to put on our backlog.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.290
We went through a prioritization
process there to make sure

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.070
that we can return to those and
address those things in the future.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.030
One great thing about
WordPress is there's a plugin

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.790
that will allow you to, in the
WordPress staging environment,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.970
to provide feedback on a page.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.040
This widget actually
connects into Jira.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.580
We installed that into
WordPress, and as we were testing

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.550
our staging environment, we would
click the provide feedback button

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.940
on the right, and then we
would log Jira tickets right

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.830
into the environment,
and that would feed

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.340
into our design firm's Jira
system, and then we're able

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.810
to address those issues
as we were testing

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.770
so it's a really
great feature to have.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Stephen> Having worked at
Perkins for five years now,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.360
I can say that one of my
biggest recommendations

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.900
for other organizations,
is to bake accessibility

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.760
into your brand style
guide from the start.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.340
When you're going off to
redesign a website or jump

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:29.010
into any other project, it makes
things so much more streamlined

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.100
because you're not having
to figure out how to make

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.730
as many things accessible along
the way because they already are.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.340
You'll see from some of
the slides coming up,

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.860
have a few screenshots
from our brand style guide.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.190
You can see how some of those
accessibility considerations

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.190
are included right there
from the very start.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.870
Here we have 10 key design
considerations that I will be going

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.980
into more detail in a moment.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:13.820
The first being that accessibility
and good aesthetics often overlap.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.550
We'll go over selecting a
good accessible color palette,

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:27.430
having proper color contrast,
typography, visual hierarchy,

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:33.500
link styles, good focus and
hover states, click targets,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.870
photography and iconography, and,
of course, mobile optimization.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.620
We've noticed that there is a
myth floating around out there

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.080
that an accessible
website is ugly and boring

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.320
and that it must sacrifice aesthetic
appeal in order for its work.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.690
Now, this is simply not true.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.390
Accessible websites
can be beautiful.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.680
It doesn't have to be basic.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.721
Aesthetics don't need
to be sacrificed,

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.850
and, in fact, there is a lot

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.520
of overlap between what
is considered good design

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.100
and accessibility best practices.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.750
We'll jump into color palette.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:30.460
As I said, this is a screenshot
from our brand guidelines,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.630
and I have good news.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.550
You can have a bright and fun color
palette on your accessible website,

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.940
but you should be choosing
your colors very intentionally.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.650
From our guidelines here, you can
see that we have color palette

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.390
that reflects vibrancy
and also a sense of youth

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.910
to represent the youth that
are core to our mission.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.020
It's very important to
have a variety of colors

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:07.200
to fit multiple situations
and to retain visual interests

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.140
across multiple pages.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:19.570
You see here we've categorized our
colors, "dark colors" at the top.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:26.420
This just refers to colors that
have good contrast with white texts

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.420
and white backgrounds.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.980
Also, we have "light colors"
that contrast well with black

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.690
or very dark text and backgrounds.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.550
Now, of course, these colors,
it's possible for them

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:46.180
to have good contrast with other
colors other than black and white,

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.840
but we just use those two
extremes of black and white

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:58.710
as an easier way to illustrate the
point of what we're doing here.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.100
From color into color contrast.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.610
The number one accessibility
barrier on the web today

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:17.500
is poor color contrast.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.660
Good color contrast not
only benefits people

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.680
with visual impairments but,
really, it benefits everybody.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:32.050
Think about if you're using
screen that has some glare,

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.590
or you're using an older monitor
that has less brightness.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.090
There's lots of great
tools out there for people

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:46.100
to measure the contrast ratio between
foreground and background colors.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.960
Just put a search into
color contrast analyzer,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.000
plenty of things
are going to pop up.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.280
Now to meet the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.796
you should have at least
4.5:1 content ratio

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:07.340
between colors for
regular-size font.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.760
Now, of course, this doesn't
apply as well, to other things

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.900
than just text.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:21.250
Obviously, text is a big subject
for readability and legibility,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.950
but you see there, there's a couple
of examples of informative graphics.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.870
That little arrow that
indicates go onto another image

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.810
or another slide, the change
of color in the underlying

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.730
for the link changing to yellow,
which has very low contrast

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.780
with a white background.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.280
Color contrast, it's very
important to make sure that is top

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.930
of mind when you're designing.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.120
In fact, you can customize
your colors in WordPress.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.440
The WordPress ColorPicker.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.540
You might want to actually consider
removing some of those colors

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.290
that won't provide enough
contrast, depending on what kind

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.300
of color background you're using.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.920
That can be a good tip to nip
bad color contrast in [inaudible]

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.710
Right.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.500
Typography.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.330
We knew that when we're going
through our redesign that we wanted

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.270
to to switch up our typography.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:37.190
We wanted a typeface that was
going to be clean, clear, readable,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.840
but also just more
modern, more refresh feel.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:48.420
We ended up with Avenir Next as
our main typeface across our family

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420
of sites.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.360
In general, a sans serif font
or typeface is recommended.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.510
When I say serif,
I'm referring to the small strokes

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.900
that sometimes protrude off
of the end of a larger stroke.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.591
Also, fonts that have
extra decorative elements

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:19.200
are not really recommended as far
as digital accessibility goes.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.570
Mainly because when those
particular typefaces need

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.220
to be scaled down,
sometimes those extra serifs

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.080
or decorative elements can
end up bleeding together

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.820
into the letter form and it
becomes less distinguishable

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.970
what letter form is
being represented.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.810
Speaking of which, you just
want to make sure that, looking

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:53.770
at the alphabets, all the letters
are easily distinguishable

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.260
from one another.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.630
Humanist fonts are-- a
quality of humanist fonts is

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:08.450
that they have varying
widths and heights.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.100
Even though Avenir
Next is very geometric,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.700
it does have humanist qualities in
that they do have those variations

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.360
of character widths and
heights, which makes it, again,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.040
much more easy for someone to
distinguish one shape from another.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.910
Then the last thing I'll just
touch on as far as typography goes,

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.980
and picking a good typeface for
accessibility is making sure

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:46.860
that you have letter forms that
have large and clear counters.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.670
What I mean by that are the
shapes inside of letters,

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:58.640
that triangle inside of the
capital A, the half circle,

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:07.430
or even the counter area above
the tail of the lowercase E,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.310
those are your counters that you
want to be very clear and visible.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.630
Again, just so whenever
it's scaled down,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.953
that you can really more easily
distinguish one shape from another.

00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Gary> After we chose our
fonts, and we started

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.760
to put our designs together,
visual hierarchy was very,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.960
very important for us.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.000
This is a visual design
principle that designers can use

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.310
to show the importance
of each page's contents

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.760
by manipulating things like the
size of the elements, the color

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.440
of the elements, the
contrast, using alignment,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.120
and whitespace as well,
you could also use imagery

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.010
to create a visual hierarchy.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.340
We're very intentional about how we
put this visual hierarchy together.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.130
We also wanted to make sure that
the hierarchy that was implied

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.660
by the visual design
could also be translated

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.280
to assistive technology,
such as a screen reader.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.960
Now, in some of our page
templates, we wanted

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.440
to visually emphasize a
subheading, for example,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.600
under the page's main
heading, which was styled

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.590
in what we call this
eyebrow text format.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.610
If you look at the screenshot on
the left, we have this eyebrow text

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:34.480
that's smaller,
and then a larger sub-headline.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.750
When we started to insert
our content into this design,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.320
we realized that,
you know what, what's going

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.870
in the eyebrow is actually the
primary heading for the page.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.440
On the right, you can see that
this is our page where we talk

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.000
about working with
financial services clients.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.970
That financial services text
is really the name of the page,

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.770
it's the page's title, it's the link
that you use to get to this page.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.860
That really serves
as a better heading 1

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.600
than the larger text underneath it.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.750
We were very cognizant of that
and we made sure that WordPress

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.540
in the template that would
implement that as an H1 heading,

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:25.230
and that the subheading, that was
larger was actually an H2 subheading.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.460
We did that purposely.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.520
We wanted to make sure that that
would translate to screen readers.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.060
Another example,
what we did is we wanted

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:40.410
to have really engaging less things
that were visually prominent,

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.730
but we didn't want to lose the
semantic meaning of the lists.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.250
Meaning that screen readers
would announce those lists

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.990
and some information about
those lists as list item 104.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.530
What we did was we created some
image bullets that were brought

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.090
into the list,
but we kept the list structure

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.170
so that the information was
still communicated as a list,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.870
even though maybe it doesn't
look like a typical list, it had

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.650
more than one column, for example,
but there's still four list items

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.140
in this list.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:18.580
We made sure that the visual
design still was built

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.470
on the semantic meaning of the
content so that screenreader users

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.000
who are blind can still understand
the structure of the page.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.130
Another purposeful thing that we
did in the WordPress admin site

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.770
is we gave a lot of thought,
first of all, to the size

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.400
and weight of our headings styles.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.410
We really didn't want
our content authors

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:51.120
who were using the WordPress rich
text editor to have confusion

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.700
about the headings and use too
many different styles for headings.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.390
Now, we knew that our templates
really created a heading 1

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.300
at the top of the page and
that was really the page title.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.150
The page title would be
inserted as the heading 1.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.510
Then when we did the content
for the page, which was

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.060
in like a blog post format,
we removed the heading 1

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.080
because we didn't want somebody
to use the heading 1 inside

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.030
of that content.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.650
We removed that from
the heading picker.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.320
The other thing that
we did was we knew

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.950
that our content wasn't
going to be so deep

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:33.150
that we would need heading 5's and
heading 6's, so we removed those

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.480
as well.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.109
Really, the only choices
for our content creators

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:39.700
were heading 2, 3 and 4.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.250
That really helped us to make sure
that the heading styles weren't

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.690
being abused.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.400
If somebody wanted to have
bigger texts or larger text,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.430
we didn't want them to
use the headings for that,

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.480
but use text size
controls for that.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.340
We needed assistance from
a developer to do this

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.800
and we thought it
was well worth it.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.330
The other thing is if you do do
these types of customizations,

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.360
if you update your WordPress
version to the latest version,

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.050
sometimes it may knock out
all of the updates that you do

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.210
on the content author side,
but we thought it was well worth it

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.930
to go through those updates
each time we updated WordPress

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.344
because this would help
us to keep our content

00:30:22.345 --> 00:30:23.730
as accessible as possible.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.230
We also gave a lot of thought
to the design and color choices

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.290
for our links styles.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.010
We really wanted our links,
especially our call-to-action links

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.880
or CTAs to really
stand out visually.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.096
Another thing that we
had a discussion about

00:30:43.097 --> 00:30:45.712
is many of the designs
on the web these days

00:30:45.713 --> 00:30:47.630
are no longer underlining links.

00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:52.080
This can make it difficult to
know what is clickable on a page,

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.890
especially if the link colors
do not have enough contrast

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.980
with the surrounding texts
or the static text colors.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.910
You'll see a lot of times
links might be blue,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.290
but the text would be black.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:13.210
Some people with colorblindness,
which affects about 8% of men,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.440
may have difficulty
spotting those links.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.450
We wanted people to be able
to know where the links are.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.610
We decided to underline
just about all of our links,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.760
or at least most of them, so that it
was really clear what was clickable.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:35.390
We also added a consistent visual
cue by using yellow to indicate all

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.380
of the things that were
clickable on the page.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.970
Our link buttons, we used them
for little arrows, for example,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.570
so that you can also spot the links
by spotting the color differences.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.780
We made sure that this yellow
color had enough contrast

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.510
between white and dark blue
backgrounds so that it was flexible

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.690
and we can use it in those
different backgrounds.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.370
One other really important thing
that we did with our links is

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.890
that we really tried to avoid
the generic learn more's

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.960
and read more's that you see, those
CTAs that are just really generic.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.350
We wanted to make sure that our
links were meaningful on their own.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.570
Instead of having like a
learn more CTA or an explore

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:22.510
all CTA under our featured services,
we just did the extra thing

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.860
and said, explore all services
or learn more about us.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.790
This really made the link stand
out on their own if somebody were

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.210
to use assisted
technology, a link list.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.340
It's also really good for SEO.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.520
It gives search engine bots an idea
of like what that link is all about.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.990
That was really a win-win for us.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.230
Then, I also will talk
about, we wanted

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.710
to really enforce the
clickability or the affordance

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.590
of the clickability in
our interactive elements.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.760
We added some design elements
and color choices to our focus

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.510
and our hover state so
that we covered use cases

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:06.300
for both keyboard
users and mouse users.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.120
For example, on our featured
services, when you hover over one

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.330
of these blocks,
the whole thing is clickable.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.570
It has a slight grow effect,
so it grows very slightly

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.280
and a border appears around it.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.690
We add the color
backgrounds to the link

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:31.730
and we remove the underline so
that it really feels like dynamic.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.340
We did this for both our
hover and focus states.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.900
One of the things that we see
at Perkins Access when we work

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.490
with clients is, a lot of designers,
they give a lot of thought

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.860
to hover states, but they
don't give equal consideration

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.080
to what the element would
look like when it has focus.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.750
We see a lot of sites that just rely
on the default browser focus style.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.170
In those cases,
you're really missing an opportunity

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.340
to reinforce your brand
for keyboard users

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.170
by creating a really customized
focus style in addition

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.220
to your hover style.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.620
We gave a lot of consideration
to that in the design phase.

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:19.740
<v Stephen> Just continuing on
speaking of focus and hover states,

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:26.360
here we have an example of a
couple of our resource cards

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.670
both a static view and as well as
the hover and focus view there.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:39.350
As you can see, these resource
cards have several parts to them.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:45.700
There's the feature image, there's
a title CTA, short description,

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.070
some category tags.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.570
We decided we were going to do
something interesting with these.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:59.660
Rather than making each of those
individual parts a clickable element,

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.460
we decided that we were going to
group all of these elements together

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:10.090
and actually make the whole
card itself a clickable element,

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:13.660
creating a much
larger touch target.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:20.980
This makes it easier for those that
may have mobility disabilities,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.565
but it's also just more
mobile-friendly, in general,

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:25.760
for all users.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:35.300
It also helped in making these
links not overly complicated

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.380
for someone who might be
using a screen reader.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:45.320
In this case, only the title
is announced to those users

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.750
so that they don't need to
cycle through every element

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:55.580
for every card, every time,
and potentially get an overload

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:01.390
of audio information that could,
quite frankly, become repetitive

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:08.060
to someone who's not necessarily
relying on the visual

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.130
to get their information.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:19.470
Then speaking of the imagery that
they're using on the new site,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.560
accessible websites, they can
include a lot of photographic images

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.010
and graphics to add
visual interest.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:38.100
It's important to make sure you're
choosing photos that are clear,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.350
that have a well-lit subject.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:46.590
It's also recommended to have
a good crop of your photo

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:53.030
to reduce any visual
information that isn't important

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.240
to your message, or any clutter
that might be in the background.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:05.900
We also recommend trying not
to overlay texts on photos.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:11.090
I know we looked at a lot of
examples of sites that do that.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:18.530
It can become a bit
of a visual overload,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.330
especially if there is a
background photo with text on top

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.800
of it that is overly complicated.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.049
It may muddy up your message
and the legibility of your text.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.050
It actually makes it more
difficult, honestly,

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.410
for whoever is updating your site.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.020
If you need to change out that photo,
that's just an extra consideration

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.930
that you have to take into
account is, am I using a photo

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.650
that's going to contrast well with
the text that's being overlaid?

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.900
That just adds onto your process
and makes it more difficult.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:10.050
Also, with images in WordPress,
you can describe your images

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.320
for those people
who can't see them.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.640
It also gives them access to
the information that is provided

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.110
by the image.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:25.630
It's also just good for SEO to
have image descriptions included.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.880
That isn't to say that all images
necessarily need to be described.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:38.210
In fact,
describing decorative iconography

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:44.190
or graphics can become audio
overload for screen reader users.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.980
What do I mean by
a decorative image?

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:53.000
In other words, it's an image or a
graphic that has a primary objective

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.190
to be a visual interest support
rather than really adding anything

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.750
to the critical messaging.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:09.280
We see here an example of
a piece of iconography.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.600
It's nice, it maybe,
it supports the message,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:19.170
but it's not necessarily adding
anything new to the conversation,

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.810
at least not from the
perspective of someone

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.180
who's listening on-screen reader.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.020
This is just an example here,
a screenshot from the backend

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.120
of WordPress in the media library.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.380
You see there that the alternative
text field is left blank

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.010
for this particular graphic.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:50.560
We have an arrow there that points
you to a link to a resource,

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:59.670
which will help you to determine
whether a image is decorative

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.334
or if it is critical to have
alternative texts describe it.

00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:08.070
<v Gary> Some images are
informative and you want

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.910
to provide a description through
the alternative text field

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.760
in the WordPress Media Library.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.820
This is an example of one of those
images on that previous screen.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.070
We want to describe this because
this is giving users an idea

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:28.540
of what Perkins is all about,
which is teaching young children

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:34.050
with visual disabilities how to lead
an independent and fulfilling life.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.110
In this case,
the image is described as girl

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.330
with glasses selecting a color
on tablet with tablet pen.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.910
Typically, those descriptions can
be a short phrase or sentence.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:50.180
They don't have to go into
too much detail, but you want

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.950
to provide equivalent information
to screen-reader users that is

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:01.020
being communicated through the image
to people who can perceive the image.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.470
One thing that there's
a lot of confusion about

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.630
in the WordPress attachment
details model is,

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.400
where do you put the
alternative text?

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.750
Because there's a lot of fields that
sound like they do the same thing.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.730
There's a title field,
there's a caption field,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.570
there's a description field.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:24.180
The only one that is relevant
really for accessibility,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.010
is the alternative text field.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.430
The title field is an internal
resource that's only going to dictate

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.520
how the image is displayed and
sorted in the media library.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.480
You can certainly use
it for your own benefit,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.720
but it will not be translated
to the actual website.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:45.900
The caption field can be
used in some cases, and what

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.860
that's going to do is add the
description underneath the photo,

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.050
but really the theme
is going to dictate

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.790
whether or not that caption shows
up or what that caption looks like.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.440
There might be some
cases where you want

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.380
to have the description
visible to everybody.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.900
The description field is really an
optional description of the image

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.600
that displays on the
images attachment page.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.790
WordPress creates an attachment
page for every image,

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:15.290
and that description will show up
there but it's not really necessary

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.790
for alternative texts
for screen-reader users.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.470
The last design consideration
that we have that we want

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.980
to talk about is we all
know that most visits

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.430
to your website are very likely
going to come from someone

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.480
who's using a mobile device.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.850
It's really important to ensure
that your theme works for devices

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.760
such as smartphones and tablets.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.870
In our design, we really followed
a mobile-first philosophy.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:46.300
That means that we design for
mobile devices first, and then saw

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.420
how our designs can be
translated to larger screens.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.990
This really forced us
to focus on simplicity,

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.290
which really benefits all users,
including those with disabilities.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.830
Focusing on mobile,
you're making sure that all

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.700
of your pages are responsive,
which means that the layout adjusts

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.520
and the content reflow is based
on the width of the viewport.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.000
Having a responsive site
doesn't just benefit people

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.260
who are using phones
and small monitors.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.300
It also benefits people
who have visual impairments

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.850
who are using a desktop computer
and using the browser zoom control

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.680
so that they can increase
the size of the text,

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.988
because what that does is

00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:31.500
it typically will trigger
the responsive mode,

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.910
and it still allows all of the
content to fit within the viewport.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.960
There are a lot of people that
use zoom on desktop monitors,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.710
and we want to make sure that
that content is going to fit

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.310
when that happens.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.280
Obviously, you want to make sure that
when you're testing your website,

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.050
you want to make sure that
you're including mobile devices

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:53.840
in your testing procedures as well.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:04.920
<v Stephen> Here we have a before and
after of our Perkins Access webpage.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.680
You can clearly see a
big difference here.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.060
We now have intentional bright
colors that direct the eye

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.660
to critical CTAs and messaging.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.400
We have a clear visual hierarchy.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.980
We have bright and welcoming
human connection in the imagery

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:33.750
that we chose, not looking so
sterile and corporate anymore.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.710
As well as clear and well-contrasted
texts that, in some cases,

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.272
may have some
interaction with imagery,

00:44:42.272 --> 00:44:46.417
but never necessarily interferes
or distracts from it.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:55.360
Another before and after here with
going back to our resource cards.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:03.410
You can see-- obviously, I talked
a bit about making the entire card

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.330
a larger clickable target,
but you can also see

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.680
we have much better contrast by
removing that gray background.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.470
We've added a CTA with a
colorful indicator there to try

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:21.030
and draw more attention,
and of course,

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.750
incorporated our more
modern-looking typeface.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.620
Here's a few examples.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:39.910
There's several different sites
across the Perkins Organization.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:47.030
Here we have Perkins Access, the
Perkins School for the Blind sites,

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.030
Perkins India.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:56.840
The goal really here was to have
cohesion among this family of sites.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:03.610
We have re-useable blocks and
themes built out in WordPress.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:11.780
We have consistent typefaces,
contrast link styles,

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:16.960
but there's also still plenty of
room for variation when it's needed.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.120
For example, if you look at the
Perkins India webpage there,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:28.770
we actually have a unique color
palette for Perkins India to speak

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.320
to a different audience
in a different country.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.180
There's still plenty of
that room for customization

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.710
and for everything to have
its own unique identity,

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:44.670
but still look cohesive.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.640
<v Gary> I hope that this case
study was helpful for everybody.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.000
We wanted to share our experience
of redesigning our site

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.430
and some of the considerations
that we had along the way

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.850
and hit on some of
those key points.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.510
I hope we prove that accessible
sites can be beautiful.

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:08.880
We wanted to thank WordPress for
including us in this important topic

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.780
and this great set of talks.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.040
Thank you very much.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.930
With that, we'll take any
questions that anybody

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.030
in the audience might have.

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:23.430
<v Abbas> Thank you so
much, Gary and Stephen.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.430
So much great info and I really
appreciate such wonderful examples

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.060
that the intersection of
functionality and aesthetics is huge

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.020
and should be huge and
should be taken seriously.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.450
Really quickly,
just a few questions.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.790
One is,
will the slides be available?

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.730
And, is your brand style guide
publicly available, by chance?

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:48.740
<v Gary> Yes, we could definitely
make the slides available.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.000
Stephen, I don't know
about the second question

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.310
if you know the answer to that?

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.830
<v Stephen> I think,
like the slides, we can work

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.380
on making those available.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.540
I know that is a goal of
ours to be able to have them

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:08.330
on the site itself to share them
more easily, but I'd be happy to--

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:09.887
that out there.

00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:11.250
<v Abbas> Thank you.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.700
We'll get that information out.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.590
I have one question.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.020
What was the feedback plugin
that you had mentioned earlier?

00:48:20.278 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Gary> I don't recall
the exact name of it,

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.540
but it's a Jira integration,
that can be brought into WordPress.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:34.650
I could take that as
a follow-up and see

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.880
if I could find the
exact name of the plugin,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.860
but our design firm
implemented that for us.

00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Abbas> Oh, wonderful.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.670
Have you, by chance, tested your
new font with users of dyslexia?

00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Stephen> Yes, dyslexia was
something that we had in mind

00:48:55.510 --> 00:49:00.780
when we were researching typefaces.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.470
Definitely, fonts that are
more, like I said before,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.620
have that humanist quality to them.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.340
Another quality of that
is that there's variation

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:22.080
in the stroke sizes, which does tend
to help with dyslexia being able

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.600
to recognize those forms
a little bit better.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.530
There's another site within
our Perkins Family sites

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.800
that actually has its own typeface.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.640
Again, another customization
to give it its own identity,

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.320
which actually even goes further
with some of those elements.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:49.700
For example, we have the lowercase
l, it has a little tail off

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:54.160
of the end of it so that it's
more easy to distinguish that

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.030
from a capital I, for example.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:03.330
That's another good piece that is
something to look out for helping

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.430
with dyslexia.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Gary> One other
thing that I will add

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.390
to that is it's very important
to build your site in a way

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:14.710
that will allow users to use
their own fonts if they wish to.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:20.590
You shouldn't dictate the actual font
that the user must use on the site.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.580
Allow that flexibility so that
people can use their own fonts

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.420
when they need to
when they have to.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Abbas> Thank you.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.040
I don't know if you could answer this
quickly, and if not, that's okay.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.870
Were there any strong
disagreements between the design

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.200
and accessibility
during the process?

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.670
If there were, how did you handle
them and what was the outcome?

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.560
<v Gary> That's a great question.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.400
Very quickly, Stephen,
you can maybe jump in there.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.160
I don't recall many
because we were the client.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:58.420
It was very important for our
design firm that we chose to listen

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.220
to our feedback.

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.300
We did have some discussions about
pros and cons of different things,

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.060
especially color.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.790
In the end, I think our arguments
went out most of the time.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:17.670
<v Stephen> I would say more
troubleshooting in order to get

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:21.710
to the best end results.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.560
A lot of back and forth maybe
that way, but I don't know

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.820
if I'd necessarily
call them arguments.

00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:31.210
<v Abbas> Happy to hear that.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:34.210
With that, I'm going to conclude.

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.340
I want to thank everybody
for attending the session

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.170
with Gary Aussant
and Stephen Plummer.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.600
You can continue the conversation
in the chat or on social media,

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.210
and please use the
hashtag #WPA11Y Day.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:51.760
It's WPLI Day and WPAD 2022.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.200
We'd also appreciate if you go
to wpaccessibility.day/feedback

00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:02.370
to provide any anonymous feedback
for our speakers on the presentation.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.550
You can also enter to win a
t-shirt while you're there.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.140
Coming up in the next
hour, we're going

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.280
to have growing accessibility
in our WordPress community

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.250
with Sumner Davenport, Alicia St.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.940
Rose, Joe A. Simpson Junior,
Ron Amick, and Sally Thoun,

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.720
that's at 2000 UTC.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.310
While you're waiting,
you can visit our sponsor pages,

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.320
get some virtual swag,
and enter a chance for great prizes.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.860
Please, refresh your browsers at
the beginning of the live stream

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.820
for the next hour.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:35.550
