00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Jay McKay> Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.660
My name is Jay McKay and I'm the
Director of Community Programs

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.320

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.460
Thank you for joining us for
Pssst, hey, you!

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.140
Not everyone likes videos!

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.210
with Michele Butcher-Jones.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.390
Michele is a lover of
all things Open source,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.000
a WordPress core contributor,

00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:33.693
<v Michele Butcher-Jones>
Good morning,

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.640
good evening, good afternoon.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800
Hello everybody.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.440
I hope everyone so far
has enjoyed the day.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.440
It's evening where I'm at
now, and we kick this off.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.270
To start, I already gave
my little introduction

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.220
of I'm Michele Butcher-Jones.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.992
I live in Southern Illinois
about five hours south

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.050
of Chicago land area.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.890
Already went through
everything I do.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.390
I'm also a volunteer for the WordFest
Live that should be happening here

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.560
in a little while.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.620
Then my day jobs,
I am the head of support specialist

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.930
at Thrive Agency, and then
I also do content management

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.270
for Cornell University.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.880
Anymore, there are videos everywhere
on social media, on websites,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.560
people will send you videos
and they are just everywhere.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.630
There's a huge allure of videos
from TikTok to YouTube to Facebook,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.010
almost all of your social
media platforms now have

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.440
some kind of video streaming.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.710
According to Cisco, now videos
count for 82% of all web traffic.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.190
The two biggest areas right
now of YouTube and Facebook,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.880
say they have over billions
of views every single day.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.290
Video content is very supreme
right now, when it comes

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.350
to the social media
and on your websites.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.860
You see drone videos now
covering locations of businesses

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.370
and many get to know us videos and
unboxing videos from influencers.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.310
Why do people love them?

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.650
The joke of all the
cool kids are doing it.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.310
Then now there's this huge
wave of the influencer culture

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.350
and so many people who go from
having this idea of they love makeup,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.120
so why not make videos of
learning how to put the makeup on

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.270
and what products work for
them, what products don't work.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.080
Then video is great for boosting your
SEO to get the Google gods happy.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.320
Then there are relatively easy to
make, if you're only making videos,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.300
but when you're only making videos,
then they're not very accessible.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.110
When it comes to them not being
accessible or just other reasons,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.570
not everyone likes videos.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.580
I tend to actually be one of them
who don't really care for videos.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.180
My ADHD brain, even paying
attention to sitting in a movie

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.610
without playing on my phone or
doing a little something else,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.360
I tend to lose interest in it.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.950
Right now,
just in the United States alone,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.840
13% of the population has
some sort of disability.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.809
With the disabilities of
being hearing impaired

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.212
or visually impaired,
or even just cognitive differences

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:18.460
can be a huge hurdle when it
comes to just watching videos.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.990
Some people dislike
being talked to.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.150
For a lot of the Facebook Live videos
when they first started talking,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.440
you would have a video of just
someone sitting in there with a phone

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.550
like this just talking,
and it's almost like FaceTime,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.410
except for it's a one-sided talk.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.000
For those with me personally,
two minutes, not even two minutes in,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.770
and I'm just like,
okay, this is boring.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.560
Then sometimes the content
can be very hard to comprehend

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.670
if you have someone who is
talking really fast or talking

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.730
with an accent that you're
not completely used to.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.560
There are those type of
videos, you see them,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.360
especially on like Facebook where
it's look what happened-type video

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.670
and/or they're cooking
and they check the pot

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.550
for three minutes instead of
just showing you the dish.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.680
Quite often,
even without a disability

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.340
or different type of brain patterns,
you can get really impatient

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.270
with that.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.870
Then also the quality of the video,
and with quality of the video,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.440
there's the sounds,
how clear people are talking.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.700
There is also like a bunch of
background noise and visual aspects

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.090
of it because some can be fuzzy.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.460
Like if they're using their phone
to record and they've got a smudge

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.620
on the lens, it can show
bad quality for the video,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.920
and then people might
not want to see it.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.620
In other non-accessible issues that
don't have to deal with like sound

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:06.480
and vigil, is there's also all
the advertisements all the time.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.910
Right now,
if you're in the United States,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.210
we're getting ready next Tuesday
to have our midterm elections,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.500
and so with Facebook especially,
there's so many political ads.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.780
They're just all the time.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.710
You can watch a eight-minute
video with a girl talking

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.980
about Egyptian history and there
could be seven different videos

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.150
in that five-minute video ads
talking about the elections.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.430
Sometimes it's the same
ad over and over again.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.110
Then also on more YouTube
than the other ones,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.240
you have the subscriber pressure,
like, click here, please click here,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.240
please follow me here.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.840
Every so often, even if you were
able to keep attention to the video,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.300
the every, like a minute or
two saying, click this button,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.460
so prescribe here, don't miss
out, can break your thought on it.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.640
Then again, of just not
having a clear point to it.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.260
Then too much fluff can
make people lose interest.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.590
Even as adults and then
children also, there is a limit

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.160
to how much cognitively
you can spend on something.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.770
Typically for a toddler to school
age, it's a minute per year.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.300
A two-year-old typically
only has about two minutes

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.730
of attention they can spend
on any particular thing.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.600
Even as adults,
we tend to have that same repertoire

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.162
where there's only so many minutes

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.170
that something can
keep us interested,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.250
especially if we're
not interested in it.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.340
Then there's also different video
conflicts that can happen as well

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.410
because there's no one size fits
all solution that comes for SEO,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.360
that comes for a website
builds, it comes from clothing,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.430
it comes from everything.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.410
We're just not a one size
fits all type of world.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.800
When it comes to accessibility,
we always think about the vision

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.790
in audio accessibility,
but there's a broader area for that

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.470
as well that needs to be
included when it comes to videos.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.974
It's your neurodivergent persons

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:44.530
who might need more of grab you-type
attention to keep you interested.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.570
There's the ADHD brain, who if
you're talking about something

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.720
in a very monotone voice and
you're just being kind of boring,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.040
that will also lose the
attention of the video.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.490
Auditory processing disorders.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.980
For me myself, I tend to read
lips to be able to understand more

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.370
with the auditory processing
and that's where I will jump in

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.180
and also say, I want to thank the
WordPress Accessibility Day team

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.800
for having the ASL
interpreters on here.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.520
That is one thing I've always
been very appreciative of

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.810
because I am a little
hard of hearing.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.400
I do read lips and then
also as a preschool teacher,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.700
before I started
working in WordPress,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.170
we would teach our younger
children the basic signs,

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.310
like milk and more,
and please and thank you,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.960
to help them say their needs
before they could vocally do it.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.450
I have an 18 year old daughter
now, who is in college

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.330
and uses a lot of the sign
language still for like,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.780
if you're at a loud
basketball game.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.750
You're trying to get the
person beside you's attention

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.110
because you're wanting
to go get a drink.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.760
You're trying to yell, I want
water and they can't hear you,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.650
but if you tap on their shoulder
and then give the water sign,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.980
they know what you're doing.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.480
With auditory processing,
my daughter also has it as well

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.220
and we have learned with sign and
lip reading, it helps us out a lot.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.330
Then also different
learning disabilities.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.850
There's a mixture of what can
help learn at different stages.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:35.700
You would not have a four-year-old
sit in front of just learning videos

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.660
to learn how to tie their shoes.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.340
Then also,
at just different cognitive levels,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.960
you would want different aids
for helping to learn, which goes

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.300
into that.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.070
There are many different learning
styles and not everyone can learn

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.240
from just videos alone.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.900
Sometimes a person needs more
than one format to let it also in.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.820
Oftentimes, you'll have people
who are just vision learners

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.320
who can do well with videos, but
then you have your auditory people

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.060
who can play the video in the
background, just to hear the sounds

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.950
of the people talking
and soak it all in.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.880
Then you have others who
wants to have a video,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.080
but also have a transcript of
it, so they can listen along to

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.090
what is being done to be shown
what it is, and then go to try

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:40.080
to do it with the
wording, also with it.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.530
Like for my at work, I train our
new project managers on the web team

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:53.960
and we have a system that is,
tell it, show it, shadow it, do it.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.580
There's those four different
steps of doing everything

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.270
and by the time you get
through that four step

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.880
of doing it the first time,
you've absorbed all the information

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.490
to do it,
which makes you more successful.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.490
When you're only having videos
on your website or sharing them

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.060
in social media and you
don't have any text with it,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.440
it can make it very hard for
those people who do not learn well

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440
from videos.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.210
If you must use videos, then I will
admit I do like my videos as well

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.280
on different things
that keep my attention.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.900
I love watching the videos
from WordFast and WordPress.tv

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.240
from the talks of past.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.920
With those though, they have a
lot of options for accessibility

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.680
to make them easier
for people to watch.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.880
Sorry, I had to grab a drink.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:14:00.530
All videos should first include
web friendly text and captions

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.170
and transcripts and then PDFs
that allow for audio playback,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.820
when you share the
information with it.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.960
This is mostly for if you are
sharing them on your website.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.450
Like say, if I took the video
from this talk and posted it

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.490
on Can't Speak Geek
for people to watch.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.210
I would want to have a copy of
the transcript attached to it,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.860
if I was to use the
logos from the sites

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.720
to make sure they have
their alt text behind them

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.550
and the font is very
friendly to read.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.190
Then also making
sure that the slides

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.320
that I used also has web friendly
texts with spacing and easy to read.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:51.380
Then I am a huge fan when it comes
to captions on any type of videos.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.174
My husband and I both
use close captionings

00:14:55.175 --> 00:14:57.760
on our television for movies.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.420
It just makes it easier to be able
to understand what they're saying,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.840
especially when you
have videos and movies

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.800
with a lot of background sounds.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.630
Then also for the PDFs that you
might attach with your videos,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.650
is to make sure that they allow
for the audio playback to happen.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.850
Then going back into a little
bit more of a deep dive of it,

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.500
when it comes to the text in
your videos and on the pages

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.120
that hold them, is make sure
you're choosing easy to read fonts,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.100
that there's large spacing
and that the text is also

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.040
kind of a large font.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:43.130
Because the older you get, the more
harder it is to read smaller print.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.930
Then if you tend to need
bigger ones of the glasses,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.140
those also might make it harder
for you to read smaller fonts.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:01.000
Then also avoid animations in your
text because of with animations,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.760
or like back in the late
'90s when the [inaudible]

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:13.840
words were very popular and
they would have moving texts

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.890
that's really hard for text readers
to grab onto and read in general.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.410
Then also keep in mind of your color
palettes for when you use color

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.980
on text.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.420
Then for backgrounds, remember
for the contrast and highlights

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.870
for important information,
so that it can stand out more

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.870
for the reader.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.710
Also, when you're using the icons
and color contrasting in good fonts,

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.830
it makes it so much easier
for your screen readers.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.690
Then with your videos, make sure
to always have the captions made

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.770
during your live videos.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.460
It's really nice with
YouTube that they do have

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.500
a speech recognition technology.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.500
However, with YouTube and
Vimeo and many of the others,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.390
it's a good start and you should
definitely go through and revise it

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.820
to ensure that it is correct.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.510
The best way to also do that as
well, is have a script

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.800
that you have written out
before you do your video

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.950
that has everything that
is supposed to be said.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.140
Once the video's done and
you have to go back in

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:38.190
and look at what the YouTube
speech recognition picked up,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.550
it makes it easier to
switch the words out.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.300
A lot of times when it
comes to the recognition,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:52.530
it picks up your normal words,
but if you tend to use slang

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:59.130
or have a thicker accent,
or not enunciate very well,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.670
it won't pick it up as well.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.700
For us, people who are in the south
or even more southern than I am

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.840
with the yous in the
y'all and words like that,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.710
it tends to not pick
them up as well.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:22.810
The also with the video captions,
they will not only pick up your words

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.000
when done right, but it will
also pick up all the sounds

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.290
and turn them into text.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.580
If you're making a little commercial
type video of your business,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.220
then one of the things you
want is someone walking in

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.940
through the door and you hear
the ding dong of the bell

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.000
that it will pull it in there too.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.220
When people who are having
auditory needs won't just hear

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.330
the person talking,
but they'll be able to read

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.080
that the doorbell dinged
and a person walked in,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.480
which makes it even more
engaging to the person

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.740
who is doing speech detects.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.440
Now there are two different
types of captioning.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.180
There's your closed captionings,
which those are encoded in

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.280
with the video,
so it's all one file.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.490
Then you have the open
captions, which are a decoded

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.540
from an existing subtitle
file, and that's usually made

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.990
by a third party service.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.060
For that, it could be
whichever one you prefer,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.250
but typically code
captions work the best

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.250
if you are doing all
of this manually.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:37.910
Then one of the things I love
the most about meeting videos

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:43.680
and also training videos,
is to have a transcript to go along

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.770
with it.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:50.680
A transcript is it takes all the
captions and and prints it out

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.910
into a dialogue that
makes it searchable.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.330
For that,
I'm one who if I do have to listen

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:04.730
to a little meeting video,
I will put it on like speed 1.5

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:10.940
to 2 to go through it quickly,
or if it does come with a transcript,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.340
I more look at that and find where
I need, and then will go back

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.720
to the video at that
particular time point.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.100
It helps because one, you don't
have to keep up with what's

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:29.810
on the screen, especially in like
meeting videos, you want to skip

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:34.320
through the hi, hellos, introductions
and go down to where, oh,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.630
we need to figure out about
building the homepage.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:42.120
Let me skip ahead to that
information and then they go talking

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.460
into SEO parts, and if you're the
developer, you don't need to know

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.720
about that,
you can skip ahead until it goes

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.980
into the next information.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.190
For transcripts, it's like reading a
book instead of watching the movie.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.090
I am one who's more into
the reading the books

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.780
than watching the movie because,
shhh, they're always better.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.710
Then audio descriptions here
and there and everywhere.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:20.020
This goes for images and scenes
and videos through narrations,

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.910
and who doesn't like
a good narrator?

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:30.830
We joke around about having
the little quizzes that says,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.980
which Marvel character
will narrate your life

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:43.910
or which deep voice
will narrate yours voice

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.280
or which Muppet could
describe your life?

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.190
We all do enjoy the having
the narration and it does help

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.770
with transcribing everything
to audio, but it also helps

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.410
with visually impaired.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:05.060
The more descriptions you can
give, the more adjectives and verbs

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.480
and buildup you can get, the more
a person can imagine in their head

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.100
if they cannot see it visually.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.530
We notice this in books
that we could read.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.480
Like for myself,
I'm a huge murder mystery lover.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.370
There's a writer
named Brian Freeman,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.600
who actually just put
out a book yesterday

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.050
that I haven't started reading yet
because I haven't had a chance.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.470
In his books, he is so
descriptive with this scenery,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.650
with the people, that you can
just see it all in your head.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.130
In another example is I've
always been a huge Dan Brown fan

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.680
who has done the books and the
movies of like DA VINCI CODE

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:57.640
and Angels and Demons, the religious
fictional history type books.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.570
Let's see, who was it?

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:04.290
Was it Tom Hanks
who played in that?

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.580
Yes.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.460
With his books were so descriptive,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:14.080
that the first time I saw the first
movie he did was DA VINCI CODE.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.060
While I didn't picture
some of the people

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:23.650
who actually played those characters
as them, but the places a lot

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.440
that he did and some of
the people descriptors

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.980
because he was so vivid in
his legible descriptions,

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.840
that in my head I pictured a lot
of it and it was very close on.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.670
That happens with also when
you have the audio happening

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.760
with your descriptions.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.027
An extended audio with
giving the descriptions

00:23:49.028 --> 00:23:53.120
can give the small details of
every single little action frame.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.280
That just turns your video in
a way into a really good book.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.640
They can help close the gap between
what is happening on the screen

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.590
and what the viewer understands.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.570
Especially when if someone
can see a little bit,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:14.200
but it's more blurry, but also
has all the audio descriptors,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.020
it really can put it all together.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.420
For the visually impaired,
the more description,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.570
the more they can see
with their imagination.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.160
Then on the technical side,
when it comes to video formats

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.430
and players, you'll want
to make sure you are using

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.780
the best formats possible
for accessibility.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.630
Typically, that is the MP4.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.310
Then also for the accessible
for the vision impaired

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.430
and other accessibility
items, if you use more of

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.650
like the Windows version or
different things like that,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.420
then you're making the other people
who say like, if you haven't made

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:07.800
on Windows, using their media viewer
and you're an Apple computer user,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.060
you would have to download the
Windows media player to be able

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.060
to watch that video.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.930
Now, most of the time, Vimeo and
YouTube does this automatically

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.500
for making everything accessible.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:27.200
Then using a WordPress site makes it
easy for you to embed those videos.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.600
After the videos makes it also easy
for you to embed your transcripts

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.900
and text in there afterwards.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.420
It's all one nice package
together on your page.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.370
Then for making the
videos and editing,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:48.420
products like your Adobe Premier
Pro can help you get your videos

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.240
of good quality and also
make them accessible.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.080
Then there's some random other
thoughts for when it comes to sounds,

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.180
to make them accessible.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:06.450
That's easy to do, is number
one, speak slow and clear

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.950
and then also show
your speaker's face.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.790
Often, when it comes to
your auditory people,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.160
is when you have someone talking
like this and looking away,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.860
you can't really hear them.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.820
It's like the opposite
version of you driving

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.960
and you turn the radio down to
make sure you don't get lost.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.660
Is that being able to see
it, to be able to hear it.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.470
Then block out white noise
when you're doing your videos.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:51.140
So if you are wanting to record
outside and there's a white

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.460
outside humming or if
you're in an office

00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:00.410
and there's a bunch of just the not
really chatter towards distracting,

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.600
but just your little noises
rubbing back and forth.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.440
Then try to avoid
using filler words.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.180
This is the one thing I try
the most on as a speaker,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.770
but still sometimes
have issues with.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:18.820
The filler words are your
ums, your uhs, your huhs, uh

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.560
and they are fillers to save area.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:32.980
Also, have a narrator to help you
with the background audio in it.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.230
Have a non-distracting background.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.430
How many times especially back in

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.880
when more local radio stations
were bigger than they are now,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.880
and they would do the live radio
events and you would have the,

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.140
hi, my name is Michelle
Jones and I'm coming to you

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.920
from our local grocery store.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.910
Those were just audio,
but even in videos now

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.210
where you have the person
talking at the grocery store,

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.670
but you have all the noise of
the carts coming back and forth

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:10.520
and maybe a child screaming in the
background or a husband talking

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.180
to the wife, to where you're hearing
all of these surrounding noises

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.190
around that one person
trying to talk about being

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.970
at the grocery store.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:25.240
You have a hard time trying to
stay pinpointed on the lead person

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.840
because of all of that
distracting background noise.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.480
Then some random other thoughts
to do for your visuals, is again,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.940
nothing blinking
flashing or strobing.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.030
This is big for anyone
who has epilepsy,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:50.020
but it's also very beneficial
for if someone has vision issues

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:55.340
and where it is their
sensitive to light and anything

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.620
like real bright flashing, especially
if you're the type of person

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.830
to use the dark views
on your monitors.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.240
If you have a dark view
and you start a page

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.060
and all of a sudden there's this
glowing blinking thing coming at you,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.230
it can take your eyes a minute to
adjust and it can really hurt them

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.110
if you have very sensitive eyes.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.020
Then also with the
flashing and strobing,

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.560
that can be just very
distractive as well

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.680
and the audio cannot pick those up.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.270
Then another thing that is
really thought of quite often,

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.420
is the smooth
movements of a camera.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:41.390
If you watch like the Blair Witch
movies, where they're running

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.210
through the woods and the videos
are just jumping everywhere,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.000
it's hard to keep
attention with it.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.810
It's hard to really convey
what's going on in the video

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.120
because of the movement.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.920
Also, it could just
create motion sickness

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.210
for some people watching it,
if they have a sensitive stomach.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.450
The smoother you can make
the movements of the camera

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:09.990
and the ease of use of just
going through everything,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.200
it makes it a lot easier.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.700
Then remember your color contrasting
when it comes to making videos,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.380
especially if you're
using a green screen.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.820
For example,
there was a couple of years ago

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:29.620
where Queen Elizabeth was wearing
a green outfit in one of her,

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.080
I think it was Christmas talks maybe,
or just when she was addressing

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.710
the UK.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.600
They were turning it into all
different kinds of coverups

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.610
because of green
screen with her outfit.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:48.520
There's been different times where
meteorologists doing the weather

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.400
on TV would wear a green outfit
and when they would walk up

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.960
to the map, they would
disappear except for their head

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.960
and their hands.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.050
That's with green screen for the
color contrasting, but then also,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.390
say, if you're wearing a white
shirt like I am, and you go

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:10.190
to put on the WP Accessibility
banner, because I'm in white

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.420
and the background is in
white, I pretty much disappear.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:24.570
If you are mindful of when you go
into different types of settings

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.360
for your videos, you would
want yourself to stand out more

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.690
for showing the people and not just
blending back with one another.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.910
Give it a minute.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.970
We'll wait to switch over for ASLs.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.240
That was perfect timing.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.000
Other factors for
accessible videos?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.190
Because there's more than just
accessibility for the democracy

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:04.400
of media, other wins for having the
accessible videos is one the obvious

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.410
of being inclusive
reaching all audience,

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:12.390
both ones with accessible needs
and ones who just like using

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.310
the accessible needs.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.010
Kind of like with me

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:20.720
on actually really enjoying
watching ASL interpreters talk.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.880
Sometimes I'm not having
auditory dislocation issues,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.360
but I still like using
the closed captionings.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.820
Also videos, especially accessible
videos, improve SEO scores.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.590
Of course, we always like appeasing
Google to be that number one

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.590
on their searches.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.070
Videos can also help
with ease of use

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.530
of your website when
they're accessible,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:51.670
because if you are having an
informative site where you're wanting

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.390
to teach different
type of lesson plans,

00:32:54.390 --> 00:33:01.610
if you have the video plus your
slides, that go through the video

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:06.200
and a transcript of it, all of those
things together will help people

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.150
learn better on your site.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:18.270
The most attention-getting of
your wallet is the more accessible

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.990
your videos are,
the more accessible your website is,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.750
the lower chances you are of
a legal complaint with the ADA

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.050
because that is something
nobody wants to get into

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.720
because lawsuits now for
ADA can cost a lot of money.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.130
For the bad side of it, it's cheaper
just to make yourself ADA compliant.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.650
Then I wanted to throw in
some helpful links that I had.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.950
Some of the information that I
have in here today was grabbed

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:57.680
from these links and also just
ones to have around, of course,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.960
going into the WCAG
Accessibility standards.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.040
Found Ava that is
captionings for all.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.160
That's really cool to see.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.430
In TapTapSee is for
vision appearance.

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:19.070
Then we have for the US
Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.470
Google has their own
Google accessibility,

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:27.880
where you can learn more of
information with working with Google

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.290
for video accessibility.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.890
The Ally Color Contracts
accessibility validator.

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:41.610
For this you can enter colors in and
see if the contrast is good enough

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.270
to be accessible contrast.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.670
Then the BOIA video checklist.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.110
This is actually a
really great checklist

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:54.870
if you're just learning how to
be accessible with your videos

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.260
or wanting to grow to make sure
the videos are fully accessible.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.600
Then the Assisted Technology
Industry Association,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.390
they've got a lot of great
information on there.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.250
It looks like I cut
this six-minute short.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.560
I want to thank everyone
that came to my talk.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.400
I want to thank both of the ASL
interpreters coming to share my words

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.530
with their hands,
and I hope everyone has a great rest

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.240
of their 14 hours we
have, I think, left.

00:35:29.322 --> 00:35:30.570
<v Jay> All right.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.180
Thank you so much, Michelle.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.540
We do have a couple of questions.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.490
This first one, do you have
suggestions that we can use

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.160
for creating transcriptions
to go with our videos?

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.720
Perhaps anything free to use?

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:48.650
<v Michelle> There was one.

00:35:55.554 --> 00:35:57.222
Can't remember the name of it.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.360
Fusebox Transcripts
is another good one.

00:36:07.778 --> 00:36:14.251
Then most of them though,
unfortunately, are paid.

00:36:17.235 --> 00:36:19.940
<v Jay> Oh, we had a
suggestion of Otter, I believe.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.914
<v Michelle> Yes, that was actually
the one I was trying to think of.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.870
I knew I needed to
write those down.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.754
[laughter]

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:30.389
<v Jay> Let's see.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.140
We have another one.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.930
Is there a way to get the slides
without a scribed or script account?

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:35.930
Excuse me.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Michelle> For mine?

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.720
<v Jay> Yes, I believe so.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Michelle> I will actually share
those out at the end of the day--

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.170
not end of day, end of the hour.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.120
Mine will be posting on Twitter,
but if you want to go back

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.480
to my slides in the top
right, there is a link

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:10.360
that is mlb.pw/wpad 2022, which
will take those to Speaker Deck,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.770
they can be downloaded there.

00:37:13.835 --> 00:37:14.543
<v Jay> Great.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.760
This was a question about the MP4.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.660
What is it about the MP4 that is
more accessible to visually impaired,

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.030
than other video formats?

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.870
<v Michelle> It's mostly with, for
the mp4, they are able to be played

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.320
on almost all players.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:42.260
Where your QuickTime and Flash,
yes, they still have Flash around,

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.770
Windows media player tend to only
want to be played on those type

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.650
of media players.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:58.830
Then also the MP3s, it's just like
your like PHP level WordPress levels

00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.400
and stuff.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.690
It is accessible,
but with the newer MP4s,

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.090
it just makes it a bit better and
code is written just a little bit

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.090
more tighter.

00:38:10.477 --> 00:38:10.907
<v Jay> Okay.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.700
We had another one.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:20.110
Do you recommend a particular
plugin for e-commerce sites?

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.405
If it's just the code at
compatibility cross-browser

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.640
and cross-os?

00:38:35.135 --> 00:38:36.680
That might be from
a different session.

00:38:37.149 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Michelle> I think that one, yes.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.752
<v Jay> [laughs]

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:43.350
Oh, here we go.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.510
We have another question
that just popped up.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.110
If you had to choose
between video and audio,

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:53.200
do you think that audio has
a broader appeal than video,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.670
and would be better to just do the
audio and text, rather than video

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.650
and text?

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Michelle> Me personally,
I am an audio and text type person.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.710
With doing this talk, when it came
to looking at the different things

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.360
with accessibility and
for me on personal,

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:20.220
I don't know how many times,
I would have an email that's talking

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.440
about a breakthrough for
diabetes care and I'm like, yes,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.650
let me get to this and it goes
to just a page that is a video,

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:36.800
that's like 32 minutes long,
no transcript, no closed captioning

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.540
and I'm supposed to watch
this thing for, at least,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.470
28 minutes before I can
click on a link to take me

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.900
to what they're actually
selling in the information.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.220
Usually, with those two
minutes in between my ADHD

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.691
and neurodivergent brain, I'm done.

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.510
[laughs]

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.490
But with being a
preschool teacher first,

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:06.270
and then I've taught beginner's
WordPress and then in a trainer

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:12.140
at work for our team, there's so
much more beneficial to the mixture

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.730
of things.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:19.830
I like it so much more where you
can just listen to the audio,

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.270
you can just read or you can do
the video or you can do the mix

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.410
of all three.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.080
If I had to choose, especially
the, I'm just going to stand here

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.970
and talk to my video or
the not have an option,

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.090
give me just the audio.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.090
[laughs]

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.710
<v Jay> I'm exactly the same way.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.923
If it's just going
to be talking at me,

00:40:38.924 --> 00:40:40.860
I'd much rather have a transcript.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.674
I agree with that one.

00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:47.712
I just wanted to give out that
address one more time for the slides.

00:40:47.712 --> 00:40:58.060
It's MLB.PW/WPAD2022.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:06.200
I believe we've also put it in the
ideas tab as well, on the channel.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.610
Oh, next one.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.730
What is your opinion
on background videos?

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.450
Are they very annoying to you?

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.820
Do you see value
in them for others?

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:23.109
<v Michelle> I can see the
appeal in them, but for the love

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:29.090
of everything that is good, do not
make the audio play automatically.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.360
Because how many times,
especially if you've been sitting

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.730
in a quiet room and you go to a
page and it's almost like the clown

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:44.050
from the Garfield Halloween's
episode, where the clown's like,

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:49.250
"Hey, kids," and it feels like
that when you go to these videos

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.450
and all of a sudden just,
well, go to the websites

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.380
and it just sounds crazy.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:01.700
The little short videos in
the header area can be gray,

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:08.470
then also a little moving
background for a gift can be nice.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.990
I just recently looked
at a real estate site

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.580
that had a huge hero section where
behind it, was a drone flying

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.520
through St. Louis,
and it was on a continuous loop.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.820
It never stopped, and if you paid
a little too much attention to it,

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.660
it kind of made you motion sick.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Jay> That's never
a good feeling.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:34.620
Oh, we have another one here.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.100
If we're making a product demo
video that is-- excuse me,

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.500
let me rephrase that.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.920
If we're making a product demo
video, is there a specific style

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.590
of demo videos that
you think works better?

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Michelle> As long as they're
engaging and the person has interest

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:04.850
in it, in really just
authentic engagement in it,

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:11.150
then the demos typically work
better, and it's definitely a talk

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:15.860
about it, show it,
but make it a quick move through.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.010
Because sometimes there are
like, let me give you

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:23.340
these 74 different points that
you're not going to care about

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.180
and then show you how it's going.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:30.070
Were it's more kind of like how
we first learn to write papers,

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:34.020
where you give your intro
blurb, you give the meat,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.940
and then you give
your auto-blurb to it.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.150
Sticking with those types
of concepts for even demos,

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.770
where you give your elevator
speech, do the demo,

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:49.100
answer like a FAQ-type thing at
the end, tends to make it better.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.420
Whereas a lot of
these cooking videos

00:43:53.420 --> 00:44:00.560
or even just the cooking recipe
pages, where you have like 10 miles

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.180
of fluff and then you
finally get to what you want,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.350
and the more of getting what you
want tends to make the demos,

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.270
unboxing any of those
types of videos better.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.790
<v Jay> This is just for me.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.500
I'm curious, in terms of if
you have any advice in terms of

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:24.430
how to maybe script out or plan
your video before you actually get

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.290
to hitting record.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:31.790
<v Michelle> For that, what I've tend
to have done is just build out almost

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:39.790
like a script you would do for
doing a play or even making a movie.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.420
Just do it on a small form
because it might just be you,

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.030
but write out,
especially what you want to say

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.540
and then practice it a bit,
so that you're comfortable

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.860
with the wording of it
and then go into it.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.290
If you're doing something like
this, you can always have the words

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:02.480
on the one side and still be quite
engaging and just glancing over

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.620
for reading it.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.590
Having that all written out, it
makes you not do as many of the uhs

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.460
and ums.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.420
It makes it easier for the
transcribers to pick it up

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.150
and it also makes you look more
confident in what you're saying.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:26.500
Me on the other hand when it comes
to doing talks, I am the queen of,

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.194
you're going to get to my talk and
then about 17 other side stories.

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.131
[laughs]

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Jay> We're going to go on
a journey with you, for sure.

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:37.750
All right.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.560
We have just a few more minutes.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.220
Let's see if we've got any
other questions popping up,

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.200
but I could just chat with
you all day about this

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.090
'cause I find it
absolutely fascinating.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:53.270
I wanted to go back a little bit
too on the background videos.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:54.850
I think you brought
up a really good point

00:45:54.850 --> 00:46:00.300
about that not having the audio
and also about having ways to stop.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.750
Do you have any recommendations for
those autoplay background videos,

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.280
like maybe how long they should
be if they're going to loop

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.110
or any additional
information for those?

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.550
<v Michelle> Well, depending on
how long that video is would depend

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.230
on how long the loop.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:23.020
However, typically,
a person's not going to stay

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.720
on that above-the-fold area more
than about 20 to 30 seconds.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.780
Really, that should be
as long as it will take

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:37.140
and even if it is a little
area down below that's not the

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:43.650
above-the-fold that like say,
you want someone given a thumbs up,

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:49.200
to trying to get someone talked
into signing up for something.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.050
Still typically, any given
area, they don't spend more than

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:55.740
about 20 to 30 seconds on.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.430
Really,
that's as long as it needs to be.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:03.090
Then if you do want it as a
continuous loop for longer,

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.190
you've got to think the
longer that video is,

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.810
the more resources is being
pulled from that site,

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:13.130
which could make the site slower
and then you have even more issues

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.680
than just it being more accessible.

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Jay> All right.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.090
Well, thank you.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:25.350
I'm going to wrap us up,
but please if you have any questions,

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.610
please pop those in
the chat right now.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.890
I want to thank you all
for attending our session.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.780
Actually, not my session,
Michelle's session.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.219
[laughs]

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.240
Hey, you!

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.550
Not everyone likes videos.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.340
