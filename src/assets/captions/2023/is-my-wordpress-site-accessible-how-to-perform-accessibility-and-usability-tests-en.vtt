00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.590
Is my WordPress site accessible?

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.940
How to Perform Accessibility
and Usability Tests,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.350
with Speaker Maria Gabriela Gaby
Gandica, UX Manager at Smartmatic.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.670
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Amanda Roper> Hi everyone.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.220
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.640
My name is Amanda Roper, and I'm
joining you from Philadelphia,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.980
Pennsylvania.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.380
I am the Accessibility Program
Manager at T. Rowe Price,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.340
where I'm responsible
for developing

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.490
and maintaining the accessibility
program across our global teams.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.070
When I'm not solving for
accessibility issues in the world,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.610
you can find me screen printing,
hiking, or in an art museum

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.090
with one of my vintage
cameras by my side.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.680
I'm so excited to introduce
this next speaker for you.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.140
Gaby Gandica is here to talk about,
Is my WordPress site accessible?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.240
How to Perform Accessibility
and Usability Tests.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.940
Gaby is a compassionate and
dedicated UX designer and manager

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.840
with over 13 years of
experience in the tech world.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.500
Gaby has spent the last seven years
honing her skills in UX design,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.790
accessibility, and team management.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.030
Gaby is passionate about
creating user-centric experiences

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.980
that are accessible to all,
and striving for excellence

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.220
in making the digital world a
more inclusive place for people

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.820
with and without disabilities.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.120
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A section

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.740
and we will answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.540
And also use the chat to
connect with other attendees.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.410
Gaby,
the virtual floor is all yours.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.520
 GABY GANDICA: Amanda, thank you.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520
Thank you very much.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.040
Hi guys.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.340
Let me start, of course,
by sharing my screen

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.080
so that we can start
our session today.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.050
I am so excited to be here.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.270
This is the result of a lot of
work from a wonderful community.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.980
So I am really thankful and I am
happy that I get to be here today.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.100
A little bit about me,
complimenting what Amanda said,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.270
I am from Táchira;
that is in Venezuela.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780
I have a dog named Louis Ramon.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.210
And the reason why I mentioned
this is because, of course,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.830
I love him very much,
but he maybe might want

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.940
to make an appearance with a
couple of barks in the background.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.070
So if you hear him,
you know what's happening.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.630
I am a computer science engineer.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.500
I started my career as a
developer, and then I moved

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.360
to quality assurance, and then
I fell in love with usability,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.410
and accessibility.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.710
Today, I am a UX manager.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.650
The industry experience that I have
is related to financial services,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.540
an electoral system and software
that makes sure my customer base,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.080
the users of the things
that we in the team create,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.230
is pretty much everyone.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.420
And that is what has allowed me
to focus on a diverse audience.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.770
So accessibility has become part
of my work and also my life.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.000
I want to take you through these
seven points that I want to share.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.810
They seem like a lot,
but I'm sure we're going

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.480
to have a great session together.

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.267
First, I want to talk
about the universal need

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.920
for accessible websites,
and why we do what we do.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.090
Then I want to mention when
to go beyond guidelines,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.230
so comparing guidelines
versus realities.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.050
An overview of usability testing,
then planning, conducting,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.240
and analyzing the results in here.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.580
I'm going to share with you some
of the tips that I have about it.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.110
Then I'm going to talk about
why this is so important to do

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.130
as a community, to do it together.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.140
I'm going to share some final
thoughts, some resources,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.390
and of course, the quality.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.450
See, I am a quality
assurance engineer at heart.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.630
The questions and
answers at the end.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.670
So let's start.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.440
Why to build WordPress site and
everything basically accessible?

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.770
The universal need
for accessibility.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.520
If you ask me, my first
question, my first thought is,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.120
because it's the right thing to
do, right?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.310
But I am passionate about this.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.100
So when I get myself involved
in all my emotions and the love

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.900
that I have for this,
I remind myself, Let’s go to facts.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.720
Let's ground some
awareness with facts.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.470
So I am listing here some for you.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.090
First, there's one billion of
people living with disabilities;

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.660
and one billion is a number
that we cannot ignore.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.840
This means that 15% to 20%
of the people that live

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.280
in the world live
with a disability.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.990
So one billion for me means a
call to action, that we have

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.950
to take action in this.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.420
Then we have the UN Convention on the
Rise of Persons with Disabilities.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.860
In here, accessibility is not
presented as a luxury or as something

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.510
that would be nice.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.760
It's presented as a human right.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.430
Now, the web as lifeline.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.980
I think we are living every
day more and more in a world

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.530
where the internet, the
connection, and the web is going

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.390
from being a luxury, something
that I might or might not use,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.140
into something essential.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.290
The way we learn, the way we
shop, the way we connect,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.620
the way we build community,
how we access helpers even is going

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.060
to the web.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.890
So it's a necessity.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.950
It's something that’s
essential in everyone's lives.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.800
I say that the importance of
accessibility goes for all ages

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.270
and stages,
and from temporary to permanent.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.460
If we are lucky enough to grow
old, you know,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.180
our senses will start
to work differently.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.620
I am very sure that my mouse or my
keyboard are playing a trick on me.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.090
I think that our future
selves will be really thankful

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.750
that today we are building
accessible WordPress sites.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.900
Also, this is not only about
permanent disabilities, but things

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.060
that happen every day,
and even situations, right?

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.440
The typical example of somebody
carrying a kid, or a broken knee,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.020
you know, these things also need and
benefit from accessible websites.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.130
Finally, it's good for business.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.042
When we create an
accessible WordPress site,

00:07:16.043 --> 00:07:20.540
we are creating a site
that is good, that works well.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.370
And that, of course,
helps you expand reach.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.220
So I say that this is
not only good for society

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.680
because it’s the right thing to do.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.610
It also improves your
presence on the web.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.870
Guidelines versus Realities:
When and why to go beyond.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.440
Guidelines for me are
my starting point.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.850
The Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, I always say

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.880
that it’s a link that you
have to have as a favorite

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.350
or as a home in your browser.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.160
That is our first help.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.040
That is where we learn the solid
ground of everything related

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.820
to accessibility.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.666
These and other
guidelines have helped us,

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:15.860
and the iterations even adapt
to the new necessities of the web.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.500
However, I believe there are
things that are too hard to include

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.534
in a list or in paper,
all the diversity

00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:28.880
and all the spectrum of humanity.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.630
And that is why I believe that there
is a gap between what guidelines do

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.830
for us, don't get me wrong, which
is a lot, but what happens outside.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.280
I have an example of my life
that I always like to share.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.230
I am sharing on the right
side of the slide a picture

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.380
of a parking space for
people with disabilities.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.000
I took this picture a while ago.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.260
Some years ago, I went through
a knee surgery, and this meant

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.490
that I had to walk with support
for three to four months.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:17.620
And when I was able to drive
again, still needing the support

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.860
to walk, I was assigned, of
course, with the parking space

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.270
for people with disabilities
in the building where I work.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.560
This is back in Panama
when I live there.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:34.450
I'll try to describe
the parking space.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.970
On the right side, it has a wall.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.850
It has another little
wall in the front.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.890
And on the left side,
there are two columns.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:54.130
So when you think of this parking
space, it follows all the guidelines.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.640
It has the right color,
the signal is OK.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.560
There’s blue, it has yellow, there's
the icon that we all recognize.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.000
So it is good.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.223
Also, I can tell you,
in that building,

00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:13.640
according to the regulations,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.050
you have to have an amount of
these type of parking spaces,

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.940
according to the
people in the building.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.450
This was also correct.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.380
When I went to use it,
I had to park my car

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.970
with the copilot door facing
what we call the right wall.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.490
Then the front facing
this little wall here.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.680
I got out of my car,
and I had to find a way to walk.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.580
Normally, when you walk with support,
you take a little bit more space

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.760
than the one you usually do.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.820
So I had to find my way
to work this little aisle

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.360
that was created between the
front of my car and the wall,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.850
then go over a step, and then
finally get to the elevators.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.500
The other option was to
open the door of my car

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.570
and walk a really long distance to
be able to get to the elevators.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.120
So what's the gap?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.970
I am sure that the
people that designed

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.280
and built this parking spaces
were following guidelines.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.130
They were making sure that the
things on the paper, the requirement,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.890
was compliant with what they did.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.930
But I am also sure that even
if they had the best intentions

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.470
on their hearts,
they didn't talk to the people

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.330
that would actually use
this type of parking spaces.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.830
After the second day,
I decided to stop using this spot.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.500
I went back to my regular spot,
and it actually was easier to use,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.660
which is a tough reality to accept.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:03.840
So for me, usability testing is the
missing piece between the guidelines

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.300
and the real world.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.870
That is a way that we
can talk to the people

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.980
that would actually use what we
are creating and get their help,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:20.340
their insights, and just create
something that is not only better,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.410
but that actually
solves what people need.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.250
I think that going
beyond guidelines means

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.100
that we can use the power of
humanity, of human connection,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.520
of a conversation to learn and
improve what we are building

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.300
and make it accessible
and really useful.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.800
What are usability testing?

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.270
This is something that I
honestly think is a conversation.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.633
A conversation where
you listen a lot,

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:05.100
observe a lot, and learn, and grow.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.640
I am leaning on the
right side of the slide.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.870
I'm leaning on a diagram that
I think reflects very good.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:20.390
And in a very easy way, what it
means is you have a facilitator that,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.190
most likely, if you're building
the WordPress site, you are going

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.190
to do it.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.200
I will give you suggestions
about the facilitator.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.740
You have a participant and you
have tasks that are performed

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.740
on your WordPress site.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:43.900
While the participant is performing
those tasks, you are observing

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.960
and learning about it.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.300
Then the participants
starts giving feedback,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.200
and this feedback can be verbal,
can be expressions, can be nonverbal.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.270
Why do they matter?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.980
I always start saying to
the people that I work with,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.530
You guys know too much, you're
too smart, and you're too familiar

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.520
with what you're building.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.970
And this is normal,
and this is great

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.700
that we actually care so
much about what we do.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.030
Although, when we come too close
to something, it is very hard

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.170
to start looking for these
missing pieces or the gaps

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.260
between the guidelines
and the real world.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.830
So that is why you have
to call a friend for help,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.710
and that is why I am presenting to
do usability tests in these cases.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.760
Another thing I can share with you
guys, I've been in meeting rooms

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.720
with a lot of really smart,
talented, beautiful people

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.300
that we have our best intentions
at heart, but sometimes we forget

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.060
about this and we start guessing.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.220
Then we go to a spiral of
thoughts, you know,

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.370
out of the best of our hearts,
but we start assuming, guessing,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.510
presenting ideas,
and then we remember, Stop.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.690
We are guessing.
There’s a famous phrase that goes,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.590
When you are not checking,
you are guessing.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.080
Don't guess; check.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.690
Go to your users.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.390
When I start an effort,
the first question that I ask is,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.900
How fast can I talk to the people
that would actually use this?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.440
Then I start planning
my usability tests.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:37.170
I know this is something that
might sound really maybe complex.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.330
What if I am a shy person?
I don't have the tools.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:47.820
I don't have the budget. I guarantee
this is easier than you think.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.990
Just start with your
first usability test.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.150
I'm going to give you
some tips right now.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.900
But this is something that,
like most things in life,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.250
when you practice, you get better.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.640
So let's plan your
first usability test.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.470
I want to do a disclaimer here.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.450
I don't think there's only
one way to do usability test.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.730
I don't think there's one
framework that fits all the needs.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:30.730
This is a proposal that I am deciding
to share with you as a first draft.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.610
You can take this and start
and adopt and adapt the things

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.620
that better work for you,
and iterate, you know, make it yours.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.070
This is something for you to
grab it and make it yours.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.450
The first thing that I suggest
is to define your objectives.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.800
What do you want to learn?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.650
Do you want to learn about
assistive technology?

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.206
Do you want to learn about
the keyboard navigation

00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:57.880
on your WordPress site?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.900
Do you want to test
with screen readers?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.130
What do you want to learn?

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.640
That will help you set your
objectives and have that clear goal.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.230
I also always suggest
to write it down.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:20.050
It's easier when you can, all the
time, have that as a north of what you are doing.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.910
Choose your testing method.

00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:27.435
I mentioned this
because I used to think

00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:32.810
that in-person tests was the way
to go all the time.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:40.810
And then we had the pandemic,
but we were lucky enough

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:48.900
that we were able to continue to work
and to do usability test remotely.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.780
So if you want to start
by doing a remote test,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.910
there are many tools
now such as this one,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:02.310
where we can share our screen, record
the session, turn the camera on.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.710
So it's another option.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.910
So you can choose whether to
do it in person or remote,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.670
and those will be fine.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.210
Then, as a third step,
I suggest to select the participants

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.400
and let them know you.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.260
Selecting the participants might
be a tricky one because, again,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.860
you know,
maybe you are an introvert,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.150
or maybe you feel like you don’t
know people that can help you.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.610
This is why the community
is so important.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.620
This is a beautiful community.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.233
Reach out to the people,
make connections,

00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:42.540
a post on the blog sites:

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.900
I need help. Do you know somebody?
Can you help me

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.710
with these tests that I want to do?
The reason

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:54.140
why I said let them know you is
because, for me, it always works

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.110
to call the participant before
beginning the session to explain

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.780
how the test is going to be.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.390
I mentioned I am from Venezuela.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.900
I know you know I have an accent.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.450
Sometimes my English is not the best,
so I try to let the participant get

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.890
to listen to me if
they speak English.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.590
So it gets comfortable.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.710
We can create some report.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.810
Also, if they have any concern
regarding the session, any questions,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.400
we can solve those in
that introduction call.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.770
And then when we get to the
actual session of the test,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.770
it’s going to be great.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.890
Now, next, as number four:
Choose the right tools.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.280
Just make sure that what you
want to test in your goal,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.340
what you want to learn,
you are able to get to that

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.050
with the settings that you have.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.600
If the session is in-person,
in your environment,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.790
make sure that the participant has
the right tools to perform the test.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.450
Prepare the environment,
make sure that everything is

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.620
as real as possible,
always taking care of the participant

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.790
being in a comfortable set.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.690
Let's try to always
make that a priority.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:22.900
And after that, make sure that you
have the lighting that is related

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:29.630
to that, if it is on a
desk or if it is standing.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.780
So depending on what
you're needing to test,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.230
I suggest you prepare
an environment.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.080
Design the scenarios.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:45.130
Pick the core task, the most
important task from your site,

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.210
and prioritize the
testing of those.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.390
Determine metrics.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.200
What do you want to measure?

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.100
Do you want to measure
completeness of tasks?

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.530
Is it important?

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.490
Is it time sensitive?

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.810
Do you want to measure time?

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:09.190
Do you want to have a qualitative
questionnaire at the end?

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.340
So make sure you know what you
want to measure so that it is clear

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.680
and you can compare,
not only between participants,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.990
but also between iterations.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.950
Of course, plan for feedback.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.650
When you do usability tests,
you want to be listening

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.680
as much as you can to the
participants and learning.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.470
At the end, usually, the participant
would like to expand more,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.340
maybe, and share about
the overall experience.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:47.180
I have this anecdote where
the task was really difficult

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.950
for the participant.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.690
But what the overall system
did was so good for them

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.710
that they were, like, Look,
you have to fix this and this.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.380
But the concept is perfect.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.130
It's great.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.248
I really would use it.

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:09.060
So I think that final
conversation is very good,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.740
and it's a little debrief that
you do without losing the momentum

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.340
so every idea is fresh
for the participant.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.310
Now, for conducting the test,
I have some best practices

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.180
that have worked for
me in my everyday work.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.550
First is to follow a script.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.260
And this is because
you can get nervous.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.130
Sometimes the participant,
you know, can make jokes.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.830
You can have something in
common, like your sports team.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.450
In my case, I have to
admit, it's very easy for me

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.030
to go through different
conversations.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.250
So I have a script.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.120
I mentioned this
to the participant.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.610
I say, you know, I am following
a script in case you perceive

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.720
that I am fixating too much
into this, but I just want

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.470
to make sure that we do the
test as fast as possible.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.470
Stay neutral.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:14.280
Also, try to intervene the least
that you can during the test.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.980
And in the script, you can
help yourself by writing notes,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.710
like avoid guiding questions,
avoid to mention this

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.920
so that you do not interfere in
what the participant is doing.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.400
Reassure and clarify roles.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.200
Every time we talk
about testing something,

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.080
we get a little bit
anxious, and it's normal.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.420
So just say to the participant.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.690
I am here for you. We are not
testing you. You are helping me

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.400
with whatever you find.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.020
If we find a problem,
it's actually a gift,

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.780
because now I know something that I
didn't know before and I can fix it.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:58.770
So just make sure that they know
that this is a really different,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.860
nice type of test.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.090
Anticipate and handle
technical issues.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.580
Things can happen,
and things will happen.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.490
I have a quick example.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:14.420
I was prepared with my Bluetooth
set, and yesterday they decided

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:22.110
to retire, not to work anymore,
so I have to turn to this today.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.730
So things happen.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.070
So be prepared, make a list.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.290
Also, the good thing is that
when you leave something,

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.870
you can add it to your plan B.
So be always prepared

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:39.050
in case a connection fails
or if something happens,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.880
and the participant will
be very thankful for this.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.340
Encourage expressive feedback.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:50.080
Again,
we are so different and diverse.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.100
There's people that will mention
things, give you suggestions,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.360
talk all the way through it,
or express all the way through it.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:04.850
I suggest that just in case the
participant is not very expressive,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:10.720
remind them in a kind way that
they will help you very much.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.570
Active note-taking when possible.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.440
And if you can, record the test.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.260
I have here on the right
side an example of a practice

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.040
of a usability test
that we were doing.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.820
I blurred the system
that we were testing.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.640
But this is just to show the
quick setup that we can have

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.160
in a remote test.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.020
This is using teams of Microsoft.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.890
Record the test.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.260
In that part, I want to mention
that you will always have

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.350
to talk to the participant and
make sure that there's consent.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.440
It's very easy to
write down a document

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.070
where the participant
accepts the recording.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.190
And then when you also
commit, like, let's say,

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:03.200
I'm not going to share this
recording outside the research team.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.140
So this is a nice commitment
to have in these cases.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.740
Capture diverse data.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.410
Don't look at the timing of the
task, and the final comments

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:22.110
of the participant,
and then the feedback.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.020
If you have a questionnaire,
the final feedback, don't look at it

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.070
as separate things, but look
at it as something together.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.950
So don't divide how you analyze.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.730
Always keep the big
picture present.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.930
Be flexible.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.500
I mentioned every
participant is unique.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.230
Sometimes you will have to adapt
to some different situation.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.950
It's going to be OK.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.130
If you have a script that is going
to help you with being flexible,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.810
but also keeping the first
important guideline next to you.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.460
Finally, wrap up with care.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.150
Be mindful of the
participant's time.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.570
Thank them.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.050
Compensation is always good,
if you have the possibility

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.300
to have a gift card,
or to be a volunteer

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.500
in something the participant
is working on or cares about.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.410
Being thankful is always
something good and appreciated.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.550
When analyzing the
results, what to look for.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:31.050
I'm sharing a wall
with Post-it on it.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.950
It’s as an image on the right side.

00:27:35.192 --> 00:27:38.317
When you're testing for
accessibility, for me,

00:27:38.326 --> 00:27:39.920
that's the first thing.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.290
Find out what the accessibility
insights that you gather

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.790
from your sessions with your
different participants are.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:53.500
The reason why I use Post-it is
because you can find patterns easily.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.920
And then you can also see the
dimension of each one of those

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.950
and prioritize using the
severity of it, right?

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.860
If you have a blocker, something
that is preventing the participant,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:10.640
the people, the user from actually
completing the most important thing,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.080
whether that's a task, or getting
information, or printing something,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.000
just make sure that you
put that as a priority,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.700
and finding those patterns
will help you with that.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.010
A tricky one,
objective versus subjective feedback.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.360
It's very easy to get into a
conversation, you know, because,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.830
again, we are building
this with the community.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.988
And sometimes participants
will express things

00:28:34.989 --> 00:28:36.600
that don't prevent them

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.910
from doing the task or is nothing
related to the actual accessibility

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.370
or usability,
but about personal preferences.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.850
So just be aware
that it can happen.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.870
It's perfectly fine.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.820
It's OK.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.320
Your job is to separate
which one is which.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.620
Be aware of the verbal
and nonverbal cues.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.730
There are many things that you
can do when you have this mindset

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:10.660
of gathering things from every
interaction of the participant.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.960
You may not believe this,
but sometimes you're so focused

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.640
on everything else that
you forget to actually mark

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.970
if the participant completed
the task successfully.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.490
So I always put this when
you're analyzing their result:

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.910
including the report, you know,
the completion of the task,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:33.570
because it's something that sometimes
is so obvious that we missed.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.490
The time on the
task when analyzing.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.550
This is some of those
things that really depends.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:50.250
Maybe it's not time-sensitive,
but if you have a pattern

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:55.360
of people spending a lot of time
in a task, maybe it's not usable,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.680
maybe it's too complex.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.950
Reporting.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.280
There's the CIF, the Common Industry
Format for Reporting Usability

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.860
and Accessibility
Test, which is great.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:10.830
If you can, write it down, put it
on Post-it, write it in your blog,

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.190
you know, report what you
found, the severity.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:19.260
That is like a timestamp on this
version of your WordPress site,

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.260
and then you can
compare as you iterate.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.980
So always report it,
and you will learn more too.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.670
Why is it so important for
me to have accessibility

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.240
and usability tests as
something in my community?

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.300
I believe that usability
tests, the ones focused

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.530
on accessibility particularly,
creates a partnership

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.490
that really just sparks
in the community.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.070
There's a lot of impact in
this type of collaboration.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.950
First, we humanize tech.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.670
We start thinking about
technology as something

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.370
that must be user-center designed.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:08.200
We put the user, the human
there, as the cornerstone,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.310
as the first step of what we do.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.730
We learn and grow.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.400
Everything you learn with each
test that you do will stay

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.460
with you forever.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.150
So by definition, everything that
you do from there on is going

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:28.810
to be better, and it's going
to be stronger, and it's going

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.880
to be more and more accessible.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.150
Maybe for this test that you did,
you tested the keyboard navigation;

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.600
but for the next one, you are
able to test something different.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.460
So now you have more
robust things to include,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.430
and this creates an
inclusive society.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:52.410
I strongly believe that everything
that we do, with the community, not necessarily

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.760
for the community, but with the
community, for sure, will be

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.560
of help for everyone that
is involved and that is part

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.230
of that community.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.910
Some final thoughts.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:11.130
One test that you do, only one,
is better than doing no test at all.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:19.970
If you're hesitant or nervous, or you
don't know how to start, volunteer.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.560
Volunteer as a participant in
other people's usability test.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.630
That way, you are on the other
side and you can take notes

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.480
on what works for you.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.680
This is a journey.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.250
This is not a destination.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.160
Enjoy every iteration.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.190
Enjoy every frustration.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.960
Enjoy every connection that you
make, everything that you learn.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.580
Don't see it as a place
that you have to get to.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.070
See it as something that is
improving the way you live your life.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.060
Some resources here.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.430
There's a great book by Steve Krug.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.760
It's called Don't Make Me Think.
They have a chapter about

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.330
how to make usability tests.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.210
And it's called something like
10 cents usability test is

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.400
to highlight that you don't
need a lot of budget to do this.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.680
At the end of every test,
I suggest you use some tool

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.540
like the System Usability
Scale, which is a great tool

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.190
for measuring usability; and it's a
standard, so people would know it.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.750
Two favorites for your browser:
Web Accessibility Initiative,

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.660
Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.890
These are our best friends.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.420
I know that when you look for
information about usability,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.710
accessibility, user experience,
it might be overwhelming.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:45.810
So just grab what you
need and make it yours.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.150
I usually suggest to people to
go to the Nielsen Norman Group.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.950
I find that their
information is very usable.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.850
So I suggest that.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.920
Also, contrast checkers,
tools that help you view

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.590
if your WordPress site is accessible
or not, these are always a win-win.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.080
You can always reach out to
me, contact me.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.640
I am passionate about this.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.090
I love it.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.640
And I am very lucky that
I get to do what I love.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.550
So my LinkedIn,
you can find me as MaGabrielaG.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.520
And there's my email as
well, MaGabrielaG@me.com,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.310
with only one L.
This has been great.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.190
Thank you very much to
everyone that made it possible.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.910
And I don't know if
we have any questions.

00:34:41.756 --> 00:34:45.299
 <v Amanda> Thank you, Gaby, for that
masterclass in usability testing.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.460
It is now time for
the audience Q&amp;A.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.910
If you haven't had the
chance to put your question,

00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:55.420
you are welcome to add
that into the Q&amp;A section.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:03.770
And I am going to go ahead and
just ask the first question.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.380
During the ‘planning
period,’ you spoke

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:15.390
about choosing the most
important scenarios on a site.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:21.180
Could you speak more about how
to do this?  <v Gaby> Absolutely.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:27.410
Let's say that you have a
system where you have to log in,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:32.230
and the most important thing that
you have to do is to print reports,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.990
right?

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.520
But you also can personalize
the experience of your user,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.404
change your username,
and all of these things related

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:42.770
to administration.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:49.010
In that case, I would first of
all test that the participant,

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.690
the user, the people can actually
find reports and print reports.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:00.710
To do that, I have to, myself,
prior to the start of the test,

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:07.300
log in and do some things in the
administrative task so that it is OK

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.020
to start from a point of a
particular task, so that we make sure

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.130
that we test what is the
most important thing.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.380
And then we go with
the fewer priorities.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.500
 <v Amanda> Wonderful.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.930
Thank you.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.110
Another question that
Anonymous had submitted is:

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.120
You talked about the
report on a slide.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.067
Where or what is this?

00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:36.070
 <v Gaby> Yes.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.590
The report is that this is a test

00:36:39.591 --> 00:36:44.409
where you will learn many
things, right?

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:49.930
So the report is the
summary of what you did.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.670
I wanted to have this goal.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.630
I wanted to learn this.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.710
I selected these participants.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.870
This is the characteristics
of my participants.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.910
This is the task,
the scenarios that I wanted to test.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.290
This was my environment.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.660
These are the metrics.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.150
You list everything on the test.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.590
Then, This is what I learnt.
These are my findings.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.730
I decided to
prioritize it this way.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.660
And these are the things
that I will fix first.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.300
So it's like a summary
of what you did.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.620
It's like taking a picture of all
the efforts that you're making

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.520
so that you first have it, right?

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.040
We cannot measure
what we don't have.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.750
We cannot improve
what we don't measure.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.810
So you will have it there.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:41.480
Also, you can use it as a
communication tool within your team,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.600
your organization,
because these are facts, you know.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.060
It’s not that, I think that
maybe this is not accessible.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.940
I know for a fact,
because 70% of the participants

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.270
couldn't complete this task.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.500
It’s also a picture
for you to compare.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.600
You go, you improve what
you have to improve.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.380
You do more testing,
and you compare the first version

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.600
versus the second version.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.130
So the report is to take a
picture in the form of a report,

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.040
a presentation.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.110
If you Google,
The Common Industry Format

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:19.700
for Usability Testing
is a great way to do it.

00:38:23.752 --> 00:38:25.240
 <v Amanda> Thank you.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.200
Another question, moving along,
is: Is it a good idea to ask

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.930
at the end of the engagement
how you did as a tester,

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.090
and what the feedback might be?

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.020
Or is that not professional?

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.040
It would help testers become more
competent and provide more value

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040
to the clients.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.250
 <v Gaby> It's perfectly good.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.830
I suggest you do it on a survey.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:54.800
You can do it on a paper
survey, on an accessible link

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.420
for the participants.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.940
If you have help depending on
your team or a friend of yours,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.640
you can have another
station with a device ready

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.190
to take that final thoughts.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.110
Just to prevent the
participants to feel, you know,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:13.700
maybe you were talking too
fast, and they want to say that,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.170
but they don't want
to make you feel sad.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.230
Because I have learned that
participants are so great

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:23.070
that they have you in their minds.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.560
So just make sure that it's
something that is anonymous.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.800
Some people will do it because they
want to, but it's not unprofessional

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.580
in my opinion.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.380
I would always request also
feedback of me as a facilitator.

00:39:39.234 --> 00:39:40.190
 <v Amanda> Good question.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.100
Do you think in-house testing,
meaning with your own team

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.964
or the client,
is better than no testing

00:39:47.965 --> 00:39:50.130
when you might not have access

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:54.100
to or the resources/budget
for outside testers?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.150
 <v Gaby> Definitely.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.910
I’ll say this.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.340
If you have a roommate,
if you live with your parent,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.520
if you have a neighbor,
even that is better than nothing.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.780
Within the organization?

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.780
Of course.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:17.030
The first thing that we actually
do in my team is to test inside,

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:20.660
because there are things
that are not usable,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:26.250
and they are these big issues
that you want to make sure

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.610
that you cover with friends.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:32.060
Let's say with friends and
family, meaning the organization,

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.010
your teammates, people in the
organization that is not involved

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.560
in that product or project.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.790
So definitely.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:45.460
And then with that, you will find
the biggest errors that you have.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.610
And when you have the time
and the budget, or you find

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:54.030
to make a connection or something,
you can test for accessibility

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:59.620
in depth or usability, but things
that you know that are not really bad

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.430
because you already tested.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.090
Always test.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.900
That's the summary.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.460
Always test.

00:41:11.194 --> 00:41:12.240
 <v Amanda> It's a great takeaway.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.710
Another question
from Ron: Do you try

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:21.740
to verify the voluntary product
accessibility template information

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.990
from vendors,
from usability testing perspective?

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.770
And if so, do you find that
VPATs are usually reliable?

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:35.420
 <v Gaby> In my experience,
VPATs are reliable.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:42.970
And this depends on the
organization that you hire

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.220
or you're working with to do so.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.750
I have worked with
organizations because, you know,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.940
it's a very good way
to have a third-party,

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.210
somebody that is not
involved, to do these reviews.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.010
When we compare this with
our own things, of course,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.140
we learn things from
other perspectives.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.250
Tests will always
give you learnings.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.300
But in my personal opinion,
these are very reliable.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.980
Of course, we do research
about who will do this, right?

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.390
So that's important.

00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.997
[crosstalk 00:42:26]

00:42:29.998 --> 00:42:33.320
 <v Amanda> Another question from
Ron: When doing usability testing,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.100
what's the smallest number of testers
you feel provides a good range

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.660
of feedback to catch the majority
of challenges on a website?

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.990
 <v Gaby> That is a great
question, and thank you.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:53.870
There is a theory that is
presented in a mathematical way.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.920
I am not an expert and that's
why I will not dive into that.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:04.870
This model I can share
in the chat later.

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:09.060
But if you test with five people,
you will find most of your problems.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:14.660
What happens if you test with
the first one, you find problems;

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.610
you test with the second
participant, you find those problems

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.610
and a little bit more.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.310
You try with the third one,
and you find what you already found.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.880
So by the number five,
you’ve pretty much found everything

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.550
on that iteration.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:33.980
If you're testing for performance,
for usability in a performance,

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.950
environment, or if you want to
make sure that you find trends

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:41.680
or stuff like that,
go with bigger amounts.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.710
But, because this is
meant to be a starter for you,

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.690
to inspire you, five people.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:52.790
But again,
one is more than zero; it's better.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.730
But five is the answer.

00:43:58.267 --> 00:43:59.430
 <v Amanda> That
sounds really doable.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.900
Another question is: How do you
make sure your test is flexible

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.860
for people of all abilities,
your questions, and the tasks;

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.590
including screen reader, tabbing
versus scrolling through the site?

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.890
 <v Gaby> You don't know if
your site is accessible, right?

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.010
So you want to find that out.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:28.060
If you follow the guidelines,
if you research about it,

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.170
you will know what not
to do from the start.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.327
But,
in order to make the questions

00:44:35.328 --> 00:44:37.150
and how to perform the test,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:42.140
my suggestion is to find somebody
from the community of accessibility,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.620
or a person with
disability and ask them.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.860
For me, I want to share
that sometimes I don’t know,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.030
and I still don't know how to say
certain things, how to express

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.200
in some environments.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.020
And I always ask because
it's the honest thing to do.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.290
I apologize,
I don't know I want to learn.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.660
Please help me. And I guarantee
somebody will support you.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.840
So if you go to the
community, again...

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.150
And this is why it's so important,
the inclusive collaboration.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.900
People will help you
and guide you with that.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:24.140
There are some websites that
have suggestions on what to do

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.350
and what to do.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:30.630
Perkins School For The Blind,
and Perkins Access, I can say

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.610
that they have a pretty
good set of guidelines on

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.750
how to do this type of exercises.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.350
So maybe you can
also check that out.

00:45:46.612 --> 00:45:47.760
 <v Amanda> Great resource.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.780
A question from
Christine [phonetic]:

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.150
Could you provide some examples
of where the WCAG falls short?

00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:03.910
 <v Gaby> In my experience,
there are some guidelines

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.700
that are complex for me.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:12.140
I don't know if it is my English,
but there are some guidelines that,

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.890
since I don't really understand,
I don't know how to apply.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.180
I don't know how to build it.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:23.340
So I maybe don't have, right now,
an example that comes to mind,

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.060
but for sure, what I have
experience is, I don't know

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.800
how that translates into something.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.250
So I either test to double
check and make sure,

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:38.830
or ask the community,
or my co-workers, or somebody that,

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:43.990
maybe, in a more technical way,
understands the guidelines.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.370
My biggest example is the real
life scenario that I presented,

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:54.100
where sometimes you follow
guidelines and they are great,

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.640
but they just don’t really apply
out there in the real world.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:05.010
But I find, as an example,
that's a good one for the future.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.540
 <v Amanda> Wonderful.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.670
We have two more questions
and then we'll wrap up.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:14.540
We have a question from John:
Don't you think having a better

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.550
and cleaner code from the foundation
of your project helps you build

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.570
a better and less receptible

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:25.180
to testing for better reliability?
 <v Gaby> One-hundred-percent.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:31.880
Building accessible sites,
when you follow the guidelines,

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.550
by default, immediately,
your code is 100%.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.923
So my suggestion to
developers all the time is,

00:47:45.924 --> 00:47:48.090
this is good for everyone.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.730
Accessibility is an umbrella
that covers everyone.

00:47:56.528 --> 00:47:57.420
 <v Amanda> Absolutely.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:03.320
One last question from Luna: Do
you have any additional resources

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.150
for introducing accessibility-testing
requirements to an organization?

00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:12.040
 <v Gaby> Of course.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.690
If you're on Slack,
or later in this chat, I can share.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:21.040
Again, Nielsen Norman
Group, they have, like,

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.160
a set of usability testing
101, why to do usability test,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:27.390
listing some facts.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.770
And regarding the process,
I think this is one of the things

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.990
where you make your own recipe.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.738
If you learn and find answers
and it's working for you,

00:48:40.739 --> 00:48:42.320
that is perfect.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.490
You don't have to follow any
other things that don't make sense

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.560
for your reality, right?

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:53.050
I find that when we have these
situations where we get too strict

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:57.410
with the steps and with the
requirements and with the things,

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.960
people lose interest, right?

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.390
Because it's too hard.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.320
I don't have this,
I don't have that.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.020
I cannot record, so I won't do it.
No, always do it.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.030
And you'll grow.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:12.110
And in this journey, you will find
things that work better for you.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.510
I would go to Nielsen Norman Group
for starters, and that would be good.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.880
They have good
information about it.
