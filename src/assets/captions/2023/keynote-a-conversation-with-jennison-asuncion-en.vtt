00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.340
Keynote: A conversation
with Jennison Asuncion.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.660
Speakers for this talk
include Jennison Asuncion,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.890
co-founder Global Accessibility
Awareness Day, GAAD,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.180
and the GAAD Foundation;
And Joe Dolson,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.540
WordPress Accessibility Day
lead organizer, and owner

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.160
of Accessible Web Design.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.960
This presentation was recorded
on September 27th, 2023.

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:32.280
 <v Joe Dolson> Welcome, everybody,
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.146
My name is Joe Dolson,
and I am one of the lead organizers

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:39.070
for this event.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.690
I am thrilled to be here
for my Keynote conversation

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.100
with Jennison Asuncion.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.950
Jennison founded Global
Accessibility Awareness Day in 2012,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.940
which is an event dedicated to
learning about digital access

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.780
and inclusion about
people with disabilities.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.400
And that event was
a key inspiration

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.290
for when we founded WordPress
Accessibility Day in 2020.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.000
It was an incredibly important
movement in the accessibility space

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.230
and still is.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.860
And Jennison has continued on

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.130
to found the Global Accessibility
Awareness Day Foundation,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.370
which has an even deeper
mission to promote accessibility

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.060
throughout the world.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.500
So I am thrilled to be here
with Jennison, and we're going

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.160
to have a whole conversation.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.490
I have a bunch of
questions for Jennison,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.950
but that doesn't mean we're not going
to also have public Q&A at the end.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.030
So feel free to add your
questions to the Q&A section

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.500
in the Zoom chat, and we will
answer those as best we can

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
at the end of the session.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.060
Jennison, welcome.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.160
So happy to have you here.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.460
 <v Jennison Asuncion> Hey, Joe,
it's a real privilege to be here.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.920
I didn't realize that
WordPress Accessibility Day,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.370
until you had told me, that it had
gotten its inspiration from GAAD.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.530
Just one quick shout
out to Joe Devon,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.230
who is the is the co-founding
partner of both The Foundation

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.110
and Global Accessibility
Awareness Day.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.620
This is certainly not a
journey I've done on my own.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.610
But I am so, so happy to be here with
you, and thanks for the invitation.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.390
 JOE: Thanks so much.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.760
It would be great to have
Joe and you both here,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.450
but I have personally been confused
for Joe Devon so many times

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.700
that I feel slightly uncomfortable
being in the same room.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.750
It might be a little awkward.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.900
But you're here,
we're here, let's chat.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.150
So of course, as I just said, Global
Accessibility Awareness Day was

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.750
a huge inspiration for
WordPress Accessibility Day,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.250
and that's been going
on for over 10 years.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.640
And these events are really
driven towards trying

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.910
to create a sea
change in technology.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.100
How have you felt that these events
have really impacted your experience

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.210
with accessibility on the web?

00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:57.267
 <v Jennison> Right.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.230
We'll start with the stark reality,
which is that at this point

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.020
in time, and it hasn't really
changed that much over the years,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.560
to be honest, we're looking
at 4% of websites out there

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.180
that are meeting the
minimum accessibility bar.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.470
Because if you look at the WebAIM
studies, looking at it the other way,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.400
97% of sites have at least
one accessibility issue.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.260
So that hasn't
unfortunately changed.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.440
And how that trickles
down to me as an end user,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.300
as someone who's blind,
who uses screen-reading software,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.970
I still encounter
the same frustrations

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.910
that everyone else has over the
years in terms of custom controls

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.940
that have not been properly coded.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.340
So I'm trying to find a
checkbox, and I can't check it

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.180
because it's not
keyboard-operable or navigable.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.580
Or I don't know that something is
actually supposed to be a checkbox.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.760
Dynamic content that isn't
being properly signaled to me.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.060
So that's that.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.990
On the flip side,
though, what I am seeing

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.890
in terms of change is
just the number of people

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.070
who are stepping in,
who are interested in accessibility,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.730
who are not necessarily working
in accessibility full time.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.240
There's room for everyone in
the accessibility conversation.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.880
You get people who are quietly
making changes within their company,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.060
where they don't necessarily
have an accessibility team.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.260
Or small teams that don't
have the same visibility

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.210
as some of the larger
companies doing their thing.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.020
So there's a lot of
movement happening.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.370
However, the reality is there's
so many pages being pumped out

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.650
onto the web at any given
moment in time, which is

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.100
why the numbers are still the
way they are, unfortunately,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.920
in terms of those pages and
sites that are accessible.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.510
 JOE: Yes.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.440
I think the volume of
content and websites

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.220
being created non-stop is definitely
one of those big challenge points.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.330
I just want to quickly call
out the WebAIM Million,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.950
which is the statistical data set
Jennison was referring to there,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.110
which is a great study that the
nonprofit organization WebAIM

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.980
does every year, looking at a
general survey of accessibility

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.820
among the top sites.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.920
And yes, those numbers are
just as bad as it sounds.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.280
It's really incredibly bad.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.840
 <v Jennison> And to paint a
bigger picture just for those

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.490
who may not know that, you know,
we talk about pages going out

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.140
all the time.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.380
That's literally
happening all the time.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.830
People are changing
pages day by day.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.280
Gone are the days where people
would wait and have releases,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.390
like,
once every four or five months.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.470
People are changing
things dynamically.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.602
Even for me, like,
I'll go to a website,

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:19.340
going about my day-to-day tasks,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.420
and suddenly I'll notice there's
been a change to something.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.400
And the way I compare to people
or talk to people about it is,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.880
as someone who is blind,
it's like me going into a room,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.950
expecting it to be
laid out a certain way.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.650
And then I walk in and someone's
moved the coffee table,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.300
or someone's moved the chair.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.590
And it just happens so
quickly and so dynamically.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.700
That I think is the biggest change
that I've seen in the last number

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.760
of years, which is how
quickly that's happening.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.420
 JOE: That is definitely true.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.290
And actually, I think this is
an excellent segue to WordPress.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.100
Because, of course, first of
all, in terms of volume,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.540
WordPress represents some-40%
of websites that exist.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.770
So huge, huge impact on the web.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.020
Secondly, WordPress is absolutely
one of those applications

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.670
that's been churning out change
at a higher and higher pace

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.510
in the last few years,
with the onset of the block editor,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.440
with the changes in Gutenberg,
and all of these rapid changes.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.980
Now, before this talk, I just
threw a ton of WordPress websites

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.750
at Jennison for him to look at,
crossing all sorts of different types

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.050
of websites: classic themes,
accessibility-ready themes,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.880
page builders, sites built
with the WordPress site editor.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.040
So after looking at all of that,
what's your general feeling about

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.900
how WordPress developers are
doing in paying attention

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.140
to accessibility in their work?

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.367
 <v Jennison> Yes.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:53.905
I would say that based on
the sites I've looked at,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.700
WordPress developers,
honestly speaking,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:08.133
are as good as any
other web developers

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:12.333
on other non-WordPress sites.

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:17.290
What I'm saying there is there's
going to be accessibility issues.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.340
There were some pages that
I looked at that had things.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.090
But for me as an end
user, keep in mind,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.610
I wouldn't necessarily know
WordPress from not, right?

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.250
If you're looking at me as an average
user, I'm just looking at the page

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.260
and the experience itself.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.960
Some pages I saw were just fine.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:45.180
There was one site in particular
that pointed out to me

00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:53.181
that it had won an award for, like,
the best-designed website in 2022.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:59.100
But from my look at it,
it was just a plain-text page.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.010
I am convinced that
there was more going on.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.610
Joe, this is the improver page.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.740
And I'm convinced there was more
happening on than page than I

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.220
as a screen-reader user would
have known, because I can't think

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.860
that a page that
strictly had text on it

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:25.590
in one form would have been
flagged as the most designed page.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.630
And I'm not being critical.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.140
I'm just saying, like, there's
something I was missing there.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.050
Because I looked at it and I went,
This is nice. It's all, like,

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:38.880
text and headings, but there has
to be something happening there

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.130
that has given it that
prestigious designation.

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:52.130
 JOE: So I'm going to tell you,
that website, it's got an awful lot

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.830
of animation on it.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.200
This is a good example of
how things get credited

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.250
with great design shops, and
that doesn't necessarily play out

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.710
for all audiences.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.240
Everything they did is essentially
absolutely meaningless to Jennison.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.020
Although, I will say that some
of them could cause problems

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.679
for people with
vestibular disabilities,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.130
or who have nausea triggered
from motion.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.860
These could be real problems,
but it was nothing for Jennison.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.990
There is no design there.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.050
If anybody wants to look at that
website, I will say, in my opinion,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.610
it's terrible.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.490
If you do suffer from nausea,
I do not recommend looking at it.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:50.433
The URL, however, is Impvr.com. I
found it to be a bit of a nightmare.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.450
 <v Jennison> Again, like you said,
it would have been lost on me.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.000
But to that point,
I think the one thing

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.690
that people should understand,
particularly for screen-reader users,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.160
but I would say for anyone
using assistive technology,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.290
is that the reality is, whatever
type of experience you are designing

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.410
for the everyday user, so someone
who doesn't have a disability

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.550
or impairment, the lens that I
as a screen-reader user is going

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.510
to look at that site is going
to be totally different.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.280
The experience is
going to be dictated

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:33.400
by the way the screen reader decides
it's going to voice the page to me,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.290
the way the screen reader and the
browser are going to play together.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.340
There is no concept
of left and right.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.980
I always hear about the left
rail and the right rail.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.130
To me, I'm listening to a
page starting at the very top,

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.780
going left to right, top to bottom.

00:11:50.781 --> 00:11:55.101
I think that it's not
necessarily talked about.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.800
When Joe sent me a bunch
of the different sites,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.742
he would give me some
great descriptions,

00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:03.990
and at least give me cues,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.560
like, This was built
using a page builder.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.360
This was built using a plugin.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.720
This was built using this or
that, or this was built using

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.900
a classic theme.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.820
At the end of the day,
a lot of that are visual cues

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.970
or visual styles, and things like
that, which, sadly, are lost on me

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.390
as a screen-reader user.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.000
Again, I only mentioned
that just because there

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.230
might be some people out there
who have heard of screen readers,

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.640
who kind of know what they
do and things like that,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.410
but they might not get the full
understanding, and the fact

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:42.080
that the screen is being presented to
me in a totally different linear way

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.030
than you as a seeing person
are looking at the screen.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.950
 JOE: I think that's an incredibly
important thing to recognize

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.620
about the whole design process.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.510
Recently at the WordPress
Community Summit in Washington, DC,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.850
I did participate in a
conversation that was

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.590
about embracing
accessibility-first design,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.734
which is essentially this concept

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:07.060
that the design
process should be based

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.430
on working out the sequence,
working out the control order,

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.380
working out how
things work in a code

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.220
and semantic manner before you
start layering on visual design.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.460
So that you've got this design that's
based on everybody's experience,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.500
because everybody's going to
have that as a common experience.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.360
Do you have any feelings about the
idea of accessibility-first design?

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:42.861
 <v Jennison> Well, this plays to
this whole idea of shift left,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.540
which, for those of us who
work in accessibility, is one

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.250
of the key mantras of
this last few years.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.420
This whole shift-left approach,
and thinking about accessibility

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.360
from the very, very start.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:03.740
And that also means including people
with disabilities as co-creators

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.470
of the designer.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.350
Or at a minimum, walking through
prototypes, getting feedback,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:14.190
all of that kind of stuff directly
from folks with disabilities.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:24.769
As much as designers and as
anyone can know the right things

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:30.890
to do, nothing will ever
replace actually speaking

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.090
to someone who lives that
experience every day,

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.170
who is actually using a
screen reader day and night,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.720
or using voice-recognition software
all the time, or enlarges the screen.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.590
It's a totally different thing.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:50.870
So having that feedback early
on in the process is so vital.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.640
Otherwise,
you end up in this situation

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.610
where all the best intentions
were done, and everything

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.070
that you talked about,
Joe, was thought about.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.360
Decisions have been made
because it was deemed to be, OK,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.100
well, this is what we
think is the right thing.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.380
And then you're so close to
launch, and now you have people

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.650
with disabilities try it out,
and you learn at that point

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.300
that things could have been
done in a more efficient way.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:27.120
Because there is this whole thing
of the difference between something

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.570
being accessible versus
something being usable.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.170
 JOE: Oh, 100%.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.920
And I would say that is the
thing that I have learned more

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.080
than anything else from
interacting directly with people

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080
with disabilities.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.800
I've been doing this
for a long time.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.580
I have a great sense of how
things are communicated,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.310
so I know what will
be communicated.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.660
But learning from people with
disabilities tells me so much

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.190
about the usability of how
that's all put together, where,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.020
why it makes a difference that
I put in a line break here,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.540
and I shouldn't have, because now
it's read as two separate statements

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.380
if you're reading through.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.640
You know, things like that I just
maybe wouldn't have thought of.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.170
So yes, for anybody at any
level, any degree of expertise,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.960
working directly with people
with disabilities is crucial

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.550
to really getting a good sense.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.870
Segueing from that, it seems
really natural to talk a little bit

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.070
about your goals in your
day job at LinkedIn.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.640
One of those goals is getting
more people with disabilities

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.700
into the workforce,
not just as accessibility testers

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.170
or as specialists, but people who
are performing day-to-day work

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.450
in all areas, people who are involved
in this creation of products,

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.780
but not specialized
in accessibility.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.560
In WordPress, one of our goals
in the accessibility team is

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.180
to build a platform that
supports people with disabilities

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.260
in creating and
editing web content.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.080
Now, I don't know how far WordPress
has really gotten to that.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.950
We've worked hard,
but there's so much to do,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.620
and it's always fighting
against designers.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.220
But two parts to this
question: How much

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.230
of an impact do you think we can
have if we really get a great,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.790
accessible back-end program
in WordPress at getting people

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.560
with disabilities
employed productively?

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.840
And then I did also ask you to
look at the WordPress Admin.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.810
Do you have any thoughts
about where we stand on that?

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.310
 <v Jennison> Sure.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.700
So let me take your first question.

00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:30.470
The impact is significant.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.550
If you are wanting to say, like,
Why should we be doing this?

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.860
Why should we be making
the WordPress back-end

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.870
in particular accessible?
Because people with disabilities,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.610
from an employment perspective,
why wouldn't they want

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.020
to be developers or
designers of WordPress sites?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.850
From a gainful employment,
you talked about 40%

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.900
of websites these days are
powered by WordPress, right?

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.410
Why wouldn't people with
disabilities want a cut of the action

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:11.020
to be productive people working
behind the scenes, building sites?

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.280
Now that's from that perspective,
so that's employment.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.150
Beyond that, what if someone
with a disability just wants

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.780
to get out there and be
known, whether it's they want

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.120
to start a business or they
just want to put out a blog

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.550
and get known out there.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.650
They want to be out there,
part of the conversation, or part

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.420
of the E-business or the
E-commerce realm, if you will?

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:40.190
 JOE: 100%, yes.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.340
 <v Jennison> I'm
blocking all of that.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.400
And the pieces to
creating WordPress,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.540
making that all accessible
opens that whole world up.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.400
Without it, we would be either
having to depend on other people

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.970
to design the sites for us,
and that takes away our independence.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.060
What if we decide at 02:00
in the morning, we come up

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.554
with this really
neat idea and thought

00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:13.510
we want to get that implemented?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:19.970
Well, I'd rather not have to
wait until daytime to ask someone

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.710
to give me a hand with it.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.790
I'd like to be able to
independently get in there

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:31.050
and make that change myself
as an end user, as an admin.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.500
So I think it is so crucial.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.100
Again, given the market share
that you folks have, people want

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.900
to use WordPress, and that
includes folks with disabilities

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.610
and impairments; and like I
said, in all different realms.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.570
 JOE: Yes, You really nailed one
of the places where accessibility

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.540
in WordPress really need
to be coming together

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.110
and should be coming together,
and that's that, you know,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:04.690
WordPress has this publishing policy
about democratizing publishing,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.460
and that's the whole
goal of WordPress.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.030
And that doesn't really mean
anything until we have a really,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.150
truly, fully accessible back-end.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.380
Because right now we're
democratizing really only for those

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.900
who have a specific
subset of capabilities.

00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:22.661
 <v Jennison> Right.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.790
Absolutely.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:31.000
And I just want to point out
that people with disabilities,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.600
we're not a monolith; we
all have different needs.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.580
And I'm probably preaching
to the choir here, but just

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:43.180
because something is accessible
to me, doesn't mean it's going

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.080
to be accessible and
usable to someone else

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.410
who might also be a
blind screen-reader user,

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.670
which also means that people
with another disability

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.790
might find the experience completely
accessible to them, right?

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:02.480
So just to make it clear that when
we were talking to your point,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.400
Joe, about democratizing, you need
to think about the full breadth

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.200
of disability and impairment.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.510
And it's not just about
screen-reader users.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.790
It includes the full range of
disability or impairment, which is

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.060
why it's so important to
include people with a variety

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.020
of disabilities or impairments
who are using a variety

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.010
of different assistive
technologies, or not.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.240
They might just be low vision
and able to use a mouse.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.780
So just getting a full range as
you're continuing to democratize.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.780
Now, to get to your other
question, you did give me access

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.980
to the admin experience
for your latest version.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.420
I didn't have a chance to
look at the classic version,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.150
just to be transparent on that.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.490
But there are two things
that I'll mention.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.910
First is styles.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.010
There's this ability
to change the styles.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.360
And I'm just looking
at my notes real quick.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.275
When I was looking at the
styles, it said, like,

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:28.260
Choose a different style
for the combinations.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.060
And it gave me a list
of the different styles.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.530
So for example, Aubergine,
Blackout, Canary, Electric.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.550
As I was going down that
list, I was, like,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.130
It would be really great to
actually get a description

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.790
of what those styles look like,
even if it's just telling me

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.960
what the fonts...
Like, what makes Electric Electric?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.440
As it stood, they were just
words to me with buttons.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:01.110
So even though I'm blind,
if I'm going to create a page,

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.570
I want it to look
visually appealing.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:09.010
So not knowing what Electric was
versus Canary, having some sort

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.900
of alternative text description
of what those styles were,

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.120
[crosstalk 00:23:15]

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.650
I wouldn’t know.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.650
 JOE: Yes.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.270
That’s a really good example of
those places where we just need

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.950
to do a better job at
providing a good description

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.760
of what something is
going to do visually.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.760
I will tell you, actually,
I'm aware of that issue.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.430
So just for context for the
people paying attention,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.960
what Jennison is talking about
there is the style selection

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.330
of alternate styles within
a theme in the site editor,

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.510
which is kind of a
powerful new option

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.550
just to have style variations
available for these themes.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.100
It's neat.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.230
But as he said,
when he's exploring them,

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.210
he just doesn't get
enough information to know

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.850
why he would pick
any particular style.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.700
It’s an error in judgment
to think that just

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.230
because somebody can't see the
styles, that they don't care

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.510
what they're choosing.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:14.030
And so providing those descriptions
is legitimately difficult.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.720
I mean, it's difficult to describe
exactly what has changed here

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.970
without having paragraph
after paragraph.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.800
But that's the point
of trying to come up

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.040
with a really well-thought-about
design variation,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.020
which is that it should be
expressible relatively easily.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.030
But that's an interesting example.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.360
 <v Jennison> And just on
the styles for a second,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.970
one other thing maybe
to look into is that,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:46.450
when I selected a style,
just choose any one of them,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.940
it would tell me that was
the current style selected.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.160
But then I tried to
select a different style,

00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:57.700
and I wasn't quite sure
if I had unselected one

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.560
and selected the other,
because any other style

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.340
that I selected,
it wouldn't say anything.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.300
So I'm not sure if that
was just a bug or whatnot,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.800
but I could only select
one style at a time.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.340
I couldn't switch between them.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.960
 JOE: That sounds like a bug.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.420
I'll look into that.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.880
 <v Jennison> And then there was just
one other example that I'll bring up.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.480
When you're at the place
where you're adding a page,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.930
you have three choices.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:35.040
You could go public, private,
or password-protected.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.730
Those were the three options,
and they were radio buttons.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.290
So as a keyboard-only screen-reader
user, my expectation is

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.700
that I would be able
to move using the up

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.370
and down arrow keys between
those three radio buttons

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.720
and choose one of those options.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.560
But what was happening is,
every time I choose one,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.540
a dialogue I had expected to be a
modal would pop up and say something.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.790
So essentially,
I would be trapped in that choice.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.550
 JOE: There is an open
issue for dealing with that.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.990
I can explain why that
happens at the moment.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:20.890
It’s because ages and ages ago when
WordPress was originally set up,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.360
password-protected is just
a variation unpublished.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.716
And so in order to choose
password-protected,

00:26:26.717 --> 00:26:28.150
it has to publish the post.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.980
So then it has to prompt you
to agree to publish the post.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.940
It’s messy, and there are some
fairly significant backwards

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.670
compatibility issues.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.660
However, the interface
could be much better.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.240
The interface shouldn't
raise that kind of confusion

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.890
just because there's a back-end
problem that doesn't allow people

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.170
to make the UI exactly
what they want it to be.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.690
And I think that's a
great example of something

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.320
that works really easily
and is very straightforward

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.530
for somebody who's sighted, using a
mouse, but is incredibly confusing

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.000
if you're not.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.620
 <v Jennison> Well,
I would expect that

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.190
even if you were just a
seeing keyboard-only user,

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.800
that you would also
encounter an issue.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.740
Because like I said,
at least from my experience,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.190
it was like you just couldn't arrow
up and down within the options

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.510
in the radio buttons.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.560
You were just stuck in the
one because the modal opened.

00:27:24.212 --> 00:27:25.332
 JOE: Indeed, yes.

00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:30.290
 <v Jennison> So anyway,
those are just two examples

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.167
of just interesting
things that I experienced

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:35.900
while looking at the admin.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:44.560
What’s great is you folks are
continually iterating on stuff,

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.890
so I think I'd be
happy to keep looking.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.520
And I think the more folks with
disabilities who get an opportunity

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.460
to take a look and try out the
admin panel, you'll get, I think,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.550
really great feedback.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.540
So I really encourage that.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.360
 JOE: Great.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.070
Yes, absolutely.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.220
We always want feedback.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:08.730
We are fortunate to have at least
one very heavy contributor programmer

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.010
who is blind and is working very
hard on making things better.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.400
He's also one of the
organizers for this conference.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.800
So that's been incredibly of
value, and thanks, Alex,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.480
for everything you've done.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.950
However, one person
working in their spare time

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.090
when they're not at their
full-time job is not enough

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.660
to really keep up and
make everything done,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.200
so we always want more.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.560
I think we should be talking
about this Global Accessibility

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.170
Awareness Day Foundation,
because that is an amazing project

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.030
of yours and Joe’s
that's coming up.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:45.280
So obviously, this is one of
the most recent changes in GAAD,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.100
which is the creation
of this foundation.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.960
It's got lots of
really great programs.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.640
What are you most excited about
right now to try and, like,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.370
move digital accessibility
forward with the foundation?

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.930
 <v Jennison> Sure.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.860
So two things.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.760
We started the foundation
because Joe and I,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.980
we were coming upon our 10th
anniversary and we were, like,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.690
We need to do something.
We wanted to do something.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.080
And because Joe and I
apparently aren't busy enough,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.450
we decided, Well,
why don't we start a foundation

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.280
where GAAD itself is part of it?
But part of what we're trying

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.800
to do and the mission is
really to disrupt the culture

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.010
of technology and digital
product development

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.320
so that accessibility
becomes a core requirement.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.640
What does that mean
really in practical terms?

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:41.640
So part of it is just; A,
increasing the conversation

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.300
that's happening between the
accessibility community, which,

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.510
arguably we,
because I'm part of the community,

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.900
can get into a bubble, right?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.900
And we can just talk amongst
ourselves and just get frustrated

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.280
and ring our hands,
and that just happens.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.350
But what really needs to happen
is we need to be reaching out.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.248
So what we've established
is something called

00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:08.050
the GAAD Speakers Fund,
which is one of the programs.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:14.490
And essentially, what that does
is it provides up to $3,000

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:21.140
in funding for either
one of three scenarios:

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.590
For an everyday technology
person, so that means someone

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:32.600
who doesn't work in accessibility,
but who has gotten a talk accepted

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.320
at an accessibility-focused event.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.810
For example, the CSUN Assistive
Technology Conference.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.920
Those conferences are not cheap.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.420
So we want to make it possible
if you get your talk accepted

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.230
to have cost [Inaudible 00:30:47],
whether it's for a hotel,

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:55.770
whether it's for childcare, or elder
care, at home, or whatever it is.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.970
So up to $3,000.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.530
So that's one scenario.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.460
Another scenario is an
accessibility person who works

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.530
in accessibility full time,
who gets an in-person talk accepted

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.490
at a non-accessibility event,
say, South by (Southwest),

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.580
or any number of events that
are happening all over the world

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.970
that have nothing to do
with accessibility per se,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.250
but they've gotten a talk accepted.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.100
There's still cost associated with
that; travel, all of that stuff.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.950
So that's another audience
for the GAAD Speakers Fund.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.260
The third audience are end users
with disabilities or impairments,

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.250
who have gotten something accepted.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.163
Because, again,
people with disabilities tend

00:31:41.164 --> 00:31:44.947
to not have the kind
of disposable income

00:31:44.948 --> 00:31:49.630
that would make it possible
to attend a conference.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:54.790
So we're trying to
open that opportunity,

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:59.830
and to broaden the conversations,
because we think that's a big thing

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.950
and an important thing that will
help with our ultimate mission.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.220
The other big thing
that's kind of exciting

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:12.220
that's coming up November 9th
is our first annual GATI Awards.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:20.880
And those are projects that are
basically living the mission

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.770
of the foundation, that are
putting accessibility first,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.651
that are involving
people with disabilities

00:32:27.652 --> 00:32:29.680
in the design and development.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.930
When we decided to do the
GATI Awards we were like, OK,

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:39.740
maybe we'll get one or two
submissions and we'll call it a day.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.890
But we were so gratified,
and also had a lot of work in having

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:51.140
to choose amongst 18
really great submissions.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.280
Of course, for this first one,
we had to make the difficult choice

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.130
to choose three, and we'll
be making that announcement

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.510
of who those three are next week.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.260
But save the date, November 9th.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.650
The celebration will
happen in San Francisco.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.960
It's a bit of a fundraiser
for the foundation.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.250
Not a huge monetary;
it’s $60 a ticket.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.730
But it will be in San Francisco on
November 9th, with details next week.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:25.190
To learn more about the foundation
and the other programs that we have,

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:31.480
you can go over to GAAD,
which is G-A-A-D dot foundation.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.640
There’s a sign up form there that
you can sign up to keep up to date

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.090
on things happening.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:43.200
Those two programs in particular,
Joe, are, we're just trying

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.440
to contribute to widen the
conversation with the speakers fund.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.200
But with the GATIs, the one thing
we don't do well, I don't think,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.760
in the accessibility industry,
is reward and recognition.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.730
People put sweat and tears,
like you folks putting together

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.070
this conference, this event,
and all the work you folks are doing

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.880
behind the scenes to make
WordPress accessible.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.660
I just sure hope that you folks
are celebrating internally.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.470
But externally,
we don't celebrate enough.

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:22.430
So we're hoping with the GATIs,
in addition to making it something

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:27.610
that people want to do in terms of
living the mission of the foundation,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.100
it's an opportunity to
celebrate, you know?

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.400
Nothings ever going to be perfect.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.830
We always talk about this.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.280
Accessibility is a journey.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.820
Merrill K. Evans talks about
progress over perfection.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.220
And those of us who've been
working in accessibility

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.180
for any length of time,
like I've been doing since 2006,

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.670
we’ve known this all along
that nothing is ever going

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.470
to be 100% accessible,
particularly these days,

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.060
with things changing all the time.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:05.460
But we keep moving and we
keep getting things better.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.740
I could talk forever about the
foundation, but we're just hoping

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.830
to do our part.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.480
We’ve had GAAD for the
last number of years,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.490
but with these other
programs, and more to come,

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:23.670
we're just hoping to just help out
as best we can to crack this thing

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.510
about increasing from
4% of accessible sites.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.450
We've got to do better than that.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.330
 JOE: We've got to
crack that 5% bar.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.970
 <v Jennison> We've got
to do better than that.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.170
 JOE: [laughs]

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.830
Yes, I think [crosstalk 00:35:34].

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:36.320
Yes.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.020
I mean,
having fun is such a big thing.

00:35:39.924 --> 00:35:43.167
Sometimes there can be a lot of
stress in doing accessibility.

00:35:45.413 --> 00:35:47.600
 <v Jennison> Burnout, its a thing.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.850
 JOE: And every time you
don't achieve your goal,

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:54.660
you feel like you've really let
somebody down, which is hard.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.780
And I think you're right.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.770
Celebrating that more is
something we should do.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.770
And we like to see this event as kind
of a celebration of accessibility.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.760
That’s part of the goal.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.490
But you're not wrong in observing
that there's a lot of work

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.830
in putting it on.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.830
That is very true.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.780
I love the fact that you're doing
this program to support speakers.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.930
For this event, one of the
main reasons we broke away

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.080
from the WordPress
community organization

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.300
and became an independent
organization was simply

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.980
because that would allow
us to pay speakers.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:35.420
The WordPress Community Organization
does not permit organizations

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:40.710
running under their auspices
to pay speakers, and for us,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.860
that's just really important.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.730
Because people with disabilities
are, in general,

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.870
an under-monetized group.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.560
They do not get paid well
enough, and are under-employed.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.310
We can't ask them to be
speaking at our event

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.930
without offering them some kind
of remuneration, and so I think

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.250
that's huge.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.790
 <v Jennison> Can I just
extend that a little bit, Joe,

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:05.480
and to also say that even in user
research studies, those of us

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.690
with disabilities are happy to
help, but our time is valuable too.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.470
And so, you know, here or there
doing a one-off is one thing,

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.910
but you got to pay people with
disabilities if they're going

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.790
to be involved in
user research studies.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:23.990
 JOE: There.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:28.380
This isn't somebody just
doing something they love.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.560
This is somebody going
in, and they're going

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.610
to possibly be incredibly frustrated
using your crappy product,

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.340
and they should get paid for
that, no matter what.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.330
I think that's just a general
principle of all employment.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.380
And it doesn't matter what service
you asking somebody to do for you,

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.100
you need to be paying that person.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.840
A group of people have
recently started a project

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.504
called The WordPress
Community Collective,

00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:59.300
which is looking for funding

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.780
to help support open-source,
specifically in WordPress.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.130
And one of their projects
is looking for funding

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.540
to help people contributing to
the accessibility of WordPress.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.150
So that's another way of
approaching this funding thing,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.130
which is trying to fund the people
who are doing day-to-day work

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.980
in trying to make
WordPress more accessible.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.730
Has the foundation given any
thought to other programs

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.490
that might fund developers
directly as opposed to speakers?

00:38:26.967 --> 00:38:30.070
 <v Jennison> So the short
answer is no, not yet.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.777
But that's just
because the foundation,

00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:35.010
we're still in our early stages.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.750
But that is a really
interesting thought and idea,

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:42.920
which I will take back
as yet another program.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.970
You're adding to our workload there,
Joe, but no, that's so important too.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.170
We’re not paying per se,
but we do have another program

00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:03.610
called the GAAD Pledge,
which invites open-source projects,

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:10.060
including WordPress, to potentially
spend a year taking the GAAD Pledge.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.640
And what that just means
is, you are committing

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.530
to spend that year, obviously,
making your framework,

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.890
your widgets, your libraries,
all that accessible;

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:27.100
but also creating documentation
on accessibility, all of that kind

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100
of stuff.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.730
We’ve had, for example,
React Native take the GAAD Pledge,

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:40.290
we've had Drupal take the
pledge, and Ember; and this year,

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:44.090
Intel is taking the pledge with
their open-source projects.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:50.650
So if WordPress might be interested
in taking the GAAD Pledge next year,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:56.370
or the year after that, whenever,
that is an option under the auspices

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.880
of a program within the foundation.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.720
Although, what you proposed,
Joe, is really interesting,

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.910
and something, as vice chair,
I will take back for us

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:13.080
to think about, to see how we
might be able to execute on that

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.070
in the coming years.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.890
 JOE: There are a lot of
projects that just, you know,

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.500
one of the things
they need is funding,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.250
and that is always a huge challenge
for everything everywhere.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.070
Accessibility is
always underfunded.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.390
We’re now at just 10 minutes
left until we have to stop.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.470
So I'm going to just go and
look and see what we've got

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.470
for some questions.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.920
So the first question is
actually extremely apropos

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.000
to what we've been just talking
about, and the question is:

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.610
Does anybody know of
any funding available

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.830
to help make their website
accessible? I guess that would be

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.500
in the form of grants.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.740
Do you know anything?

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.329
 <v Jennison> No.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.140
 JOE: It feels like
it's the sort of thing

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.240
that there absolutely should be
grant programs for, you know,

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.610
helping organizations with
the funding to hire people

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.740
to make their stuff
more accessible.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.040
But I have to admit, I don't,
offhand, know anything about that.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.660
I know lots of organizations
that do grants to build websites,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.123
but not necessarily
to fix the websites

00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:16.970
that have already been built.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.440
 <v Jennison> Now,
that's interesting, Joe,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.970
because you mentioned there
are grants that will help pay

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:26.820
to build a website, not knowing
about any of these programs.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.817
Wouldn’t it be awesome
if they committed

00:41:29.818 --> 00:41:32.230
to building accessible websites?

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.580
 JOE: Yes.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.130
Well, hypothetically,
if they were federal grants,

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.590
then they actually are
technically already obligated

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.950
to meet Section 508 because they
are paid for by the government.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.880
I know that there's always problems
with enforcement and follow up,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.150
and actually getting anybody
who can check on that

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.470
and make sure it's
actually happening.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.340
There's just not enough expertise
in the web development community

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.170
to reliably count on that.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.510
 <v Jennison> And if I could just
say, you know, real quick,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.770
around the WebAIM study
and the fact that about 97%

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.160
of websites have
accessibility issues.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:17.080
I'd say the balance of websites, just
in my experience are those websites

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.700
that are owned by small
to medium sized businesses

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.960
or just by everyday
folks out there.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.850
And what I need to keep
reminding some of my peers

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.970
in the accessibility space is
that for some of these folks

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:37.290
who have these websites, even though
they might be big and popular,

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.400
their IT budget or their
budget to develop the website

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.710
might be only a couple
of thousand dollars.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:48.110
When you look at how much it
costs to get a site audited

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:54.760
for accessibility and remediated,
those are real dollars.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.670
That's a separate conversation for
a different day, but something has

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.820
to happen to bring that cost down.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.773
So the average Joe
or Joanne who wants

00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:10.220
to make their website accessible,

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.450
they genuinely want to,
they just can't afford it.

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:15.320
 JOE: Yes, it's hard.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.160
I mean, there are challenges and
costs all the way down the line,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.230
from doing the testing to find
out what your problems are.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.630
And then if you're not an expert
in web development already,

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.540
then now you don't know
what to do about that.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.070
Great, you've got problems.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.510
Wonderful.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.181
 <v Jennison> Yes,
they're using plugins,

00:43:33.182 --> 00:43:35.200
or builders, things like that.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:35.700
It's hard.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.890
But I think that conversation
needs to happen in terms

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.190
of figuring out how we can,
you know... And everyone will say,

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.000
Well, if you include accessibility
from the beginning...

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.070
That’s fine for people
who are thinking about it.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.970
But for those people
who, for whatever reason,

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.700
haven't thought about it,
but then have seen the light,

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.550
if you will, and now want to
make their site accessible,

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.480
where do they start?

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.020
Well, they need to get an audit
or do something like that.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.171
How much does it cost?
$10,000. [laughter]

00:44:03.171 --> 00:44:04.660
 JOE: Absolutely.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.350
So this is actually
an excellent segue

00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:07.910
into another question we have here.

00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:16.724
The question is: What effective
change management strategies

00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:19.596
can we adopt as
designers and developers?

00:44:19.597 --> 00:44:26.929
This person,
Michael Nyogu [phonetic]

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:31.720
says he's a designer in a
humanitarian organization that tends

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.040
to accommodate accessibility
rather than including it

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.150
throughout the product life cycle.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.010
So I think he's looking about,
how can you change that?

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.760
How can you get good
strategies for that?

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.133
 <v Jennison> Yes.

00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:45.930
It’s the cultural change that has
to happen; and honestly, it starts

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:47.350
with building empathy.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:52.590
Your average designer or developer
has never interacted with someone

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.050
with a disability or
impairment, right?

00:44:55.050 --> 00:45:00.800
Let's just accept that as a truth
because we are the largest minority

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.180
but we're not everywhere.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.180
And so people aren't
thinking about people

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:09.990
who might be using an
alternative input device.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.870
They're not using a mouse,
or people who cannot see the screen.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.020
They're just not
thinking about that.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:19.040
So it starts with empathy,
bringing in actual end users

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.080
and actually watching them
try to use your website.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.150
That's one step.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.770
Then bringing in training.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:30.510
Actually doing training, and
making that available to engineers

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.630
and to designers.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:36.820
Learning how to annotate your
designs, all that good stuff.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.940
You also need to have a
support system in place.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.690
You need to have things like
office hours or a Slack channel

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.360
or some way for people to
get questions answered.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.090
You build those things in.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.910
Obviously, if you're talking about
it from a company perspective,

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.230
you need your leaders.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.170
A lot of what I've talked
about are grassroots things.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.960
But if your leaders at the top
of the house are not talking

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.060
about accessibility, unfortunately,
things aren't going to happen,

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.930
because priorities are
going to be priorities.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.260
If your leaders aren't talking
about accessibility, it's going

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.590
to be so easy for a manager to
say, Well,

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.300
don't worry about accessibility.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.750
It's not a priority right now.
But I tell you, if the executives

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:22.150
or if the owners of the company are
saying, This has to be accessible,

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.150
then that trickles down, and everyone
understands that they play a role.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.840
 JOE: Yes, that's 100% true.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.930
While the leadership may not be
directly doing the accessibility

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.980
or directly managing
the accessibility,

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.240
if they aren't actively supporting
it, it weakens accessibility

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.500
throughout whatever
project you're working on.

00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:49.950
 <v Jennison> And let's face it,
the leadership owns the purse, right?

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:50.430
 JOE: Right.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.520
Yes.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.910
 <v Jennison> So they do have a
direct... [crosstalk 00:46:52].

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.700
 JOE: Well, that can be a little
bit different in open source,

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.010
where the purses are somewhat
abstract in many respects.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.650
 <v Jennison> Fair enough.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.560
Yes.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.380
But yes, having the leaders talking
about it, and making it something

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.790
that everyone
understands their role.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:14.650
Because part of it is people don't
know what their role might be.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:18.330
And so defining that and saying
that, You own this part

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.150
of accessibility, and this is
what you're accountable for.

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:22.189
 JOE: Right.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.280
 <v Jennison> That applies.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.040
 JOE: Yes.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.180
And I think working out,
how do people interact

00:47:28.181 --> 00:47:30.250
across different areas?

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.270
You know, how do the designers
interact with the accessibility team?

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.350
How does the accessibility team
integrate with other processes?

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:44.110
What are the best stages for getting
that accessibility work done?

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.030
Because there's, like, a light
degree that's always possible

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.960
in design, but then there's more
that's possible in wireframing,

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.450
but it's not the right
time for screen readers.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.610
 <v Jennison> And every situation,
every open-source project

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:56.620
will be so different.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:01.630
So it's important just to just
sketch it out and then figure it out.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.340
Sometimes it's trial and
error, right?

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.910
This is part of the whole
journey piece, right?

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.500
No one way is going to be
the right way to do it.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.380
Every part is going to be different,
but you've got to at least start.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.720
You've got to start somewhere.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.650
You can't just use the excuse
of, Well, we don't know

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.390
where to go,
or We don't know how to start.

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:26.580
Just start somewhere, and then
make mistakes and learn from them.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.950
 JOE: Yes.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.640
That's what it comes down to.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.590
So it's just two minutes left.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.160
So I'm going to really quickly
answer a couple of questions here

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.630
that are very specific.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.830
Michael Posso [phonetic]

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:44.010
asked about the GAAD Pledge.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.960
So I'm just going to
provide that link.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.240
You can find that at
G-A-A-D dot foundation.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.750
And then it's under What we do.
GAAD pledge.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:56.440
And I'm going to put
that link in the chat.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.850
Another follow-up question
there was somebody would love

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.980
to share that 4% of all sites stat.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.200
And so that's from
the WebAIM Million,

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.790
and I will also share that link
in the chat.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:20.367
It can be found at
WebAIM.org/projects/million.

00:49:21.133 --> 00:49:24.510
Now I have to sign this out.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.080

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.270
This was so much fun.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.040
I loved having this
conversation with you.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.620
 <v Jennison> Yes,

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:36.100
And people can find me

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.490

But if you just search for me under
my name, I know it's a long one,

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.000
I'm happy to continue the
conversation with anyone here.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.650
