<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024,

00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:05.160
Accessibility Challenges

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.043
with Single-Page Applications,

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:10.740
with speaker Natalie MacLees,
co-founder of NSquared.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.443
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.619
<v Marina Weis-Haggerty> Welcome
back to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.270
Hello, if you're just joining us.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.448
My name is Marina,
and I'm a UX UI developer

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.788
for the software agency NuRelm.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.950
I'll be the emcee for this session.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.608
Thank you for joining us
for Accessibility Challenges

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.240
with Single-Page Applications,
with Natalie MacLees.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.421
Natalie is the COO

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
and co-founder of AAArdvark,
and that's with three A's.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.288
She is an experienced
web accessibility professional

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.728
with over 25 years of combined
front-end web development

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.289
and accessibility experience,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.530
including a senior UI developer
role at Sony.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
Natalie is a passionate advocate
for accessibility and has made it

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.570
her mission to train developers
and designers to incorporate

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.099
accessibility practices into their work,
building an internet that is accessible

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.100
to everyone.

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:11.958
Natalie loves talking
about web accessibility

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.899
and has been a featured speaker
at numerous web development conferences,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.949
web development and design meetups,
and WordPress-related podcasts.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.829
With her newly released
web accessibility tool,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.459
AAArdvark, Natalie is proud to offer
an innovative suite of tools

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.670
that makes reaching
WCAG compliance easier and faster

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.099
while maintaining
a high quality of work.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.374
I just want to tell everybody
to feel free to add your questions

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.438
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,
and we'll answer them

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.739
at the end of the session.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.399
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.469
That's enough housekeeping.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.850
Take it away, Natalie.

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:50.882
Natalie Maclees: Great.
Thank you so much

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:53.382
for that introduction,
and thank you for having me.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.508
I was actually
on the original organizing team

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.426
for this event the first time
that it happened in 2020,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.015
so it's really exciting
to be back as a speaker.

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:08.039
Let me just get my screen shared here.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.590
Okay.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.305
We are here to talk today
about single-page applications,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.479
so let's get all together
on the same page to get started.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.910
What is a SPA?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.349
We are very,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.029
unfortunately, not talking
about the wonderful place you go to to get

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.280
massages and sit in the sauna.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
We are,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.510
of course, talking
about single-page applications.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.539
I have on the screen the definition
from the MDN Web Docs,

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.369
but just to quickly summarize,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.909
a single-page application is one
in which we only load one HTML document

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.259
into the browser window,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.500
and any updates or changes that happen

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.849
after that point happen asynchronously
with JavaScript.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.823
They could happen
just on the browser side,

00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:07.859
or the browser might make some calls

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.919
to a server to get
some additional information to load up

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:11.979
and look at.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.039
There are three major
JavaScript frameworks

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.219
that get used for building
single-page applications.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.829
Those are React, Angular, and Vue.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.658
They are not the only ones.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.689
There are dozens
and maybe even hundreds of others

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.759
if you don't like those three,

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:34.410
but most of them,

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.500
I think, in 2024
are built with one of these three.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.670
Now, full disclosure,
I myself have never used Angular.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.756
I have just a handful of code
samples

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:50.648
throughout my presentation today.

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:52.245
None of them will be of Angular.

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:55.048
I don't have any familiarity with it.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.999
I have just a couple with React and Vue,
but the general concepts that I'm talking

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.679
about today apply no matter
which framework you happen to be using.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.529
Just from the title of my talk,
oops, sorry,

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.790
we can tell that there are
accessibility challenges with SPAs.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.289
Given that we know that,
why would we want to build one?

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.369
A SPA is a great solution if you need
to build a web application

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:27.808
that feels more like a native application,
whether that's a desktop

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.809
or laptop application or something
to run on a mobile device.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.100
If you want it to have
that very smooth, very fast performance

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.990
and feel like you're using a native app,
a SPA is a great solution for that.

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.149
In certain cases,

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.848
you can even take
advantage of local caching

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.850
or local storage to make
your app work offline.

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:51.389
You can build a big
library of reusable components

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.260
that makes it quick and easy to build
new views and pages and screens.

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:58.259
However, I would recommend
saving them just

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.579
for places where you have an application
and not for things like blogs

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.139
or informational websites.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.798
I have four main categories
of accessibility challenges

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:11.799
with SPAs.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.078
I will tell you from personal experience
that if you go into a community

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.380
with lots of accessibility professionals
and you mention a SPA,

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.030
you'll get a lot of groaning.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.030
[chuckles]

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.339
Accessibility professionals have
this immediate distrust when they hear

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.729
that something is a SPA,
and that's for a really good reason.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.358
They are one of the most reliable
sources of barriers

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.189
and accessibility issues on the web.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.079
I would like to point out
that that is not anything that's inherent

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.440
to JavaScript itself,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.909
and it's nothing to do
with any of the particular frameworks.

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.970
Accessibility is possible
with all of them.

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.539
The unfortunate thing
is that accessibility

00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:52.650
is just not the default

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.059
in any of the SPA frameworks
that I have personally seen.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.479
You do have to do
a little bit of extra work to make

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.480
those accessible.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.280
I'm going to run through

00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:07.238
just the four major categories
of accessibility challenges now,

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.499
and then we'll dig into each one
in a little bit more detail.

00:06:12.482 --> 00:06:15.299
First up, we have "page" changes.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.200
I have page in quotes
there because, of course,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.099
we're not ever actually doing
a page change in a single-page app.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:24.869
What I am referring to,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.195
though, is the equivalent
of that where a user clicks

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.500
a link and we load
a brand-new HTML document.

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.030
Now, the problems that we run into
with SPAs is focus management.

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.570
Where did focus end up
after that page change?

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.689
We might break our browser back
and forward buttons.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.580
They might not work as expected.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.750
Of course, the title element
that's in the head of the document

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.129
only loads up once.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:53.939
We'll dig a look into how to address
all of those issues later.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.760
The next big category is focus management.
Now,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.930
in a more traditional website or web app,
as long as you are thoughtful

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:06.839
about the order that you place
elements in your code,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.189
most of the time, focus management
pretty much takes care of itself.

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:13.800
There's just a few exceptions
where you have to put

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.350
a little extra thoughtfulness
into focus management.

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.900
In a SPA, on the other hand,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.869
you have to think
about focus management a lot.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.288
Your users
will really appreciate you putting

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:31.380
some extra thoughtfulness into where focus
is at any given time in the application.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.519
The third big challenge
is content changes.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.349
By this, I just mean those partial page
updates where a little bit of content

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.179
is loaded or changed on the page.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.899
In this case, we have
to figure out how do we let users

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.070
know that that's there?

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:49.770
When should we move focus
and when should we not?

00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:51.269
We'll talk about that.

00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:55.522
Then we have
the infamous SPA problem

00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:57.870
of lots of custom components.

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:03.539
I have a theory, like a two-part theory,
on why SPAs

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.399
have so many custom components.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.469
The first one is that all the tutorials
that I have seen that teach people

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.390
how to use things like React and Vue

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:15.569
use very bad practice code.

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.689
I think it gets learned right alongside
the framework that,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.140
"Sure, just add
a click handler onto this div.

00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:27.088
It doesn't matter," but,

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:28.650
of course, that can cause a problem.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.510
We'll talk about it a little bit later.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.179
The other part,
the other reason I think SPAs

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.590
have so many custom components in them
is that if a developer is going

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.340
out of their way to build a SPA,
they want it to feel unique.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.580
They don't want it
to feel like just any other website,

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:46.649
which is why they don't want to have

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.869
those browser default checkboxes
or radio buttons showing in the interface.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.459
We'll dig into some issues
with custom components and some ways

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.910
that you can make those work
better for everybody.

00:08:59.964 --> 00:09:02.604
All right.
Let's tackle that first challenge,

00:09:02.944 --> 00:09:05.009
which is managing page changes.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.380
Because we're not actually loading
a new HTML document

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.729
into the browser window,

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:16.409
we do have to implement
all the usual things that the browser

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.150
does ourselves.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.201
The browser can't do it for us
because we're not actually

00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:22.710
loading a new document.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.470
We'll go through what those things
are and how we can handle them.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.180
First up, we have to update
the history in the browser.

00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:33.960
We need to insert or replace
an entry in the browser history.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.019
You could, of course,
use vanilla JavaScript

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.412
and the history API to accomplish
that and implement

00:09:40.485 --> 00:09:42.089
some kind of routing yourself.

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.720
You could also use a package
that adds routing ability.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.180
If your app has more
than just a couple of pages,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.280
I highly recommend
that you would use that.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.960
All three of the frameworks
that are really popular right now

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.589
all have a router package that
you can install that works very nicely

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.649
with the base framework itself.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.669
I also have seen that there are
a handful of SPA frameworks

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.580
that have routing built right
into the core framework

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.809
and they don't require
a separate package to be installed.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.409
That's another option
that you have as well.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.898
I also want to address
up front that English is very fun

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.830
and there are two pronunciations
of the word "route" or "router"

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.079
or "route" or "router".

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.260
I will try to stick
to using route or router.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.038
I actually have learned that I use
those interchangeably for no good reason

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:38.685
whatsoever.
[chuckles]

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.189
They are the same word,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.800
just with two different pronunciations.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.448
All right.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:46.610
We've got the history API taken care of.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.628
The next thing that the browser
takes care of for us when we load

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:52.160
a new HTML document

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.620
is updating the document title.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:01.159
We can use a JavaScript document.title
to assign a new string

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.390
to the document title.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.830
This does have one small problem
in that it doesn't get announced,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.790
but we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.058
As I said earlier,

00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:13.819
I don't have direct experience
with Angular,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.198
but I do understand that there is
a built-in title service in Angular

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:21.830
for handling just this problem,
updating the document title

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.419
in the platform browser package,
which is part of the core framework.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.300
For Vue and React, you actually have
a couple of different options.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:36.619
One thing that you could do
is you could just update

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:40.699
document.title when your component
is mounted on the page.

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:44.899
You could just have a method
that runs on that mounted hook

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.140
that would update document.title
in your component.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.799
Unless you have
a very simple application, though,

00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:55.279
I actually wouldn't recommend doing
this, because you're going to end up

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.998
with the code that handles
your document title spread

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:01.789
across all of your components,
and it's going to quickly become

00:12:01.789 --> 00:12:03.530
a big nightmare for maintenance.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.260
What I would recommend doing instead is,
in React Router,

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:14.320
you can use the render property
of the route component.

00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:17.759
I have just a bit of sample code
on the screen showing

00:12:17.772 --> 00:12:20.209
that render property
of the route component.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:25.249
We're passing in a page component,
which has a "title" attribute to it.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.459
When that page component gets mounted,
that title will become the document title.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:36.740
In Vue, things get handled
a little bit differently.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:42.220
We have some sample code
here showing setting up a route in Vue,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.570
which is just a JavaScript object.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.770
It's very straightforward,
and there is an optional meta property,

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:50.529
and you can store
whatever you would like

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:51.609
in that meta property.

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.719
Here we are adding a title

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.649
to that meta

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.219
and assigning it about us.

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:00.890
How we use that property

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:03.590
is we can set up a method

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:10.490
that would run on beforeEach in the router
that would get that meta value,

00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:13.460
and assign it to the document title.

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.178
This makes it really easy.

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:19.182
You would just define
your page titles right

00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:23.480
as you define your routes in Vue,
and then they get updated automatically.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:27.019
You could also use afterEach,
and you could also use a watcher

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:28.050
on the router.

00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:30.269
They would all accomplish the same thing.

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:37.578
Now we've got our document title updated,
but it hasn't been announced to the user

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:42.469
the way that it is when we load
a new HTML document in the browser.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:47.390
We're going to take a look at some ways
that we can announce that to the user.

00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:52.579
If you are interested in digging
into this topic in great detail,

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.130
handling page changes
and single page apps,

00:13:55.459 --> 00:14:00.079
I highly recommend an article
by Marcy Sutton for GatsbyJS

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.120
where she evaluated,

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:03.739
with real users,

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:08.270
a dozen different approaches
to handling page changes

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.469
and single page apps

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.970
and published great details
on all of the results of the testing.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.630
I'm going to go over just
a few different approaches today,

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.920
but if you want to really dig in,
I highly recommend that article.

00:14:24.045 --> 00:14:29.448
All right. Our first option is to use
a fixed ARIA live region somewhere

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:31.610
on the page
where it's not getting replaced

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:32.990
when we load a new page.

00:14:33.979 --> 00:14:37.519
We would use this to just load
in our new page title

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.170
so that it would be announced
when we load a new page.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.809
This seems like a really great solution,
but in testing,

00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:47.059
this actually didn't work all that well.

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:51.230
It was kind of unreliable and it was
kind of confusing for the users.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.639
It was also a little bit confusing
if users stumbled across this content

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.280
later as they were navigating
through the DOM,

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.508
because we don't normally see
the document title just sitting as text

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:04.309
somewhere in the body of a document.

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:09.769
Then I saw a suggestion
to just reset that string to null

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.700
after a delay of 500 milliseconds
or 1,000 milliseconds,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.389
but, of course, now you're introducing
even more unreliability

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.337
into something that wasn't working
that well to begin with.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:23.329
I would not recommend trying
this approach,

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:26.659
even though at first glance,
it seems like it might be the ideal.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.270
The next approach would be
to focus the wrapper.

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:35.960
I have two examples
in my code example here.

00:15:35.989 --> 00:15:36.989
One would be to add

00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:41.568
tabindex of negative one to the body,
and the other one would be to add

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:46.369
that tabindex of negative one
to whatever the container of your app is.

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:51.290
When the page changes,
move focus to one of those elements.

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:56.328
This ends up being probably
the closest to what happens to focus

00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:59.959
when a new HTML document
is loaded in a browser by default,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.798
but this doesn't solve
the problem where that new title

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:04.999
isn't getting announced.

00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:07.219
Let's keep looking at solutions.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.950
The next one would be to just focus
the first focusable element

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.309
that's on the page
after we've loaded a new page.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.810
This could be your skip link that would be
at the top of the document,

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.219
but this doesn't announce
our page title either.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:32.990
It could be a little bit confusing, like,
"Why am I on this particular link

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.459
after I changed a page?"

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:35.989
It might be really unexpected.

00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:37.409
However,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.939
there is a case where this
is the ideal solution,

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.409
which is if you are walking the user
through filling out a multi-page form,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.270
they fill out page 1,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.939
they click the next button,
they go to page 2,

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.909
and if focus
is just on that first form element

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.910
on the next page,

00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:56.780
they can seamlessly continue filling
in the form.

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.570
It's really easy and nice experience.

00:17:01.029 --> 00:17:04.351
That brings us to our final one,
which is my favorite

00:17:04.352 --> 00:17:06.941
and the one that we have implemented
in our app,

00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:08.926
which is to focus the H1

00:17:09.116 --> 00:17:12.019
for the new document
that got loaded on the page.

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:17.112
here we would have to assign
a tab index of minus one to the H1,

00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:20.030
and then focus would move to that.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:23.873
Our new page title gets announced
because focus is on this H1.

00:17:24.763 --> 00:17:27.769
Focus is somewhere
near the beginning of the document,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.729
so it's a pretty reasonable experience
for where focus lands

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.729
and reasonably straightforward
to figure out why it's there

00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:37.269
and how to get
around the rest of the document.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.129
We were able to create just
a reusable component for this page header

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.868
and then write a directive in Vue
that just automatically moves focus

00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:52.638
to this every time the page changes,
so we have just super easy reusable code

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:53.990
in one place to maintain.

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.366
All right.

00:17:57.499 --> 00:17:58.638
Our second challenge,

00:17:58.639 --> 00:18:00.889
which we've already
started tackling a little bit

00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:03.740
because it bleeds
into those page changes,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.300
is focus management.

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:08.516
We've already talked about how to handle
focus management

00:18:08.516 --> 00:18:09.686
with page changes.

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.615
I wanted to just quickly review
some other places

00:18:12.616 --> 00:18:16.217
that I often see focus management
not handled correctly

00:18:16.247 --> 00:18:20.210
so that we're getting those implemented
correctly in our SPAs.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.020
The first one would be with modals

00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:26.129
and to make sure
that we're handling modals correctly.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.729
I'm going to click on a button
and I have a little cursor there to show

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.809
that I'm clicking on a button.

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:34.969
I know that's not
how everybody clicks on a button,

00:18:34.969 --> 00:18:36.169
but I needed a visual.

00:18:37.189 --> 00:18:38.929
It's going to open a modal.

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:44.090
The first thing I want to happen is I want
to move focus to the modal

00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:45.319
as soon as it's opened.

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:48.320
There's a few different ways
that we could do it.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.961
We could move focus
to the first focusable element

00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:53.051
inside the modal,

00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:56.171
which is probably going
to be the button to close it.

00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:00.170
We could also use
that tab index of minus one

00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:03.799
on the heading of the modal
and move focus to that heading,

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:08.539
or we could move focus
to the container of the modal.

00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:13.429
Any one of those will work
and you can try them out for yourself,

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.549
see which one you like best,
which one tests the best

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.060
with your particular user base
to decide on which one you want.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.939
Now we have focus in the modal.

00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:25.999
While the modal is opened,
we need to make sure

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.370
that focus stays trapped inside the modal.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.110
I shouldn't be able to tab
and get to links

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:33.860
that are behind that modal on the page.

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:37.130
If I get to the last item
in the modal and hit tab again,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.919
focus should go
back to the top of the modal.

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:43.029
We need to make sure focus stays
trapped in there.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.529
Another thing that people
frequently forget,

00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:49.429
hitting the escape key on your keyboard
should close the modal,

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.619
so make sure that that escape key works
and then also that you have one

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.260
or more buttons inside
the modal that will close it.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.660
I'm going to close the modal now.

00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:05.120
Now focus needs to return to the element
that opened the modal to begin with,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.109
so the user can just pick up right
where they left off and continue along.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.470
Next is form errors

00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:16.929
and handling those correctly.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.709
On my screen,
I have a very simple login form

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:23.092
with just an email address,

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:25.090
a password and a "Sign In," button.

00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:29.529
I have an error the user has forgotten
to fill in their email address.

00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:32.558
I have an error message
showing right under

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:35.422
that email address field that says,
"Your email address

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.000
is required to log in."

00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:41.119
In this case, the user
has clicked the "Sign In," button

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:44.786
and I have returned
focus to that email address field,

00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:46.898
returned focus to the first field

00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:47.919
that has an error.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:52.328
Make sure that your error message
has clear instructions on how to fix

00:20:52.329 --> 00:20:53.329
what's wrong.

00:20:53.949 --> 00:20:57.759
I'm currently having a nightmare
with a vendor that I'm trying to submit

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.570
a form to them,

00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:01.809
and every time I hit the submit button,
I just get a message that says,

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:02.959
"Something went wrong."

00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:06.790
It doesn't say which field
or what went wrong or what's happening.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.019
Don't do that to people.

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:10.419
It's terrible. It's a terrible experience.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.370
Tell people how to fix things.

00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:18.130
Next up, we want to make sure
that we correctly associate

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.810
that error message with the field
so that it will get read out to users

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.200
as expected.

00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:25.868
Here is my markup.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:26.869
I have a label,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.969
I have an input,

00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:31.060
and then I have a paragraph
with my error message in it.

00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:35.859
You can see that my paragraph
has an email error ID,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.328
and then in the input itself,
I have an ARIA described

00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:46.150
by attribute that references that ID,
which programmatically ties together

00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:55.059
my input and that error message
so that when that input receives focus,

00:21:57.558 --> 00:22:01.719
a screen reader would read out the label
and the error message,

00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:03.519
unless it's voiceover,

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.445
in which case it's going
to make you do something extra

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:08.495
to get the message,
but it will tell you the message is there.

00:22:11.879 --> 00:22:14.410
Third big challenge is content changes.

00:22:14.529 --> 00:22:16.240
this is where we're just updating

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.029
a part of the content on the page.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.440
How do we manage that?

00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:26.110
We need to find a way to notify users
that there is new content on the page.

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:31.719
How we go about doing that is going
to depend on the reason that we're placing

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:33.639
that new content on the page.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.771
First up, if we are confirming
an action the user took,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.960
so we're confirming that they moved
an item to a new place.

00:22:44.313 --> 00:22:47.140
We're confirming
that they deleted an item,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.520
or it's an e-commerce application
and we're confirming that they added

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.540
an item to the cart.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.679
We just want to provide them with some
kind of confirmation that that interaction

00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:57.679
was successful.

00:22:58.449 --> 00:23:01.718
In this case, most of the time
the best solution is to use

00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:06.038
an ARIA live region set to "assertive"
to make sure that that gets announced

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:08.499
and that they get
that confirmation message.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.179
We do not want to move focus in this case.

00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:15.950
We don't want to interrupt the user,
because you can imagine

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.024
if you were on a page

00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:19.138
with a bunch of products
and you wanted to put

00:23:19.138 --> 00:23:20.438
four of them in your cart,

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.509
and every time you added
something to your cart,

00:23:22.509 --> 00:23:23.679
focus moved to the cart,

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.049
that would get really
annoying really quickly.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.689
Don't move focus in this situation.

00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:36.069
The next one is an expected update,
which means that the user has requested

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.209
some new content.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:40.180
They got to the bottom
of a list of search results

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.300
and clicked a "Load More," button
to load in a few more search results,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.300
for example.

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:48.818
In this case, because the user
has expressed a desire to get

00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:50.219
that additional content,

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:53.710
we want to go ahead and just move
the focus to that updated content.

00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:57.158
If we load 10 new search results,
we'll just move focus

00:23:57.159 --> 00:23:59.259
to the first search result that was there.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.769
Again, this is, most of the time,
going to be the solution.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.319
You always, of course,
have to do testing to figure out

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:08.289
if that's actually
the exact right solution

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.759
for your particular case.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.539
Next step is if we're just sharing
some information with the user.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.279
If we have,

00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:19.729
A,

00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:23.948
some kind of process that's running
in the background and we want to let

00:24:23.949 --> 00:24:25.749
the user know that that's completed,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.039
if we have maybe
an interactive application

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.520
and we want to notify the user that
one of their coworkers has logged in,

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:34.652
something like that,

00:24:34.842 --> 00:24:36.578
we don't want to interrupt the user.

00:24:36.578 --> 00:24:38.829
We don't want to interrupt
what they're doing.

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:42.310
In this case, most of the time
the right solution is going to be

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.380
an ARIA live region set to "polite"

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.469
that would just announce
whatever has happened,

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.420
"Your report is ready to download.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.339
Cindy just logged in.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.569
She's here for the day."

00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:53.869
Whatever it is,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.950
we don't want to move focus
to anything new.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.560
We just want to make
that announcement for the user.

00:25:02.199 --> 00:25:05.980
Then the final situation,
which hopefully doesn't happen very often,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.518
is that we have
some unexpected and critical information

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:10.519
for the user.

00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:12.400
Something has gone wrong.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.509
There's an error.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.279
The user needs to take action.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.751
We need to we need them to take
care of something immediately

00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:21.129
if we want to interrupt them,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.860
because maybe
what they're in the middle of doing

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:25.089
isn't working.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.790
It's not going to say
they're going to lose their work.

00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:33.009
Something bad is going to happen
unless they get this new content.

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:37.869
In this case, we do want to go ahead
and set focus to that new content

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.110
and interrupt the user
because they absolutely need

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.790
to pay attention to this message.

00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:46.099
This should be pretty rare
that something like this happens,

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:50.349
that we have unexpected information
popping onto the screen that is critical

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.109
and requires immediate attention,
but, of course,

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:57.189
if that happens, we want to make sure
that users are able to be notified

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.440
that that content
has loaded up on the screen.

00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:07.630
All right. Our fourth big challenge
with SPAS is those custom components.

00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:10.239
If you, like me,

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.710
have been building websites
for a very long time

00:26:13.449 --> 00:26:17.168
and if you are finding yourself
uncomfortably close

00:26:17.169 --> 00:26:20.139
to the 30th anniversary
of the day you built

00:26:20.189 --> 00:26:21.250
your first website,

00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:25.509
then you will know, like I know,
that web dev trends come and go.

00:26:26.349 --> 00:26:27.475
Nothing is permanent.

00:26:27.512 --> 00:26:30.662
Everybody changes their mind
about everything from time to time.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.600
However,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.519
there was a trend in the early
to mid aughts that I think

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.689
it's time to revive.

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:39.969
That was called POSH.

00:26:40.696 --> 00:26:44.200
If you don't remember or weren't
around to know what that stood for,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:51.219
it just meant Plain Old Semantic HTML,
so as boring as it can get.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.409
However, it is really important
for building accessible SPAs.

00:26:57.339 --> 00:26:58.390
Just a reminder,

00:26:58.989 --> 00:27:00.909
HTML tags have meaning.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.960
An H1 tag doesn't just make
text large and bold.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.820
It actually means something.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.849
It actually means that that is
a level 1 heading.

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:17.559
I would ask that you please get to know
how to correctly use HTML elements

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.759
like lists,

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:20.620
which can be unordered lists,

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:22.779
ordered lists, or definition lists,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.819
buttons and links, and know when to use
a button and when to use a link.

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:33.279
Know how to properly set up a data table
so that the data can be accessed and read.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.140
Learn all about
all of the different input types

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.319
that you have available to you in a form.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.490
Learn how to use headings
and how they create sections of content

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:44.629
that are headed up by that heading.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.239
Learn how to use figure elements
and captions so that you can tie

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.910
a visible caption to an image.

00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:54.669
Learn how to properly set up navigation.

00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:57.879
Learn how to use ARIA landmarks correctly.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:03.939
Learn how to use fieldsets and legends
for collecting up groups of form fields,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.819
and then correctly knowing
how to use forms,

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.729
which includes labels,
form tags, radios, checkboxes,

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.840
and many other things.

00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:13.068
This is not a complete list

00:28:13.069 --> 00:28:15.308
of all of the HTML elements out there,

00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:17.531
and they are not
in any particular order.

00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:20.919
We are going to dig
into a few of these right now.

00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:26.049
All right.
First up is ARIA landmarks.

00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:31.600
Using these in your SPA makes identifying
sections of the app easier.

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:35.499
At a bare minimum,
you should probably be using

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:38.440
main, banner,
and content info in your SPA.

00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:42.010
If you have some
kind of navigation bar or menu,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.780
you should probably be using nav.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.190
We'll take a quick look
at what those look like.

00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:50.710
Here is the markup for a banner landmark.

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:54.129
We have a header element
with a role of banner.

00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:57.220
Yes, you only need one or the other.

00:28:57.429 --> 00:29:01.210
You could use just a header tag,
or you could use another type of element

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.410
with a role of banner,

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.768
but using them both
together doesn't hurt anything.

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:08.890
It's a little bit of redundancy,
and it ensures that if you have

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.550
a user on some older technology
that could only support one or the other,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.080
that it's still going to work.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.799
Next up is the main landmark,
which is very easy to remember

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.679
because the tag and the role
are the exact same.

00:29:24.249 --> 00:29:25.249
They're both main.

00:29:25.689 --> 00:29:27.909
This is how we do it.
Main, role equals main.

00:29:29.349 --> 00:29:31.239
A navigation landmark is similar.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.230
We have a nav HTML element
and a role of navigation.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.380
Usually that contains
an unordered list of our nav,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.509
and our content info landmark,
which is a footer.

00:29:43.738 --> 00:29:46.600
It's a footer tag
with a role of content info,

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:48.908
and that's usually
the repeatable information

00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:51.939
that's at the bottom of your page;
your copyright statement,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.278
your terms of service,
your accessibility statement

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:57.739
that you have for your SPA.
[chuckles]

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.759
Wrap your form elements in a form tag.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.239
Nothing stops you
from actually just plopping

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.229
an input element just directly
into an HTML page not wrapped

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.230
in a form tag,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.459
but you should actually always make sure
that if you are using a form element,

00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:21.829
that it is wrapped in a form tag.

00:30:22.459 --> 00:30:28.639
Here is an example of some Vue code
with the form element here wrapped

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.999
around our input and button.

00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:36.469
The form tag is important for two reasons.

00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:41.209
Number one, for screen reader users,
having that form tag there triggers

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.380
forms mode in the screen reader,
which makes it easier and faster

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.660
for screen reader users
to fill in your forms.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.490
Of course, you want your SPA
to be easy and fast to use.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.918
The other reason is that if you have
any fields that might be ideal

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:58.430
for that autocomplete that's built
into browsers where it could just fill

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:03.110
in like your name or email or phone number
automatically for you that only works

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.229
if the form elements
are nested inside of a form element.

00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:10.461
All right.

00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:12.081
Fieldsets and legends.

00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:14.299
Please use fieldsets and legends.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.260
I see people forget them all the time.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.350
Let's take a look at what happens
when we don't use them.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.009
Here I have some HTML code.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.049
I have a list of checkboxes.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.860
You just have to imagine
there's more than one there.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.900
Before then,

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.479
I have a paragraph tag,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.529
which gives me the instructions
for what this set of checkboxes is about,

00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:35.240
"Select your preferred hobbies."

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:38.059
Then I have a list of hobbies,
each with a checkbox.

00:31:38.989 --> 00:31:41.810
Visually on the page,
this might look okay,

00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:47.539
but there's no programmatic association
between the checkboxes and the legend

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:50.870
or that line of instruction.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.240
It won't get tied.

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:54.899
It won't get read in forms mode.

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:57.409
Here's what we should actually do instead.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.638
We should wrap
our entire set of checkboxes

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:04.189
in a fieldset tag.

00:32:04.939 --> 00:32:08.750
then inside that fieldset tag,
the very first element should be

00:32:08.779 --> 00:32:12.139
a legend element, which gives us
that line of instruction

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.270
for what that set of checkboxes is about.

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:17.660
Here I have a fieldset
with a legend inside,

00:32:17.912 --> 00:32:19.519
"Select your preferred hobbies."

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.650
Now that legend is programmatically tied
to that list of checkboxes.

00:32:25.129 --> 00:32:30.018
If one of those checkboxes gets focused,
a screen reader would read out the label

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:34.489
for that checkbox and also the legend
so that we know what we're answering.

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:36.680
What is reading an answer to?

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.610
It's one of our preferred hobbies.

00:32:41.539 --> 00:32:45.110
Next up, use a label
for all your form fields.

00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:48.799
Please, please use a label
for all of your form fields.

00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:51.440
Here's a bad example.

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.990
I have here a short form.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.729
I've got an input type text
with a placeholder and no label.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.490
Placeholders are not enough.

00:33:02.209 --> 00:33:05.450
They disappear as soon
as you start typing into a field

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:07.019
and they're gone.

00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:15.019
Also, for select, what you'll often see is
the first default option used as a label,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.718
which is, "Select your country,"
in this case,

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:20.720
filled in as the text inside that option,

00:33:21.979 --> 00:33:25.441
but when somebody makes a selection,
they can't tell what they selected.

00:33:25.441 --> 00:33:28.338
I actually had an experience
about a month ago.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:31.258
I was filling out a form
that had maybe 10 fields on it

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.779
that used only placeholders.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.699
I got most of the way through the form
when I got interrupted.

00:33:36.699 --> 00:33:39.229
I had to go answer my door,
and then I got distracted

00:33:39.229 --> 00:33:40.249
and did a few other things.

00:33:40.249 --> 00:33:43.010
I came back to finish
filling out this form,

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:47.330
and it was completely unreadable.

00:33:48.349 --> 00:33:50.540
What was I answering
when I filled in these answers?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.490
I had no idea. I actually had
to go back through the form,

00:33:53.762 --> 00:33:57.470
delete every one of my answers,
and then paste it back in again

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.850
to figure out if I had filled it
in correctly before I submitted it.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.019
Please just use a label element
and make sure that it is always visible.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.719
That looks like this.

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.630
We have an input type text with a label

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.119
before it

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.079
with the text inside that explains
what that input is for.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.128
We have a select element
also with the label before it

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:23.629
that explains what it is for.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.059
Our labels are programmatically tied
to our inputs or our select

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:33.349
with a "for" attribute on the label
that references the "ID" attribute

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.760
on the input,

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:37.459
so that those are programmatically
tied together,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.159
and we get a couple of benefits from that.

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:45.138
Of course, a screen reader
will read out the label when the input

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.550
or select receives focus.

00:34:47.154 --> 00:34:51.260
Then also clicking on the label
will activate the form element,

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:54.530
which gives us a much bigger area
for clicking things like checkboxes

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.469
and radio buttons and makes them
easier to use.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.439
Learn how to use buttons
and links correctly.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.720
Very quick summary.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.740
If I click on it and it takes me
somewhere new,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.190
a new page,

00:35:11.389 --> 00:35:15.170
a new view, a new screen,
or to a new place

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:18.050
on my current page, it should be a link.

00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:19.339
It should be an &lt;a&gt; tag.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.580
If I click on it
and it does anything else,

00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:23.829
it should be a button.

00:35:23.959 --> 00:35:25.279
If it opens a modal,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.389
closes a modal,

00:35:26.989 --> 00:35:28.039
opens an accordion,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.109
deletes an item, submits a form,

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:32.059
that should be a button.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.549
Update your current page.

00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:40.909
If you have navigation
on the screen in your SPA,

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.749
then you would want to use
the ARIA "current" attribute

00:35:45.499 --> 00:35:46.629
set to "page"

00:35:46.969 --> 00:35:49.579
on the page in the navigation
that represents

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.810
the current view.

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:56.358
You will have to use some JavaScript
to remove that attribute from the old page

00:35:56.359 --> 00:36:00.949
and put it on the new one when you have
that page change in your SPA.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.800
There are packages
that could help you manage that,

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.243
but you could also do it
in just vanilla JavaScript.

00:36:07.243 --> 00:36:12.439
Just this aria-current="page"
on the current item in your navigation.

00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:17.750
Please avoid interactive divs and spans.

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:23.178
The frameworks themselves
will not stop you from doing

00:36:23.179 --> 00:36:24.179
things like this.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.009
I have React code here
with a div with an on-click handler

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.959
that runs a method called "doThis".

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.660
I have view code with the same thing,

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.119
click handler that runs "doThis".

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:37.969
Here's why you shouldn't do this.

00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:41.929
Problems with interactivity on divs.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.199
First, it's not included
in the focus order.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:49.339
If I can't use a mouse
and I'm tab-tab-tabbing through your SPA,

00:36:49.789 --> 00:36:51.410
I can't even get to that div.

00:36:51.649 --> 00:36:53.179
It won't even receive focus.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.920
Second is that even if somehow I do manage
to get focus on there,

00:36:57.979 --> 00:37:01.760
it's not going to respond if I hit
the enter key or the space key

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:02.969
the way a button would.

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:08.269
Third, it's not going to announce
to a screen reader that it's a button.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.590
A screen reader user
can hear the text,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.539
but they don't know

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.290
that it's an interactive element
that they can press on.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.690
It's not supported in high contrast mode.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.770
Users who are flipping
their browser to high contrast mode,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.070
they don't get that support for it.

00:37:23.539 --> 00:37:24.890
Then if it's a link,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.069
it doesn't have
that nice right-click context menu

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:32.269
if I right-click on it to pick
from that list of options.

00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:33.999
You might be thinking,

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:36.419
"Well, sure, but can I just fix
those items?"

00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:38.099
Could.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.520
You could add a tab index of zero.

00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:45.080
You could add also
a key-up handler and check to see,

00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:47.639
is it the space bar
or the enter key being pressed?

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:51.790
If it is, go ahead and run the same method
that you attach to the on-click handler.

00:37:52.189 --> 00:37:54.920
You could add
an ARIA role of "button" to it

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.569
and on and on and on,

00:37:57.169 --> 00:38:00.080
or you could just use a button.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.809
You could just replace a button.

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:07.580
I have a button and an on-click handler
for "doThis" in React and also in Vue.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.330
Do this and you get
your accessibility for free.

00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:16.340
You don't have to do anything extra
to make that work for anybody.

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:21.950
To wrap up, a few last reminders.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.549
Before you commit that code,
before you merge that PR

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.550
into main,

00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:29.169
here's some things that you want
to make sure you do.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.700
Test everything without a mouse.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.799
That code you just wrote,

00:38:33.799 --> 00:38:35.949
put your mouse
on the other side of the room

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:37.699
and using your keyboard only,

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:38.850
try to use it.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.990
Can you?

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.800
If you can't, then you have some things
to fix before you merge that in.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.829
While you are doing that,

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.960
is focus visible?

00:38:48.319 --> 00:38:53.448
Can you tell what element has focus
at any given time as you are tabbing

00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:54.449
through the screen?

00:38:54.769 --> 00:38:57.379
Make sure that focus is always visible.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.360
Next,

00:39:00.949 --> 00:39:04.579
please be sure to include
alt text for any non-text content.

00:39:05.029 --> 00:39:08.660
As an example on this slide,
I have an icon-only button

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.790
with a completely ambiguous icon.

00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:13.159
Nobody knows what this button does.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.580
This would be a case
where you might even want to have

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.000
visible text on your button,
but at a bare minimum,

00:39:20.029 --> 00:39:23.628
please include alt text on that button
so that when people encounter it,

00:39:23.629 --> 00:39:25.129
they know what the button does.

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:26.510
They know what to expect.

00:39:29.419 --> 00:39:31.369
Next, use skip links.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.560
Make it easy to get around your SPA.

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:36.140
Make it easy to get
to the different sections of content.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.400
Include skip links.

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:41.359
Then finally, test, test,
and then test some more.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.789
Test not just yourself.

00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:45.648
Have other people test.

00:39:45.649 --> 00:39:47.210
Have real users test.

00:39:47.809 --> 00:39:52.040
You will learn so much more
about your SPA by watching users use it

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:55.370
than you will ever learn testing it
extensively yourself.

00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:57.958
When you think you're done testing,
you're not.

00:39:57.958 --> 00:39:59.078
Test it some more.

00:40:00.178 --> 00:40:02.150
That is everything I have for you today.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.750
Thank you so much for having me.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.380
I'm happy to take any questions
that you might have.

00:40:09.398 --> 00:40:10.398
<v Marina> Incredible.

00:40:10.399 --> 00:40:12.018
Thank you so much, Natalie.

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:13.820
That was really informative.

00:40:15.319 --> 00:40:19.010
We do have a bunch of questions
here in the Q&amp;A for you.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.069
First question,

00:40:25.478 --> 00:40:26.659
this is from anonymous.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.198
Email address field with error
should probably have

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:33.380
an icon besides red error text?

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.129
<v Natalie> Yes, that's true.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.160
Yes. My example wasn't
as good as it could have been.

00:40:40.299 --> 00:40:42.339
<v Marina> [laughs]

00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:44.849
All right.

00:40:44.949 --> 00:40:50.929
What about aria-errormessage
instead of aria-describedby?

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.690
<v Natalie> Oh, actually, I don't know
about aria-errormessage.

00:40:56.835 --> 00:40:59.035
That is a new one to me.
I will look into it.

00:41:01.566 --> 00:41:04.126
<v Marina> Helpful, these attendees.
<v Natalie> I know.

00:41:04.356 --> 00:41:05.983
[laughter]

00:41:06.416 --> 00:41:08.418
<v Natalie> This is what's great
about accessibility.

00:41:08.418 --> 00:41:10.219
We all get to learn from each other.

00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:11.749
<v Marina> Yes, absolutely.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.630
All right. I think
I understand this question.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.989
Could you please suggest

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.999
what title should be provided
for the application where a user can open

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.349
and add multiple pages
in the layout at the same time?

00:41:30.634 --> 00:41:33.043
Maybe they're talking
about aria-page-current?

00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:36.209
<v Natalie> Oh,

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:39.289
they could add multiple pages
at the same time,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.140
but they can only be
on one page at a time.

00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:45.109
Only one page could be loaded
in the browser at a time.

00:41:45.292 --> 00:41:48.408
That's what you would want
to specify as aria-current,

00:41:48.409 --> 00:41:50.270
unless I misunderstand the question.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.220
<v Marina> Okay.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.890
Let's move on.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.030
You mentioned

00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:04.399
an article at the beginning of your talk.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:13.710
We have a couple people
asking if you could share it,

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.929
the title again.

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:16.829
<v Natalie> Sure.

00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:18.501
I don't know the title offhand.

00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:22.969
It is by Marcy Sutton,
and it's on GatsbyJS,

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:26.298
and it has to do with page changes
in SPAs.

00:42:26.299 --> 00:42:28.399
Let me see
if I could find it very quickly.

00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:29.429
I can share the link

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:34.737
on social media or in the Slack chat
or whatever after my talk as well.

00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:37.166
<v Marina> Fantastic.
Thank you.

00:42:38.332 --> 00:42:39.332
All right.

00:42:41.948 --> 00:42:44.209
How do you announce toast messages?

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.539
I know they can be challenging
for some users as it may appear

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.263
in a corner of the screen.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Natalie> Toasts are
a real accessibility challenge

00:42:56.153 --> 00:43:00.005
because they disappear,
and maybe you didn't--

00:43:00.006 --> 00:43:01.986
It happens to me all the time,

00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:04.047
I'm like, "Wait, what did that say?

00:43:04.107 --> 00:43:05.197
[laughs]

00:43:05.422 --> 00:43:07.969
I didn't get my eyes over there in time."

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.139
They are a real challenge,
and I would be really careful

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.190
with using them

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.560
and be really thoughtful
about how you implement them.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.307
I think an ideal situation would be

00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:25.027
if they stuck around
until they were dismissed by the user,

00:43:25.027 --> 00:43:28.220
but I know sometimes
that means they're going to stack up

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.080
and it can get sticky.

00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:33.619
It is something that's going
to require lots of testing

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:35.479
with your particular users.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.668
I think sometimes what you're going
to find is that a toast just really isn't

00:43:40.669 --> 00:43:42.050
the right solution.

00:43:42.169 --> 00:43:44.689
It's just too challenging
to make that work.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:47.887
<v Marina> Interesting.

00:43:48.457 --> 00:43:50.389
All right.
Got a question from David.

00:43:50.702 --> 00:43:51.710
It's an upvote.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.929
Any suggestions for creating
accessible off-campus menus

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.219
or multilevel menus
like Apple's website's mobile menu?

00:44:03.001 --> 00:44:07.339
<v Natalie> I am not familiar
with Apple's mobile menu,

00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:12.650
but I do know how I have worked
with off-canvas menus.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.400
I think they're talking about,
where you have the hamburger menu,

00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:20.026
usually, the little three lines
and you click it

00:44:20.076 --> 00:44:21.739
and the menu slides into view.

00:44:22.999 --> 00:44:26.989
One thing that you would want to make sure
is if that menu isn't currently in view,

00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:28.940
that it can't receive focus.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.619
You shouldn't be able to tab
into that menu if it's not visible.

00:44:34.029 --> 00:44:36.379
That's one thing that you want
to be careful of.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.030
When those menus open,

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.650
sometimes they open
and they're just over on the side.

00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:45.679
Other times they open
and they completely take

00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:48.169
over the interface
and they're more like a modal.

00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:50.150
If they're more like a modal,

00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:53.554
then all the modal rules apply
where you want to make sure

00:44:53.634 --> 00:44:55.639
you move focus, trap focus in there.

00:44:56.449 --> 00:44:58.190
If it's not a modal,

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:03.195
then your button is probably
already inside the nav element,

00:45:03.196 --> 00:45:07.788
so you can just leave focus where it is
and make sure that once the menu is open,

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:09.110
you can tab through it,

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.640
but when it's closed again,
you can't get focus in there anymore.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.440
When it gets closed,
you want to return focus

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.850
to that hamburger menu

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.080
and make sure that they can't tab
into the rest of that menu.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.138
I see that done incorrectly a lot.

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.861
That they will allow you to tab into them
when they're not visible.

00:45:26.861 --> 00:45:29.111
[laughs] <v Marina> Okay. Yes.

00:45:32.513 --> 00:45:35.323
Now, here's a question.

00:45:35.354 --> 00:45:41.479
Would you recommend put
the footer navigation

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.646
in a nav role="navigation",

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:49.248
or would this be misleading
when also having the main nav

00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:50.600
at the top of the page?

00:45:51.788 --> 00:45:52.788
<v Natalie> Oh, yes.

00:45:52.789 --> 00:45:55.998
If you have two navigations on a page,
that's completely allowed.

00:45:55.999 --> 00:45:57.680
You could even have four or five.

00:45:57.709 --> 00:45:59.419
You could have as many as you like.

00:45:59.419 --> 00:46:02.930
What you want to do in that case
is give them accessible names

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.630
so that you can distinguish them
from one another.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:10.579
You would have one called a header menu
and one called a footer menu

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:16.549
so that when you're accessing those,
you can tell which one you're on.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.370
<v Marina> Rosita asks,

00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:29.389
how can you make sure
that focus stays in the modal?

00:46:31.369 --> 00:46:33.949
<v Natalie> That is probably
the trickiest part of modals.

00:46:33.949 --> 00:46:35.959
[laughs]

00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:43.130
I'll just talk
about some really broad approaches,

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:46.998
and then you can do some research
online to figure out

00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:48.899
what one you think might work for you.

00:46:49.519 --> 00:46:54.319
One approach that I have seen is actually
to take the entire rest of the document

00:46:54.470 --> 00:47:01.579
and remove tabindex from it so it cannot
receive focus so that just you have

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.429
nothing else on your page
that can receive focus now,

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:09.470
and you're just guaranteed by default
then that focus will stay in your modal.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:15.739
The other thing that you can do is handle
that in modal code yourself

00:47:16.009 --> 00:47:19.069
so that you detect if focus
is on the first element,

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.629
and somebody hits shift+tab,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.729
you're going to capture
that and move focus

00:47:22.729 --> 00:47:25.461
to the bottom of the modal and vice versa.

00:47:25.462 --> 00:47:28.309
If focus is on the last item
and somebody hits tab,

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.932
you're going to capture
that and move focus back to the beginning

00:47:30.932 --> 00:47:33.832
so that you don't let
that focus ever get out of the modal.

00:47:34.249 --> 00:47:37.758
Those two different approaches
I've seen implemented successfully,

00:47:37.759 --> 00:47:40.939
and I'm sure that there are others
that I don't even know about.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320
<v Marina> Great.

00:47:43.711 --> 00:47:45.811
All right, we have about two minutes left,

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:46.919
so maybe we can get

00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:49.280
one more in,

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.230
potentially two.

00:47:52.009 --> 00:47:56.573
Any tips for SPAs that are wrapped
in native mobile apps?

00:47:58.821 --> 00:48:00.949
<v Natalie> All of the same rules apply.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.590
I haven't personally myself built
a native app,

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:10.999
but I think probably you might get
some little extra accessibility boost,

00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:14.883
especially Apple tends
to be very accessible

00:48:14.903 --> 00:48:18.619
and Android doesn't do too terribly
on a lot of things either.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.440
You might get a little extra boost
from that accessibility,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.240
but of course you would need to test

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.660
your app.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.950
If it's available without that wrapper,
you need to test it that way,

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.319
and you would need to do
accessibility testing on it

00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:31.728
as a native app as well,

00:48:31.729 --> 00:48:33.920
just to make sure
that there weren't any differences

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.920
between the two.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.490
<v Marina> Okay, great.

00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:43.580
Is it best practice that if you have
something like a hamburger menu

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.830
with a lot of links that when you reach
the last item in the link,

00:48:46.999 --> 00:48:49.249
next focus should go
back to the close button,

00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:52.821
even if the menu can be closed
with the escape key?

00:48:54.404 --> 00:48:57.469
<v Natalie> If it is a case
where it's a modal menu,

00:48:57.469 --> 00:48:59.919
I would say yes,
that's what you would want to do.

00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:03.589
If it's taken over the whole screen,

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.050
you would definitely want,

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.810
like I said, to have focus trapped
in that modal.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.309
If it's not,

00:49:10.999 --> 00:49:15.169
you don't want to trap focus in it,
because if a mouse user can access

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.480
other stuff on the page while
that menu is open,

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.580
a keyboard user should be able to as well.

00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:23.080
<v Marina> All right, fantastic.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:28.150
Well, thank you, Natalie,
and thanks everybody

00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:30.333
for attending the session.

00:49:31.039 --> 00:49:32.039
You did a great job.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:37.579

in chat or on social media using

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.589
the hashtag #WPA11YDay,
and you can also use

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.268
the hashtag #WPAD2024.

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:53.049
We also appreciate if you go
