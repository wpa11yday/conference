00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.759
<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.319
CSS Tiny Tips: Collection of CSS tips

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.559
for making websites easier to read,
with Gen Herres,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.519
developer at Easy Accessibility Guide.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.240
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.579
<v Simon Miner> Where she helps with agencies

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.799
to tackle the challenging problem

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.120
of making sure web accessibility
is front and center in their builds.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
She has helped plug-ins, themes,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.640
and web agencies define
their accessibility processes

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.999
and websites to make sure
that real people can use them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.400
She also organizes
the Baltimore WordPress Meetup Group.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.379
Slides and links to this presentation
are available online

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.220
at easya11yguide.com/learn.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.414
I will post that in the chat right now.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530
If you want to follow along there.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.239
We invite you to please feel free to add

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.199
your questions to the Zoom Q&amp;A section.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.119
We will answer them
at the end of the presentation.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.719
Also use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.973
With that, I want to turn it over to Gen.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.759
Gen Herres: Thank you so much, Simon.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.679
We will be doing CSS tiny tips.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.498
Let me grab my slides.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.120
Gen: All right.

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.999
During this presentation,
there is a bit of text to read.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.479
So I will do my best to make sure
to read the relevant text on the slides.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.839
If you are like Simon and
don't have the best vision

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.359
or aren't able to see your computer

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.519
well, then don't worry
because you can get the slides later,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.852
and you can follow
along just by listening.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.599
In this presentation,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.439
we will cover
a bunch of different tiny tips for CSS.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.699
We'll include information about CSS basics

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.440
and not so basics, CSS overrides.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.999
We'll talk about WordPress
and browser defaults,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.439
making text easier to read,
making links easier to see,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.423
and some helper classes.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.480
Slides and links are available,
as already posted in the chat.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.160
First up is CSS basics and overrides.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.759
You'll need to know CSS
basics for this presentation.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.159
If you don't already
have a good foundation for CSS,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.879
please take a look
at the W3Schools CSS course.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.319
It is a great starter course
for getting going with CSS,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.639
and has a wonderful amount of reference

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.720
documentation that I still use
on a regular basis.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.959
During this presentation,
I will be reading a bit of CSS out.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.799
I won't read code literally.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.920
I will read code loosely.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.479
For example, I've got this sample
text here, which I will read as class,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.240
screen reader text,
focus state, position relative.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.322
Starting off, CSS belongs
in your style sheet, not inline.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.639
Here's an example of inline CSS
and what we want to avoid doing.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.799
We have an HTML span
with a style attribute,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.960
color blue, and then it says blue text.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.599
An example of how we should do it,
what we do want to see,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.199
would be span class equals blue text,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.759
and then the text we want to be blue.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.839
The reason is clients change
their minds all the time.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.679
Sometimes they're small changes.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.239
Sometimes they're big changes.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.719
I had a company change
their primary color from green to red,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.759
and the option was you could either
update a small amount

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.779
of text because you'd already
tagged it well,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.302
or you could be doing
a huge amount of search and replace.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.479
When you name these classes, you want
to name it based on your audience.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.319
If you have clients actually
in there and editing their content,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.679
you'll want to use blue text, even though
in the future it might be green.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.919
At least clients can remember it.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.799
If you're using developers, you might want
to use the class primary color

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.894
because that's more developer language.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.839
When you copy and paste,
you want to leave junk HTML behind.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.919
Junk HTML is what comes
when you copy from somewhere

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.360
like a Word doc or another website
and paste into your website.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.759
To avoid this, you want to use

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.859
Command-Shift-V for paste on the Mac,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.720
and Control-Shift-V for paste on a PC.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.079
It's frequently called
paste and match style

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.968
if you click on the Edit menu
of your application.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.759
CSS variables are absolutely your friends.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.879
You can save so much
time and energy and hunting

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.320
through CSS files by using variables.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.359
You can reference
variables in one CSS file

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.799
that were declared in another CSS file,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.894
so they're really handy to have around.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.719
Variables allow you to update
something in one location

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.119
instead of having
all of that search and replace.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.359
To define your variable,
you will just use root.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.310
Typically, CSS variables are defined
with two dashes in front of their name.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.799
Then when you go to reference them later,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.259
you'll say class, blue text, color, var,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.839
that's V-A-R, Victor Alpha Romeo,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.919
the NATO alphabet,
folks, open parentheses,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.400
and then you'll have the variable name
that you chose.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.920
CSS color spaces are one of my favorite
ways to handle colors.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.219
We have the common hex values,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.260
such as 0000FF for blue.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.300
We can also list this as RGB,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.860
which would be 0, 0, 255,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.779
the same blue, or we can represent this

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.039
in the hue saturation lightness spectrum,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.180
which is 240, 100% 50%.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.239
I always try to avoid including
the alpha or opacity values in these.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.479
There is RGBA, HSLA,
but I try to avoid those as alphas

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.495
can get into a lot of contrast issues.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.920
Why do I like this HSL
color space so much?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.919
Mostly because I can start using
relative values with the HSL color space,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.119
and this allows me
to pick out coordinating

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.199
colors really quickly and easily.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.539
Here's an example with the color blue

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.679
that we've been talking about.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.120
We can say HSL from that blue hex code.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.019
Then if we just say H space S space L,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.959
that will give us
the exact same blue color,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.960
but we can also use this HSL
color space to do a hue shift.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.019
That takes the hue
and it just shifts it a little bit

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.759
to the left or to the right,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.079
depending on whether we
do a plus or a minus.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.999
Here I've got HSL from blue color in hex,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.700
calc, H plus 30,

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.520
close the calc, S space L.

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:16.919
This gives us a nice purple color.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.279
A little variation
from the blue, still fun,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.679
still aligned
with our existing color palette.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.219
I really enjoy using the hue shift
because that allows me

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.479
to keep my saturation
and my lightness where they are,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.812
but gets me some nice coordinating values.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.599
CSS nesting is another
one that I really like.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.079
Nesting allows us to save code
and make code more readable,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.760
which is win-win.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.134
It's done by using the ampersand symbol.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.679
Here I've got an example,
class, parent rule,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.159
and then I would list out
my parent rule properties.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.600
Then I'll put an ampersand, colon, hover,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.719
and I'll list out
some child rule properties.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.519
This is really popular
for things like anchors.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.994
You can list out the anchor code
and then include what to do on hover.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.799
How this CSS nesting
actually looks to the browser.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.759
The browser interprets
that to be parent rule.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.639
Then all of the properties
of the parent rule,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.839
and then in a separate CSS statement,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.039
how it's interpreted
by the browser is the parent rule

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.721
with the hover state
and then all the child rule properties.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.080
The next topic is CSS:has.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.439
This is particularly handy
for a lot of different uses.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.799
It allows you to say,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.700
if an HTML parent element

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.959
has a child of this specific type,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.559
then I want to execute my CSS,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.359
which allows me to apply
the CSS to the parent, not just the child.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.039
This is really handy.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.239
I've got an example here.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.220
HTML has body class,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.679
text size large,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.409
and then I have my font
size increasing to 125%.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.559
An example is in the Kaya theme changer.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.159
I have an accessibility preferences panel

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.651
and I'm now showing
the Kaya theme demo site.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.120
Here in my text size, I can mark it small.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.253
That's all handled by just applying

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.480
a class to the body of the site using
a JavaScript.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.359
This changer controls JavaScript,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.644
which just adds or removes
a CSS class to the body tag.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:56.399
Then because the body does or does
not have a particular element to it,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.812
it modifies the HTML font
size from 100% to,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.520
in the case of small, smaller.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.440
We can go large, extra large, huge.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.999
All of these different things
all accomplished just with CSS,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.879
and putting something into the body tag.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.999
I've got a number
of other different options here,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.679
including switching
the font for the whole site, again,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.360
just by putting
in a different class on the body tag.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.815
This can be really handy and powerful.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.320
Next up are CSS overrides.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.919
We like to add CSS
overrides commonly by using

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.680
body or HTML prepended
the existing CSS code.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.839
For example, we might have CSS
code in a theme that says,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.759
body class WP block button link,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.280
and then some appropriate
color added to it.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.539
In my child theme,
I could prepend that by saying,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.780
HTML body class WP block button link,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.720
and the color blue.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.400
Another way to do CSS
overrides is by repeating the class.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
If I had the CSS class
WP block button link,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.439
and the color white,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.920
I can override that in another way
by repeating that class name.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.040
I have class WP block button link,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.640
class WP block button link,
and the color blue.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.839
It's a nice and easy way
to override styles,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.879
especially from parent
themes into child themes,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.768
or from various plugins
into your own child theme.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.809
CSS!important.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.559
This is the override of last resort.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.199
We tried everything else,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.484
and we have no other choice
but to implement!important.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.980
Try to avoid using it,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.079
but it is a tool that
you probably will need

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.120
to use at some point or another.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.499
If you find the use of!important in places

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.239
like WordPress core, themes, or plugins,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.279
you should complain
to the developers who are using this code,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.399
unless you see some actual comments

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.279
in the code explaining
why they added!important,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.919
not just because they were lazy.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.813
Yes, I have seen!important in core.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.199
One of the times that you need

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.240
to use the CSS!important
override is for inline styles.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.679
As we said before,
we like to avoid using inline styles,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.719
but sometimes we receive
websites that already have them,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.759
and in order to fix a lot of the issues,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:09.720
we may need to override
all of those inline CSS issues.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.519
Here's an example of how to use
the star selector

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.599
with CSS and catch all of these strings

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.160
that have paragraph style color purple.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.640
We have the CSS for paragraph,
open bracket,

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.959
style star equals purple, close bracket.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.856
This will catch
all of the CSS with a purple substring,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.079
which means if someone used
color purple or background purple,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.759
it would catch that.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.279
You do have to be a little
careful if you're using

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.090
the star to catch your substrings.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.639
In this case, I've used color,
I use a variable, my purple,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.459
and I do have to put
!important because the only way

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.960
to override inline
styles is with!important.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.219
In the event you come across a situation

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.719
where the person has written

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.759
something like p style
equals color purple!important,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.806
so they put the important right
into the inline CSS,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.679
your only resort is to get
in there with some JavaScript

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.400
to override and clean that out.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.455
Or if you have access to the database,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.639
to get in there and clean that out
if it was in a page or a post.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.320
Unfortunately, I have actually
seen plugins out there do this.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.399
Always complain to the plugin developer,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.795
but you may have to add JavaScript
to correct it in your child theme.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.439
Targeting classes and IDs.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.899
Whenever possible with your CSS,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.541
try to target your class or your ID.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.239
Try to avoid targeting HTML tags.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.840
The reason is many plugins
are developed by developers

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.999
who didn't necessarily think about

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.159
accessibility when
they started creating it.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.119
Frequently, they were informed
about accessibility later.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.999
Then they realize they need
to do something like correct

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.599
the nesting of a button and a heading,
because certain things are allowed

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.479
in semantic HTML
and certain things aren't,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.416
so they may need to correct ordering.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.039
In order to do that,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.799
they can usually keep
their classes in the same order,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.000
but they have to change the HTML tags
around to make semantic HTML.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.840
If you're targeting the tags--

00:16:50.847 --> 00:16:55.679
sorry, if you're targeting
the class or the ID instead of the tag,

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.159
then typically
the developer will try to keep

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.919
the classes and IDs in the same order,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.125
even though they're changing
around the HTML elements.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.520
Semantic HTML
is a whole lot less work in CSS.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.119
Whenever possible, make sure
that before you even get there for CSS,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.279
you've made sure
that there is semantic HTML in place.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.800
For example, divs are not buttons.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.279
If you already have
an HTML button element,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.559
then it's very easy to style with CSS.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.160
The browser takes care
of a whole bunch of stuff for you.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.360
If someone has coded
that button just using divs,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.439
now you have to add a bunch more CSS and,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.167
of course, a bunch of JavaScript.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.719
On the topic of divs are not buttons,
divs are not field sets either.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.239
Those can cause some more problems
with the semantic HTML.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.839
Always remember,
div is your most generic HTML element.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.799
It's definitely very useful,
but make sure there isn't something

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.700
more appropriate that you could use.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.200
Some WordPress-specific
things and browser defaults.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.839
We always want to make sure
that our CSS includes resets.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.359
There are differences between browsers,

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.679
there are differences
between operating systems,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.919
and using the CSS reset gives you a nice,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.279
clean slate so that you know
exactly what the state of everything is.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.279
If you just rely
on the browser for everything,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.594
it can be a bit hit or miss.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.160
Most themes will include
a reset set of styles.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.599
If they don't, there are a bunch of reset
styles available.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.679
You can take a look at the underscores
theme, which is available for free.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.479
You just type in whatever theme
name you want to give it and download,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.160
and it includes some reset styles for you.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.560
Make sure that you're always including
body and form styles.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.840
A lot of times, form elements
like inputs won't necessarily inherit

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.280
their font properties
from the body element.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.279
You do need to make sure
that you're targeting inputs,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.479
text areas, selects, things like that,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.796
because a lot of those form
elements will not inherit from the body.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.799
Speaking of resetting things
and keeping them in their containers,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.839
make sure that things
like embeds, iframes,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.880
and objects stay inside their containers.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.800
I have seen countless
themes not include this code.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.799
It's very simple.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.863
Iframe, max width 100%.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.320
The reason is I have two images here.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.919
One shows the YouTube video

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.439
nicely contained
within the area of the website,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.679
and the other shows
the YouTube video way off to the side.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.573
Most of the video won't be visible.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.199
While we're talking
about defaults and resets,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.008
you want to make sure
to leave the browser alone.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.559
I have seen all sorts
of interesting and strange CSS

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.080
and JavaScript hacks that change
the settings of the browser.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.199
Browsers are people's comfort space.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.479
They are visiting your website
in the context of all other websites

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.794
that they have ever visited.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.399
They're usually visiting
it in the context of a search engine

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.999
or a social media site that they were just

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.900
on before they came to your website,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.679
so make sure
that their browser still looks

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.439
like the thing they know and trust.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.879
I have had reports
from clients where they insisted

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.133
upon changing things like the scroll bar.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.479
What happened?

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.719
Their customers called them
and told them their website was hacked

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.879
because things didn't look
the way the person expected them to.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.159
It's very important to meet
people's expectations.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.317
One of those expectations
is that the browser looks a certain way.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.799
Don't change the scroll speed.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.599
I have seen quite a few themes that think

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.840
it's a great idea to change
how fast scrolling goes.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.919
Here's the thing.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.236
My hand has muscle memory
for how fast a page is supposed to scroll.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.059
When I take my hand and I put it

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.640
on my mouse or my trackpad and I scroll,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.359
I know how much my hand
is supposed to move

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.559
to get a certain amount of screen scroll.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.559
When your website doesn't work that way,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.459
it's like someone took
my mouse away from me

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.479
and handed me some other input device,
and I'm like, this isn't mine.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.319
Take it away. I want mine back.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.440
I want this to meet my expectations.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.749
Another thing, the cursor.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.599
Please just leave the cursor alone.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.039
We do not actually want a trail of stars
following us around your website.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.399
It can be very, very distracting
and disorienting to a lot of people.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.240
Again, it may look
like your website is hacked.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.600
Meet the expectations of the user.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800
Screen reader text.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.999
Your themes should be supporting
screen reader text as a CSS class.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.399
This has been included

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.679
as a WordPress recommended
class for themes for quite a while.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.699
This allows us to hide text visually

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.559
that is primarily needed
for screen reader users.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.559
The most common, of course,
is the skip to content link.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.319
It can also be used
for things like changing

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.239
your blog button
from read more, read more,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.921
read more all over the page to read
more about cute puppies.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.499
Great.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.659
Now I know what I'm reading more about.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.199
This also allows the links,
when they're pulled by a screen reader,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.479
to have useful content,
because they can tell

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.939
the difference between read more about

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.510
cute puppies and read
more about cute kittens.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.399
How that looks in HTML
is you'll have an anchor tag

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.880
with an href for the URL.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.079
Then you'll have read
more or continue reading.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.285
Then you'll have a span class
with screen reader text.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.439
That's where the information about
cute puppies or cute kittens,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.839
or whatever the actual blog
post title is goes,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.680
is in that span tag inside of the anchor.

00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:17.279
Align wide and align full.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.720
These are classes
used by the block editor.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.399
If you're using the block editor,
your theme should be supporting these.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.556
If it's not, well, we have the code handy.

00:24:28.557 --> 00:24:31.840
Align full means full.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.279
The complete full width of the browser.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.600
Align wide means wider than typical.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.079
It does not necessarily mean
all the way to the edge of the browser.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.919
How I normally implement
this is the class align full.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.482
I'll put a margin of 32 pixels.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:00.000
I will use a calc
on this for 50% minus 50VW.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.440
That is viewport width.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.595
The 32 is the scroll bar on the right.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.041
Then I will set a max width
of 100 VW and a width of 100 VW.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.119
On the class align wide,
I'll do the same thing,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.719
but I'll subtract just
a little bit off of the margin,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.365
which is an additional 8 pixels.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.460
I will set the max width to 1,800 pixels.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.539
A typical website
is going to be around 1,100

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.476
or 1,200 pixels for the main content.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.920
This will allow our align
wides to go wider than that.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.800
Some people use computer screens
that are nearly 3,000 pixels wide.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.959
We don't necessarily want
it going all the way to those edges.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.720
That's why I put the max width
in on that for the align wide.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.879
Align left, align right, and align center.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.434
These have been used for image
alignments in WordPress for a long time.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.719
All of your themes should support them,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.639
but just in case they don't,
we've got the code here.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.180
For the class align left,
we have display inline,

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.220
float left, margin right of 1.5 EM.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.039
EM is a relative unit,
so that will become a little bit wider

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.673
as if the person increases their font
size, for example, on the website.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.199
Then for align center, we'll clear both,
display block, and we'll set

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.120
the margin on the left and
the right to auto to center it out.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.440
Now for making text easier to read.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.159
Setting up your fonts.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.439
I've had a lot of people ask,
but what do I set for my fonts?

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.320
You want to use rems, not pixels.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.439
On the HTML, I will set font size to 100,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.179
and on the body,
I will set font size to 1 rem.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.119
1 rem means what this person
has set up in their browser as a default.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.999
Some people like large text.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.893
If they do, I want to respect that.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.879
Next, you want to set your line height.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.319
Set a reasonable relative line height.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.599
Don't use pixels.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.800
I repeat, do not use
pixels for line height.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.799
I have seen numerous,
numerous plugins trying to use pixels

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.479
for line height and fixed height.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.920
That means people can't resize their text.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.360
This causes lots of accessibility issues.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.842
Normally on most content,
I will use a line height of 1.5.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.879
That's already set
as a relative line height.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.492
That means 1.5 times
whatever the heck the font size is.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.165
That's normally pretty readable.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.000
When to use what units.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.279
If you're using a font size,
it should be done in rems.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.680
If you are using a font weight,
this is in 300 to 700.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.639
You want to avoid anything less than 300.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.639
That tends to be a really light font

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.519
weight and can be very difficult to read.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:39.079
I have attempted to read on my phone
100 weight font in bright sunlight.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.239
It doesn't matter if it's black on white,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.255
it is still nearly impossible to read.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.979
Also avoid super heavy,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.039
which would be font
weights greater than 700.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.999
Those can be just
so chunky and thick that,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.332
again, I can't really read it on my phone.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.399
Line heights are in relative
units because you always want

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.319
your line height to be scaled
based on your font size.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.319
Typically speaking,
when you're doing paddings and margins,

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.999
I keep them in pixels
because I don't want them

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.126
becoming huge just
because someone wants larger text.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.359
When you're working with clients
and you are choosing fonts,

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.600
you want to get
the client's mindset in place.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.959
We are going to use text
that you are unfamiliar with.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.239
We're using it because your visitors

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.493
are unfamiliar with your website content.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.239
This way, clients are forced to actually
read the content in the font,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.885
not just look at the aesthetics.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.306
I generally use pangrams.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.199
Those are sentences
that contain all of the letters

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.840
in the alphabet at least once.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.239
These are normally written for brevity

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.959
and can be quite difficult to read,
which is great because it forces

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.896
your client to actually try and read.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.280
For example, the quick brown
fox jumps over the lazy dog.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.599
When you're working with body fonts,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.759
the main text of your website,
stick to sans serif.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.719
It is mostly agreed upon that sans
serif is the easiest to read

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.719
on a computer for large blocks of text.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.499
In print, it's actually the reverse

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.062
and a lot of people like serif.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.880
I've got a link to a font examples page

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.359
and this has a whole bunch
of font examples,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.160
including website fonts
and some of the Google fonts.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.239
This gives you an example
of several pangrams,

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.760
numbers, some of
the common mirrored letters,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.119
all of the uppercase letters,
all of those weird,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.559
crazy symbols that you didn't even think
you might use at some point,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.320
including curly quotes,
curly single quotes, straight quotes,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.612
lots of different things,
italics and bolds,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.760
and works on the I-L-L-I combos.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.479
Those can be really tricky to read

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.320
depending on the font as they can get
really smushed together.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.735
There's a bunch of useful stuff there.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.119
Generally speaking,
if you are picking out a body font,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.839
I prefer a little bit wider fonts.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.559
I have talked to quite a number of people
of different age ranges,

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.759
different backgrounds, different vision
levels, and generally speaking,

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.999
if I give them this block
of text in Arial versus Verdana,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.400
they're going to pick
Verdana the majority of the time.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.580
Obviously, not everyone is the same.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.259
Another reason why I like Verdana better

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.840
is the I uppercase and the l lowercase
actually look different.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.639
When we're talking about fonts,

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.239
we want to make sure
to include a fallback font,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.000
otherwise it goes to whatever
the heck the system default is.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.759
If I am using a sans serif font,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.799
like, for example, Lato,
that's a popular one,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.920
I will specify a system font,
so Verdana, as a fallback,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.399
and then just in case, I will also specify
sans serif as the fallback,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.719
just to make sure
that if there's ever an issue loading

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.687
the font I wanted,
something decent still shows up.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.440
Letter spacing on your fonts.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.819
I almost always use
a little bit of a letter spacing

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.440
on my fonts, especially my body fonts.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.479
Here's an example of a 0.015
EM letter spacing.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:07.668
EM is a relative unit, so however big
the font is, it will be relative to that.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.839
Here you can see the Arial font
on the left and the Arial font

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.919
with a little bit of spacing on the right.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.199
It just makes
some of the words like willing,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.439
billing, drilling,
a little bit easier to read,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.040
and helps prevent things like an nn
from becoming an m visually.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.960
Another one I will commonly
use is 0.2 pixels.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.559
Gen, you just said that we're supposed

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.240
to use relative weights
for the letter spacing.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:46.513
The thing about fonts is as they get
bigger, they become easier to read.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.399
While I needed more letter
spacing at a smaller font size,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.320
I actually need less letter
spacing at a larger font size.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.599
Using 0.2 pixels
decreases the letter spacing

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.831
as the font size increases.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.007
I found it actually works
out pretty well visually.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.479
List items.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.290
We all have lists on our websites.

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.398
Here's an example of the ID content, LI.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:27.320
I put padding bottom of 0.7 rem,
back to the relative units.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.119
The reason is it spaces
out my bullet points

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.840
and makes them
a lot easier to scan and read.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.440
Making your links easier to see.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.120
You want to set your word
wrap on your links.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.079
This is how you prevent
your link from running

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.333
off the right side of your mobile screen.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:01.880
You'll set your anchor with display
inline, word wrap, break word.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.600
Underlines on your links.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.879
I love to push down the underline just
a little bit so that it doesn't get

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.619
broken by things
like parentheses or lowercase j's

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.220
or lowercase p's, or y's, et cetera.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.359
If you feel like it,
you can add a different color.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.359
I have the anchor,
text underline offset 4 pixels.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.680
I found that's just about the sweet spot.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.959
Text decoration color, blue violet,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.159
just to give a slightly different color
to the underline.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.127
Helps make the link pop
a little bit more visually.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.120
Check boxes and radios.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.799
In WCAG 2.2,
there was a new requirement saying

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.039
make things big enough to click on them.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.007
Or more specifically,
make them at least 24 pixels.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.399
By default, check boxes and radios
are rendered smaller than that.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.520
I like to set min width and min--

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.559
sorry, that's supposed to say min height.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.519
I'll fix that in my slides after.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.700
Min height, 24 pixels.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:21.187
I also set a width of 1.5
rem and a height of 1.5 rem.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.572
That means that they're
at least 24 pixels,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.679
but then they can grow bigger,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.239
because typically if someone
wants a larger font,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.919
that's because they don't see

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.040
as well, so giving them a bigger area
to target is a big improvement for them.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.079
Don't forget your visited
on your anchor links.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.480
Make sure to list anchor
and also anchor with the state visited.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.440
Focus state,
the theme of this whole thing.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.399
When you're setting your focus state,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.919
you want to use two different colors.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.565
Typically, I use blue and white.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.120
Don't ask your client about the focus.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.199
They don't have an informed opinion.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.759
They don't need one.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.479
Just set it for them.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.399
Here you can see on each of these,
the focus is visually clear.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.239
What about when the client says,

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.879
we've got a blue background,
a white button,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.773
and it's just going to be a border?

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.619
Great.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.359
Your blue and white
combo is no longer visible,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.199
because that's the default state
of the button.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.722
This is where your dashed
border becomes your best friend.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.559
Here I have an example
of the unfocused state

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.560
and the focused state,
and we have a dashed border.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.959
Yes, I used!important.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.975
That's to override all of the plugins.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.960
Because they overrode whatever I set.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.720
Some helper classes.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.239
I like to set up
a few different helper classes.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.879
I have white text as a class.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.639
I find this is really handy.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.679
Clients always want
somewhere on their website

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.399
to have white text on a dark background.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.719
Here we just add white text.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.282
It's easy for them to remember.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.199
Text size.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.399
Again, clients always want
to change the size of text.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.559
The block editor wants
to put that in with inline styles,

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.461
which we want to avoid.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.479
We have a class.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.759
Here's an example.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.479
Body, class, extra large text.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.042
I have a font size of 1.5 rems.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.040
Margins and paddings.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.919
A whole bunch of things
in the block editor

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.719
don't have anything
to set margins or paddings.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.759
All we have is that little block

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.251
at the end in advanced
that says CSS classes.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.199
Here I have a bunch of really handy
CSS classes that I can toss in.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.390
For example,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:10.360
MT100 gives me margin top 100 pixels.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.759
Again, I use the!important
because I have to override whatever

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.279
is going on with the builder
or the various plugins

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.059
installed on the site,
because this is something

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.344
the user is putting
in and they really want it to work.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.559
Z index, I also include.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.300
For example, class Z0.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.811
That's just the index zero.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.280
The last class is flexbox.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.279
This is really handy.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.879
If you don't know all about flexbox,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:51.759
the CSS tricks guide has a wonderful,
wonderful guide on flexbox.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.239
I have this printed out.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.879
It is near me.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.039
I can reference it all the time.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.520
It is just a really fabulous
introduction to flexbox and how to use it.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.134
I have a class in my theme for flexbox.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.520
I also have flexbox non-responsive.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.640
This means I still want
it to be flexbox even on mobile.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.690
My standard flexbox,
I have a min width of 768 pixels.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.320
Make sure to include
a gap in your flexbox.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.085
I like about 30 pixels as a gap.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.519
That is CSS tiny tips.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.080
CSS basics and overrides.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.122
WordPress and browser defaults.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.079
Making text easier to read.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.600
Making links easier to see.

00:40:49.037 --> 00:40:50.525
Helper classes.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.399
We have questions, I'm sure.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.299
Slides and links are available

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:01.180
at easya11yguide.com/learn.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.766
You can find me online
at the website or on LinkedIn.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.040
Simon: Thank you, Gen.

00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:10.919
That was absolutely fantastic.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.879
I think there was something
for everyone to take away.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.368
Gen: I hope so.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.732
Simon: Just a lot
of great stuff as always.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.199
We do have some questions
as you predicted.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.183
I'll start from the top.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.439
Someone asked,
"How do you prevent duplicating blocks

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.879
of CSS with the same class name?

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.400
Or how do you prevent
duplicate block/CSS class names?"

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.119
Something like this happens
when there are multiple

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.840
plug-ins or developers
on the same project.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.079
Gen: Of course, communication.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.679
You just need to communicate
with each other what is,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.839
who's going to do what, what your naming
practices are going to be,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.799
where you're going to put all of that.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.279
Of course, use
Git so that you are all sharing your code

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.612
and you can see what each other are doing.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.369
Simon: Great.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.631
David asks,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.658
"What are your recommended
font family pairings for blog posts?"

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.128
Gen: There's a lot of different fonts
that I like.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.680
I've got a couple examples
on my font examples page.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.119
If I'm just going to stick
to website fonts,

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.319
I would probably use
Tahoma for headings and Verdana for body.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.920
If I'm going to go with Google fonts,
I like to pull in,

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:50.000
let's see-- kind of a big fan
of Lato sometimes.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.239
Or using Nunito Sans.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.140
That is another one of my favorites.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.119
For headings, I particularly like PT Sans.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.611
Just personally
like that one a lot visually.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.960
Simon: Nice.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.440
Reg asks, he says, "Thank you so much

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:25.280
for the tip regarding bottom
padding for list items

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.959
and as well as all of your other tips.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.939
To mitigate against the last item

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.420
in a list generating unwanted extra space

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.319
at the bottom of the list,

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.279
would you recommend
tweaking the bottom padding

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.000
of the last item or the list itself?"

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.359
Gen: Often, the UL or OL element

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.439
will have its own bottom
padding from the reset sheet.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.279
What I usually do is I eliminate
that and leave

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.099
the actual list item
to have some bottom padding

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.559
because I like a little bit of space
at the end of the list,

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.419
just like I like a little bit of space
at the end of a paragraph

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.514
before we get to the next HTML element.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.634
Simon: Makes a lot of sense.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.240
Nick asks, or says,
"You mentioned lowering the underline,

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.941
but I'm wondering about

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:36.040
using text decoration hip link,

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.379
which will allow it to not cross

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.859
through J, G, et cetera."

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.199
Things with tails
underneath them, I guess.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.319
"What do you think of using that?

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.880
Currently browser support
is partial on most modern browsers."

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.566
Gen: The answer is it's partial
support on browsers.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.079
I work with a lot of different clients
and a lot of different websites,

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.279
and I develop a theme and I don't know
where it's going to be used,

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.960
so I stick to things
with very high support.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.719
I try to avoid the partial supports,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.759
although some
of the partial support things

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.719
are really fun and I want to play
with them, but I develop a theme,

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.132
so I need to stick
with what's broadly used.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.659
Simon: Great.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.553
We have a couple folks asking about

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.400
large or extremely big text on websites.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:47.526
Sometimes it takes a whole screen
because the designers of the H1,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.720
H2 tags do it really bold.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.243
Basically how should these behave
in the case of zooming?

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.880
Gen: You should zoom.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.959
The zoom should happen
as the zoom happens.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.999
That is a browser control.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.079
That is something that the user controls.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.839
The designer should not be using
absolutely massive H1 and H2s,

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:20.479
in my opinion, that,
especially when it's you have something

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.119
in the neighborhood of 6 rems,

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.239
and then you're dropping
down to 1 rem for the font size,

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.759
and you're like, oh my God,

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.479
that is just way too much
difference between them.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.880
I really try to cap out
even H1s at about 3 rems,

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.000
or three times the body font size.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.240
Simon: Makes sense.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.079
One more question right here.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.579
Mark asks, "When is there a time

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.720
and when is it to just use system fonts?"

00:46:54.680 --> 00:47:00.520
Gen: There are plenty of websites
that I use Verdana for the body font.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.159
It's supported.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.319
It's on every device.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.799
I don't have to worry about loading it.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.279
Especially if I'm working
with a client who wants

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.319
just something built quickly.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.199
They don't want to fuss over stuff.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.374
I'll just go ahead and use system fonts.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.000
Works great.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.329
Simon: Great.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.202
That finishes up our questions.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.719
I just want to thank you again.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.639
I personally have really benefited

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.959
from all the resources on Easy A11y Guide.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.359
I would encourage everybody
here to check that out.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.834
You just provided so many great videos
and tools for fonts and colors.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.959
Thank you so much
for that and for your presentation today.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.640
Really great stuff.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.519
Gen: It was a pleasure being here, Simon.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.503
Thank you for having me.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.125
Simon: Thank the organizer team.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.480
I'm just the emcee.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.999
