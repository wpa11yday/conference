Announcer: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.853
Developing Accessible Gutenberg Blocks

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.573
with Speaker Kevin Sholander,

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:09.866
Senior Web Developer at CodeGeek.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.506
This presentation was recorded
October 2024.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.600
Jessica Sams: Hello everyone.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.120
This is WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.893
My name is Jessica Sams from Yalantis,
website mentor.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.626
Thank you for joining us for

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:31.400
Developing Accessible Gutenberg Blocks

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.373
with Kevin Sholander.

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:38.080
Feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.546
That's the icon with a question mark on it

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.800
if you want us to see it and respond to it.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.080
You can add your questions
as you think of them,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.733
and then we will do our best to respond
at the end of the session.

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:54.040
Use the chat icon to connect
with other attendees

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:57.680
and keep your eye on it for messages
from our tech support.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.946
Let me go ahead and introduce Kevin.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:04.813
Kevin's a senior web developer at CodeGeek

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.480
where he has spent the past five years
creating accessible

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:11.240
and user-friendly digital experiences.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.266
Specializing in web accessibility,
Kevin ensures

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:18.746
that websites and applications
are designed to serve users of all abilities,

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.906
benefiting a diverse range of clients

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.720
from local businesses
to international corporations.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.400
Before joining CodeGeek,

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.706
Kevin spent some time
as an adjunct instructor

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:36.173
of web development
and computer information systems

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:38.026
at the local community college.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.666
He also had a previous career
in hardware engineering,

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:46.000
designing CPU and GPU silicon for AMD,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.133
HP, and National Semiconductor.

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:51.426
In addition to his professional work,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.986
Kevin is also an entrepreneur
designing, constructing,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.560
and running The Markey Escape Rooms
in Fort Collins, Colorado,

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:00.760
with his family.

00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:03.400
Kevin, are you ready to take it away?

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:05.880
Kevin Sholander: I sure am.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.946
Let's get my screen share going.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.426
Thank you, Jessica,
for that nice introduction.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:20.413
Let's see.
As Jessica stated, I'm Kevin Sholander,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.506
and we're going to spend the next 50 minutes

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.253
or so talking about developing accessible
Gutenberg blocks.

00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:33.773
There's going to be a lot of interesting links,
I hope, at least for everyone.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.253
There's sites that I have bookmarked
that I refer to every day

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:41.853
that I've linked in this document
in the resources section.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.613
If you haven't had a chance to connect
with the document

00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:46.946
with the slide deck,

00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:51.626
you can download it from the WordPress
Accessibility Day schedule site

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280
or use the QR code that's here.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.573
Before we get started,

00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:01.960
I want to give a shout-out to
a previous session that I saw today that,

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.280
if you didn't catch it earlier,

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:08.653
Natalie MacLees
gave an excellent presentation

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:12.893
on accessibility challenges
with single-page applications

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.786
that I personally found
was very interesting.

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:18.293
If you're interested
in what I'm going to be talking about

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.120
and you didn't see her presentation,

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.173
I can only wish to present as well as she did.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:27.680
Go back and watch that
when the recording is available.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.080
Jessica covered everything about me,

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.186
so I'm going to just skip on over
so that we can get started.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.586
This presentation is designed
for web developers

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:46.560
building custom themes and or plugins
in the WordPress environment.

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:51.960
I'm expecting that you're coming
into this presentation

00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:56.413
with some knowledge of HTML, PHP,
CSS, JavaScript,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.026
the basic building blocks of the web.

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:05.800
If you are just here because you want to see
how things are put together,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.746
that's fine too.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.760
You'll get a drink
from the fire hose maybe a little bit.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:20.466
I'm trying to make this
a more advanced presentation

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:24.800
so that any developers out there
who have been sitting

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.893
in through all the other sessions today
and saying,

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.613
"Well, this is all really good,
interesting information.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.240
How do I actually apply it?"

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.413
That's what this presentation is about.

00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:36.906
Towards the end of this presentation,

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:42.146
I hope to give some demos on keyboard testing
and screen readers

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.440
so that give you some skills
that you might use for testing your own sites.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:51.280
Before we start,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.346
I want to say what accessibility means to me
as a developer.

00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:59.280
Everybody probably comes into this
a little bit differently.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.506
For me,
what accessibility means is that the code

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.133
that I developed is going
to provide consistent

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.040
and conformant set of behaviors
and structures

00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:11.746
so that users can experience

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.613
and interact with the sites that I build

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.493
using whatever technology works best
for them.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.586
I deliberately leave out things
like screen readers

00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:25.093
and keyboard navigation.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.800
That's not what I mean by accessibility.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.026
What I hope is that when I design a site,
it is responsive.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.413
It works well on all devices.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.893
If you're accessing the site through
a mobile device

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:41.266
or a laptop or a desktop machine,

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:45.626
you will have a rewarding experience

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:49.120
and get the information
that you're trying to get to.

00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:53.373
If you're using a screen reader or a keyboard,

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:55.680
I hope the same.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.000
Accessibility encompasses
all the technologies that are out there

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:05.026
for accessing and reading and interacting
with the websites.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600
We use tools like BrowserStack

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.706
and screen readers like VoiceOver

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.866
and whatnot to test that all
of the custom code

00:06:18.893 --> 00:06:23.946
that we built is truly accessible
to the maximum number of users.

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:28.840
In this presentation,

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.293
we're going to be looking at
a particular Gutenberg block

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:35.146
that I put together that the code
is available to everyone

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.520
through GitHub
or you can download the zip file

00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:45.266
from the WordPress Accessibility Day
details for this presentation.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.293
The Gutenberg block that I chose to
implement is a button with a pop-up.

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:54.520
Very simple.

00:06:54.573 --> 00:06:56.560
You click the button, pop-up opens.

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:02.826
At this point, we're going to leave
the slides behind and start looking at

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.053
what it is we're building and some code.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:16.520
I'm going to start by showing you,
here's an example usage of this button,

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:18.106
this Contact Us.

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:20.653
You click it, it opens a contact form.

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:22.066
You can fill out information.

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.293
You can click to submit.

00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:26.680
Then there's a close button
to toggle it on and off.

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:34.386
On the back end,
what that looks like is it's a Gutenberg block.

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:39.426
We can go into a page editor
and add the block in here.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.466
If I want to add a new version of this,

00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:47.746
I can pick it out from the list.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.533
Accessible pop-up.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.240
You can see there's a blank button.

00:07:54.893 --> 00:07:57.906
The empty pop-up shows up
automatically there

00:07:57.946 --> 00:07:59.866
when you add the block in there.

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:05.626
Then there are some ACF fields that can be
filled out here to add the button label.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:09.253
Whatever we want to put in here,
we'll just use button label.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.546
Then we need a new default pop-up.

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:18.573
There we go.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.506
That will add a title to my pop-up when it opens.

00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:26.920
Then because it's Gutenberg
and we're working in blocks,

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:31.040
we can add blocks
into our pop-up to add content.

00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:34.853
Let's say I want to put a paragraph
in here that says,

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:40.400
please fill out the form below.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.080
I can put whatever I want in here.
It doesn't matter.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.480
Add other blocks in here.

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:52.693
If I want to add a form block,
I can select the contact form.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.160
There it is.

00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:57.293
I've built myself a pop-up
that has a contact form in it.

00:08:59.146 --> 00:09:03.240
I've added a couple of features
that are available in the Gutenberg editor

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:06.586
under the Advanced tab.

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:11.946
I've enabled the addition of a custom anchor
or additional CSS classes.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.240
I'll show you that in just a moment
where that comes from.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.733
Then I've also added just
the bare minimum amount of styling

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:25.840
so that I can give an example of how
it's done without overcomplicating the code.

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:32.173
Let's see if I can add some top
and bottom padding

00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:38.106
and left and right padding to it
to make my block

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:40.480
look like what I would like it to look like
on the front end.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.346
Click Save. I can go back to the page.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.266
Load that up.

00:09:51.493 --> 00:09:53.426
Actually, I added extras.

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:55.200
Here's my beautiful pop-up.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.480
Please fill out the form below and you can see
the padding and stuff show up there.

00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:05.626
I'm going to remove the ones I got wrong.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.520
Let's delete that.

00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:12.280
We'll take that one as well.
It was a practice from earlier.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.373
All right.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.586
Let's look at the code
that makes this possible.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.933
When you download the zip file,
you'll find a README file.

00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:28.320
There's some notes
in there about considerations

00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:31.066
that I was making as I built this block.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.720
There's some accessibility considerations
in there.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.373
Things that we need to make sure
that this block does.

00:10:41.546 --> 00:10:45.160
We'll look at each of these features
as we step through.

00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:49.400
Then if you want to try out this block
in your own theme

00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:50.680
or your own plugin,

00:10:51.186 --> 00:10:55.186
all you have to do is clone the repo
into your theme or plugin,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.720
add this require once line
to your functions.php

00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:03.920
or your plugins.php code,

00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:08.546
and then you're good to go to insert
the block into the page editor.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:13.853
Note that I developed this block
using the ACF Pro plugin

00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:16.186
just because it's accessible to me.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.293
We have the license here and we use it
frequently for all kinds of things.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:26.506
It gives access to the ACF fields
and whatnot in the back end.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:33.706
If you would like to develop your blocks
using native React code,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.440
that won't change any of the concepts
that we're going to look at here.

00:11:38.493 --> 00:11:40.413
This block requires ACF Pro,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.480
but you can certainly rewrite this stuff
into React if you choose.

00:11:46.626 --> 00:11:53.586
Looking at the individual files,
WordPress expects a block.json file.

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:58.480
This file defines some
of the properties of our block.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.266
It doesn't give much functionality,
but it tells what the name of the block is.

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:06.613
We've got a keyword list here.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.400
There's the icon that's going to be used when
you're working with the block in the editor.

00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:16.306
A description so that people will know
what it does.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:22.106
Some of that stuff shows up here
in the block editor.

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:28.493
It's just there to make life useful
for the authors

00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:30.653
that are going to be adding
your block to the page.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Also in here is a script that's going to be
enqueued on the front end.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.640
Note that if you're writing
a React native block,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.826
you're also going to have
a back-end script that's going to contain

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.186
your back-end JavaScript
that actually renders the block.

00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:51.760
There's a CSS file that I've thrown
in here for this popup.

00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:55.986
Because this is an ACF block,
there's an ACF section in here

00:12:56.013 --> 00:13:00.733
that has a pointer to a PHP file that acts
as our render callback.

00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:03.613
That's going to be called
whenever the block is rendered

00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:05.960
on either the front end or the back end.

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:10.560
Then here is a section of properties.

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:15.946
This defines what features
of the Gutenberg editor that we want to use.

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:23.586
As we saw earlier, we've got the anchor
and the classes that I'm supporting.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.533
That's defined
in this supports properties here,

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:29.293
anchor, and custom class name.

00:13:29.453 --> 00:13:31.600
Then this is the spacing.

00:13:32.013 --> 00:13:36.493
I turned on padding
so that we can adjust padding in the back end.

00:13:38.093 --> 00:13:42.533
I'm going to point out this extra one down here
at the bottom, JSX.

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:48.480
I set that to true because that allows
my block to behave as a container

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:51.213
that can hold other blocks.

00:13:51.826 --> 00:13:56.520
That's what gives me the ability to drag
and drop things

00:13:56.613 --> 00:14:01.253
into my block
and add more content inside of that block.

00:14:03.613 --> 00:14:09.866
Moving on to the popup.php file,
this is really the heart, the guts of the block.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.626
This is where all of the logic lives.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.866
I've created a class called popup

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:22.346
and not to get overly technical,
but it is a singleton class,

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:25.480
meaning that there's only going to be
one instance of this popup

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:31.080
that exists at any time during the execution
of all of the WordPress code.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.146
Regardless of how many popups
there are on a page.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.000
I control that by creating
this init function that says,

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:45.360
if an instance of this object already exists,
then just return that instance.

00:14:45.453 --> 00:14:48.000
Otherwise, if it doesn't exist,
let's create a new one.

00:14:48.733 --> 00:14:51.093
There's a constructor here,

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:56.533
and this is where the first time
that the block gets called.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.320
We are going to inform WordPress

00:15:01.613 --> 00:15:04.746
that we have a new block that we're creating,
register block type,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.653
look in this directory,
find the block.json file,

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:12.813
and use that to enqueue all the assets
that are needed for the block.

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:17.106
It adds it into the backend in Gutenberg

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:21.333
and just generally informs WordPress
what's going on.

00:15:22.493 --> 00:15:28.813
Similarly, there's a call
that we're making here to ACF to say,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.080
hey, we've got an ACF.json file
in this folder as well.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.946
When ACF boots up and it's going through all
of its initializations,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.906
please include our ACF.json in that.

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:45.053
That way we'll get the form groups

00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:50.173
that show up for entering our button labels
and popup title and stuff.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.200
There's a helper function
in here called decodeSpacing

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:59.880
that I found that I needed at some point and
I rewrote it a few times and then decided,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.666
hey, it's going to be part of the class
and it's always going to live here.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:12.133
When Gutenberg passes back the information
that we set in for the padding

00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:13.860
or for other spacing,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.586
like margins or whatnot,

00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:26.720
it passes back either a variable name
or a CSS unit for distance,

00:16:26.773 --> 00:16:31.386
like 10 pixels or 3 rems
or something like that.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.106
This is just a quick helper function
that looks at what gets passed back

00:16:36.146 --> 00:16:39.506
from Gutenberg and converts it
into something that I can use

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.146
at adding styles to my block.

00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:44.866
All right.

00:16:44.906 --> 00:16:51.000
Here, the display block,
this is our rendering portion of the code,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.386
and this is where the rubber meets the road.

00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:55.080
This is where everything happens.

00:16:56.506 --> 00:17:00.400
In this display block, this gets called
whether we're rendering on the front end

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:01.546
or on the back end.

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:07.160
Gutenberg is going to say,
"Hey, we need to display this block on the page,"

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.733
and it passes us some information
about the settings

00:17:10.773 --> 00:17:14.160
that were made in Gutenberg,
some of the contents.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.613
This is preview is helpful.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.226
It tells us essentially
whether we're in the editor

00:17:20.293 --> 00:17:21.813
or whether we're on the front end.

00:17:22.386 --> 00:17:25.333
Then there's some other information
that gets passed in here.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.173
This block doesn't use them all,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.400
but I listed them all just
in case people want to dive in

00:17:32.453 --> 00:17:34.106
and see what's there.

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:38.640
I start out by parsing out
all the information from the block

00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:41.373
that Gutenberg gives us.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:49.586
If the author has entered an anchor here,
we're going to grab that anchor.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.893
Otherwise,
we're just going to generate a unique one.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.666
Grab the class names in case they've typed
in a class name in the editor.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.013
We're going to ask ACF to please provide us
with the button label

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.186
and the pop-up title that were entered
when the block was added in Gutenberg.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.920
Then here's the code
that uses that decode spacing

00:18:12.973 --> 00:18:19.746
that parses out all the different spacing
for padding-left,

00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:21.933
padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom.

00:18:23.013 --> 00:18:26.466
If I were going to do margins,
it would look identical to this.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.586
All right.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.466
That's all background stuff.
Here is the real stuff.

00:18:32.533 --> 00:18:35.200
This is where the magic happens.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.506
In the web world,
all of our content is delivered as HTML.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.933
The purpose of all this code is
to generate HTML

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:48.400
and to generate it in an accessible way.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.506
The most important thing,

00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:54.253
if you only leave with one thing
from this presentation,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.080
it's that when writing HTML,

00:18:57.573 --> 00:19:00.426
semantic HTML is the only way to do it.

00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:05.226
If you're not familiar with semantic HTML,

00:19:05.613 --> 00:19:10.720
what that really means is HTML provides us

00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:14.360
with a large vocabulary
of different elements,

00:19:14.493 --> 00:19:17.013
and each one has an intended purpose.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.960
If you use the right element
for its intended purpose,

00:19:22.506 --> 00:19:27.186
most of your work
in accessibility will be done already.

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:30.400
It'll be done for you by the browser itself.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.426
For instance, I have added a button to the site,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:44.066
and that button reload
with just the one button on there.

00:19:45.626 --> 00:19:47.920
That button is a button,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.800
and you've probably had this drilled
into you many times today,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.320
but if you haven't, here it is.

00:19:55.026 --> 00:19:59.853
A button is an element that when clicked on,
it doesn't action.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.466
It does something.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.040
It changes some state on the page.

00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:08.293
A link is an element on the page
that when you click on it,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.680
it takes you somewhere.

00:20:12.573 --> 00:20:17.760
This button,
I shouldn't have, but I could have used,

00:20:17.826 --> 00:20:20.600
say, a div element in its place here.

00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:25.280
If I save that as a div,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.760
you'll see that we still have the Contact Us.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.066
It still looks the same.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.653
I could still click on it,
and it works just fine,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.440
but it's not semantically correct.

00:20:34.506 --> 00:20:35.920
It's a div element,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.960
and you may not notice it when you're testing,

00:20:38.986 --> 00:20:42.240
but if you do keyboard testing
and I start tabbing through,

00:20:42.653 --> 00:20:47.453
you can see my focus state is indicated
by this little orange box here.

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.120
When I tab from here,

00:20:49.426 --> 00:20:52.533
I would expect it to land on
the next interactive element,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.706
and when I hit tab,

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:56.480
it takes me all the way down to the footer
and skips my button.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.706
Why does it skip the button?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.840
Well, a div is not an interactive element.

00:21:02.106 --> 00:21:06.106
The browser doesn't know
what you're trying to do with that div,

00:21:06.146 --> 00:21:09.853
so you might be inclined to then say,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.600
"Well, why don't I add a roll of buttoning to it?"

00:21:12.893 --> 00:21:14.586
That will now make it a button.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.053
Yes and no.

00:21:20.066 --> 00:21:22.466
Screen readers will call it out as
if it is a button,

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:25.813
but I still can't tab to it.
I'm hitting the tab and going over it.

00:21:26.013 --> 00:21:29.680
Buttons have a lot more than
just a role assigned to them.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.413
They do a whole bunch of other things,

00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:36.760
so then you're going to have to add tab index
and other things,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.920
and it just gets really, really messy

00:21:38.973 --> 00:21:43.880
when you're starting to add all
of this area code to something,

00:21:44.066 --> 00:21:49.586
whereas if you just use
the correct semantic element to begin with,

00:21:50.026 --> 00:21:53.053
you get all that work done
for you by the browser.

00:21:54.653 --> 00:21:57.280
If that's all you leave
with from this presentation,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.760
I would be happy enough.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.200
All right.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.786
Generally, building blocks in Gutenberg,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.146
you're not going to have to use a lot of area

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.573
unless you're building
some interactive UI-type thing,

00:22:17.693 --> 00:22:19.333
which we are in this case.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.880
I wanted to come up with
an example that required

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:25.653
at least some area so that
you can see how it's done.

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:38.533
Generally, no area is better than bad area.

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:45.493
If you don't really know for sure
what you need to add,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.053
if you don't add anything,
you're making not a bad choice.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.640
However, for this particular button,
I've added a bunch of area

00:22:57.693 --> 00:23:00.733
because I want to tell the screen readers and,

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.853
through them, tell the user
what it is this button is going to do,

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:10.013
so that they have an idea when they click on it
and whether they want to click on it first,

00:23:10.093 --> 00:23:12.680
and then what's going to happen.

00:23:15.066 --> 00:23:20.066
This button has a pop-up that will be
announced by the screen reader.

00:23:20.213 --> 00:23:22.306
You're on a button. It has a pop-up.

00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:25.053
The pop-up type is dialogue.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.280
You'll often see just a true put in there,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.573
and that means the pop-up type is a menu.

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:37.226
That's the default setting for area has pop-up.

00:23:37.586 --> 00:23:41.080
You could also specifically
call out menu there.

00:23:41.613 --> 00:23:44.213
In this case, I'm opening a dialogue.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.946
I would like it to be announced as a dialogue
so the user's not surprised.

00:23:47.973 --> 00:23:50.826
They're not looking for a menu
and then find a dialogue.

00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:55.853
This is what's known as a state.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.866
Area has states, roles, and properties.

00:24:01.293 --> 00:24:02.506
This one's a state.

00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:06.453
What I showed you earlier, role is button.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.320
The role indicates what the purpose
of the element is.

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.400
Sorry, this is a property, not a state.
Understood.

00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:21.253
The property is it has a pop-up.

00:24:22.066 --> 00:24:26.760
A state is something that is going to change
as the button does its thing.

00:24:26.813 --> 00:24:29.546
If you click on it, the button may change state.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.093
In this case, area expanded is the state.

00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:39.066
That tells us is the pop-up that talked
about on the previous line,

00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:40.773
is it open or is it closed?

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.240
Area expanded false means that
when we first load the page,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.506
the pop-up is not open.

00:24:46.786 --> 00:24:50.346
When we click the button,
we would like that state to change.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.733
The browser is not going to
control those states for us.

00:24:53.773 --> 00:24:58.813
We're going to have to write some JavaScript
in order to manage the area states.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.466
There's another property here, area controls.

00:25:03.813 --> 00:25:08.000
What that does is it ties
this button together

00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:11.453
with the dialogue that's being controlled.

00:25:12.426 --> 00:25:13.600
It's an ID.

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:17.053
Here's the ID of the pop-up.

00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:18.600
When this button is clicked,

00:25:18.986 --> 00:25:21.333
this is the element that's being controlled.

00:25:21.693 --> 00:25:25.240
If you've got a menu that's an unordered list,

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.893
area controls would tie to that
unordered list.

00:25:31.986 --> 00:25:36.080
Moving on to the dialogue itself,
when we open the dialogue,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.120
there's a lot of information in there

00:25:40.173 --> 00:25:45.693
that we would like the screen reader
to assist us with.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.226
One is this dialogue needs a label.

00:25:50.293 --> 00:25:54.453
The label that we've attached is Contact Us.

00:25:55.586 --> 00:26:00.040
I have added it as an H2 element down here
and called it title.

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:05.546
I use the ACF field that the user provided.

00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:10.573
They filled it out and said
the pop-up title is going to be Contact Us.

00:26:12.906 --> 00:26:15.240
Sure enough, when we open it up,

00:26:15.293 --> 00:26:19.226
we can see there's a H2 there
that says contact us.

00:26:20.493 --> 00:26:25.120
The ID is connected to the dialogue
using the area labeled by.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.346
Area labeled by is very similar
to area labeled,

00:26:28.373 --> 00:26:33.053
but it just means it's labeled
by another element that's on the page.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:42.080
Whenever you open this item,
go and refer to the other element

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:45.040
and inform the user what it is
that is happening here.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.986
Within this display block, when we call it,

00:26:51.053 --> 00:26:55.426
one of the things that I mentioned
earlier is that this is preview

00:26:55.493 --> 00:26:59.000
is passed in to say if we're in the editor
or if we're on the front end.

00:26:59.906 --> 00:27:04.160
What I'm doing in this block is
if we're in the editor,

00:27:04.253 --> 00:27:10.226
then I set open to true on this thing
so that it's already open

00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:11.520
and we can add stuff in it.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.106
When I first built the block
and I didn't have that,

00:27:14.573 --> 00:27:18.506
I didn't have a dialogue visible because
I would have to click the Contact Us button.

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:21.093
Since I didn't enqueue the JavaScript
on the back end,

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.280
and I don't want to have
my JavaScript enqueued on the back end,

00:27:25.586 --> 00:27:27.426
I wasn't able to get in there.

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:32.853
Having access to this is preview
gives us the ability to present

00:27:33.013 --> 00:27:38.160
a different view of our block in the editor
than we're going to get on the front end.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.080
The block contains a close button,

00:27:43.346 --> 00:27:46.626
and we all know it's a close button
because it has a big black X in it,

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:48.620
and we're all used to seeing that.

00:27:48.973 --> 00:27:50.920
However, if you're using a screen reader,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.026
the black X is actually an SVG that is just
a bunch of polygons and points and whatnot.

00:27:57.573 --> 00:28:00.493
I've actually set area hidden on that

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:04.226
just so that the screen readers
don't even bother pushing down into that.

00:28:05.013 --> 00:28:08.120
What that means is this button has no content.

00:28:08.506 --> 00:28:12.773
A button with no content needs
a label in order

00:28:12.813 --> 00:28:16.600
for the screen readers to understand
what that button is.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.413
When this button is focused,
it should be announced as close pop-up

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.866
because of the area label
that I've attached there.

00:28:28.986 --> 00:28:35.013
A feature of using the dialog element in HTML,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:41.186
going back to our semantic HTML,
dialogs bring a lot of luxuries

00:28:41.226 --> 00:28:45.973
with them that helps us avoid having to write
our own JavaScript code.

00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:49.000
One of the things
that we can do within the dialog

00:28:49.066 --> 00:28:53.080
is add the autofocus property to an element.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.280
Whenever the dialog pops up,

00:28:55.613 --> 00:28:58.093
then that element will receive focus.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.586
In this case, when the pop-up opens,

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:09.133
you'll see that it automatically focuses
on the close button.

00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:11.906
When I close it, the dialog,

00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:16.106
because the browser knows what a dialog is
and it knows what button you click to open it,

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:19.106
it's going to automatically focus us
back onto the button

00:29:19.293 --> 00:29:22.546
that we use to open the element with.

00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:25.160
It saves us a whole ton of work.

00:29:25.493 --> 00:29:29.440
I originally wrote this presentation using
a div for dialog

00:29:29.546 --> 00:29:33.586
because I wasn't aware that dialog existed
until somebody pointed out,

00:29:33.746 --> 00:29:35.693
why don't you just use the dialog element?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.946
I looked at it.

00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:44.186
I stripped out about two-thirds
of my JavaScript

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.746
that was handling focus
and keyboard presses and whatnot

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.053
and ended up
with a much simpler implementation

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.386
that made it much easier to build and to use.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.253
Real quick, jumping down to the bottom,

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.900
I want to just point out
this inner blocks down here is

00:30:05.933 --> 00:30:09.826
a specific feature of Gutenberg
that allows us,

00:30:10.253 --> 00:30:11.986
wherever we put the inner blocks,

00:30:12.026 --> 00:30:16.626
that's where the Gutenberg block content
is going to show up for us

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.786
when we render this block.

00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:21.506
These are all of our children blocks.

00:30:21.546 --> 00:30:23.760
The form itself in this paragraph

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.533
and other things are going to be stuffed
into this inner blocks

00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:33.613
when Gutenberg walks down the hierarchy
of blocks that it's rendering.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:36.853
All right.

00:30:36.893 --> 00:30:40.800
That was a lot of information in this
and we're moving along quickly.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.560
Let's see.

00:30:43.786 --> 00:30:47.626
There's the render callback
that we registered in our block.json.

00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:50.893
All it does is false that display block.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.426
ACF wants to see a single file.

00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:58.826
That is the callback. I didn't want to pass
the whole class in here

00:30:58.853 --> 00:31:02.253
because it made things more complex.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.733
All I do is call that display block.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.453
JavaScript code that comes with it.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.186
Really very simple because,

00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:14.893
again, the dialogue element is doing most
of the work for us.

00:31:15.253 --> 00:31:21.240
We have down at the bottom a couple
of quick event listeners,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.413
one that opens our pop-up, one that closes it.

00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:27.053
We're allowing multiple pop-ups on the page

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.493
so we can loop through all the ones that
we find and add that listener to it.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.400
What does it mean to open the pop-up?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.173
Well, we're going to use that attribute
that we set earlier

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.333
to find out what does this button control,

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:46.560
find that element that's being controlled,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.546
and then use the show modal function,
which is built into the browser.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.786
It is part of the dialogue element.

00:31:56.573 --> 00:31:58.893
You can either use show or showModal.

00:31:58.973 --> 00:32:03.893
If you use showModal,
it traps focus within that box

00:32:04.026 --> 00:32:08.333
and makes you graze out the back of the screen.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.546
We're opening it up.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.173
We're going to manage our state
by setting the area expanded to true

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.893
so that the screen readers know
that now this element

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.093
that we said was closed earlier is now open.

00:32:25.586 --> 00:32:32.493
I'm going to real quick just add
a HasModalOpen class to the HTML element

00:32:32.773 --> 00:32:39.080
so that WordPress has defined this as
a standard HasModalOpen

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.560
whenever they open a modal.

00:32:40.853 --> 00:32:43.866
It prevents scrolling
of the page underneath.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.613
Without it, you can open the modal
but still scroll the page.

00:32:48.653 --> 00:32:49.293
I don't want it.

00:32:50.066 --> 00:32:52.066
It seems like bad behavior to me.

00:32:53.266 --> 00:32:57.280
Closing the pop-up is just doing pretty much

00:32:57.493 --> 00:33:00.240
the opposite of what we did when we opened it.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.680
When you click the close button,

00:33:03.693 --> 00:33:08.160
it's going to find the pop-up
that the close button lives within.

00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:13.613
It's going to call the browser's
close function for the dialogue.

00:33:14.733 --> 00:33:21.400
Then it is going to figure out
what button is used to open that,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.973
go find that button,
and change area expanded to false.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.373
Then it's going to remove the HasModalOpen.

00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:32.520
If I open the inspector on this,

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.826
here's the button.

00:33:35.986 --> 00:33:39.560
You'll see when I click on it, the states change.

00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:41.920
You can see area expanded goes to true.

00:33:43.573 --> 00:33:49.066
The dialogue element itself gets
the open attribute that

00:33:49.466 --> 00:33:52.133
the browser's handling that for me.

00:33:52.933 --> 00:33:54.253
I didn't do that.

00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:55.693
Our code doesn't do that.

00:33:55.733 --> 00:33:58.453
We just call the show modal
and this thing pops up.

00:33:58.666 --> 00:34:00.306
Then when I click the close,

00:34:01.613 --> 00:34:06.320
you can see the open attribute dropped off
here and area expanded went to false.

00:34:09.466 --> 00:34:09.986
All right.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.920
Then there's some CSS that controls this.

00:34:12.973 --> 00:34:15.600
I'm not going to dive into the CSS very much

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.106
other than a best practice that I use

00:34:20.426 --> 00:34:24.626
when I can is to use those area attributes

00:34:24.853 --> 00:34:29.320
to control the visibility
and the stylings of things.

00:34:29.786 --> 00:34:32.306
That gives me a quick feedback.

00:34:32.386 --> 00:34:37.440
If my area is not working correctly

00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:41.933
and my area expanded true
doesn't get set on something,

00:34:42.053 --> 00:34:43.520
it won't actually appear.

00:34:43.613 --> 00:34:48.106
I'll know it's broken without even
having to open up a screen reader

00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:49.773
or do anything else to test that.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.986
All right.

00:34:54.586 --> 00:34:55.746
That's the code.

00:34:56.746 --> 00:34:58.413
Everybody has access to that.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.826
Feel free to use that. Try it out.

00:35:00.906 --> 00:35:02.626
Test it in your own environments.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.453
How do we make sure that it's working?

00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:13.146
Here at CodeGeek, we have various stages
of our development.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.853
We do different things.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:22.440
There's automated conformance checkers
that we use that will run a test on the site.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:30.960
It tells us about things like
bad color contrast or missing tags.

00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:35.093
It tells us if our buttons are too small,
the target areas.

00:35:35.213 --> 00:35:37.040
There's a lot of things that get checked there.

00:35:39.066 --> 00:35:42.800
We do keyboard testing
and then we do screen reader testing.

00:35:43.013 --> 00:35:47.600
Both of those are manual and require
a real person sitting down

00:35:47.653 --> 00:35:50.920
and actually trying to use the site.

00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:56.880
For automatic conformance checking,
Lighthouse is a really good one.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.253
I assume most people have at least been
somewhat exposed to Lighthouse by now,

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.480
but I usually run it in a incognito window.

00:36:09.826 --> 00:36:13.080
You can open up the inspector,
go to the Lighthouse tab.

00:36:13.426 --> 00:36:16.373
There's an accessibility checkbox here.

00:36:16.773 --> 00:36:21.453
It takes 15 seconds,
30 seconds to analyze a single page,

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.293
and gives you instant feedback on,
am I doing a good job?

00:36:29.106 --> 00:36:34.546
Something I like about Lighthouse
is not only does it tell you what it tested,

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:37.106
it tells you the things that it didn't test

00:36:37.186 --> 00:36:41.520
and stuff that you as the developer
of this page or this block

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.986
now need to go through and make sure that

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.960
your interactive controls are keyboard
focusable.

00:36:47.493 --> 00:36:49.346
We'll do that in just a moment.

00:36:49.706 --> 00:36:53.733
That your elements indicate their purpose
and state

00:36:53.786 --> 00:36:57.960
and all these other things
that are not easily checked

00:36:58.053 --> 00:36:59.306
by an automated checker.

00:37:01.413 --> 00:37:03.520
We'll dive into that in a moment.

00:37:04.586 --> 00:37:05.840
When we ship our sites,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.506
I'll give a shout-out here to Equalize Digital.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.586
They have an excellent product
that we use on many of our sites

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:14.653
that do continuous monitoring

00:37:15.626 --> 00:37:20.613
and keep track
of our accessibility audits over time

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.240
so we can see how things have progressed

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.146
and whether content that has been added
this month has broken things.

00:37:31.386 --> 00:37:31.853
Let's see,

00:37:31.893 --> 00:37:40.733
I personally use Pa11y CI continuous
integration tool that I found on NPM.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.800
It's a great package that,
in my development environment,

00:37:45.853 --> 00:37:49.440
I've created some scripting that will go
and run this tool

00:37:49.493 --> 00:37:53.280
and it will step through the entire site,
all the pages on my site,

00:37:53.586 --> 00:37:56.906
and every time I make a change locally,
I can run this test.

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:05.093
I ran it shortly earlier
and it provides an HTML output.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.933
I made a change to get rid of the area label
on my button and it immediately found it.

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:14.480
I was happy that it actually worked
and if I click into that,

00:38:14.546 --> 00:38:16.013
it tells me what the issue is,

00:38:16.346 --> 00:38:21.720
identifies the item that was the cause
of the problem,

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:28.080
and lets me find issues that are
site-wide very, very quickly and easily.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.693
That's available on NPM.

00:38:31.773 --> 00:38:35.093
There's a download link here
that gives more information.

00:38:35.493 --> 00:38:37.506
I'm not personally responsible
for writing that,

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.786
but I find it very useful.

00:38:39.906 --> 00:38:42.733
Keyboard testing,
we've done a little bit of that,

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.226
but there is no substitute
for keyboard testing.

00:38:49.053 --> 00:38:53.093
You just need to get in there
and start hitting tabs

00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:56.173
and arrows and whatever else.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.773
On this particular page,

00:39:00.573 --> 00:39:03.506
you should always start out
on the skip to main content.

00:39:05.466 --> 00:39:07.093
That's the first sign that

00:39:07.466 --> 00:39:10.600
somebody has put some effort
into making something accessible.

00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:13.560
When you're in a menu system,

00:39:13.813 --> 00:39:21.026
you should be able to hit either enter
or space on a button to toggle that.

00:39:21.653 --> 00:39:25.826
If you're in a menu, hopefully,
the arrow keys work,

00:39:25.853 --> 00:39:27.653
so I'm hitting arrows left and right.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.346
Space bar toggles a button.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.240
I can hit tab. This is a modal.

00:39:35.346 --> 00:39:40.920
Interestingly enough, when I'm within a modal,
dialog modal on Chrome,

00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:45.946
one of the things that happens is
it does actually trap focus

00:39:45.973 --> 00:39:48.733
within the page when you're in the page,
but if you keep tapping,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.866
you go out of the page and into all
of the Chrome stuff up at the top,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.266
and then when you jump back
into the page again,

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.333
you end up back into the modal.

00:40:00.413 --> 00:40:01.733
Just a weirdness of Chrome.

00:40:03.306 --> 00:40:04.080
Let's see.

00:40:04.173 --> 00:40:09.760
For testing our button, we want to make sure
that we can hit the space bar to open it.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.200
Notice that the close button is focused.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.906
I can hit the enter button there.

00:40:17.026 --> 00:40:20.506
When it's open,
I should be able to hit the escape key.

00:40:20.693 --> 00:40:22.013
That should close it again.

00:40:23.186 --> 00:40:26.426
There is an excellent resource
that I've linked

00:40:28.173 --> 00:40:32.440
that shows you what to expect
for every element

00:40:32.506 --> 00:40:35.813
when you're stepping through
keyboard navigation on a page.

00:40:38.946 --> 00:40:40.333
I go to this all the time.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.400
I'm going to select.

00:40:41.466 --> 00:40:42.600
What should I select to do?

00:40:42.666 --> 00:40:45.586
Well, I look down here
and say I should be able to use the arrow keys,

00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:49.680
the space bar,
and enter and escape to select things.

00:40:52.253 --> 00:40:54.000
Jessica: You were on the WebAIM.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.546
Kevin: Actually, screen reader testing.
Oh, we are out of time, aren't we?

00:40:57.653 --> 00:41:02.453
Jessica: Yes, but you were just
on the WebAIM tutorial

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.653
to teach us about the keyboard testing.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.893
Can you read us out that URL?

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.210
Because we can't read it.

00:41:09.253 --> 00:41:11.533
Kevin: Oh, okay.

00:41:11.546 --> 00:41:23.306
It is
webaim.org/techniques/keyboard#testing.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.960
Jessica: Super actionable.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.146
Kevin: Yes, it really is. I go here all the time.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.520
If you're doing keyboard testing.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.640
Screen reader testing,
hopefully one of these other sessions

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.826
that people are doing will
show screen reader testing.

00:41:42.173 --> 00:41:46.146
I just want to leave everybody with,
use semantic HTML where possible,

00:41:46.266 --> 00:41:47.946
add ARIA as needed.

00:41:51.493 --> 00:41:57.360
I listed the uses for JavaScript here
and some great resources.

00:41:58.573 --> 00:41:59.946
Jessica: We love a good resource.

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:01.960
Kevin: A lot of good resources.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.600
I have all of these bookmarked,

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.120
and I just went through all my bookmarks
and copied them in.

00:42:07.573 --> 00:42:08.960
Open to questions.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.213
Jessica: I did get some questions.

00:42:11.253 --> 00:42:14.173
I'll be the one to read them aloud to you
for our recording.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.946
First, I want to end on a note of gratitude

00:42:16.986 --> 00:42:19.866
because you got some kudos
while you were talking.

00:42:21.586 --> 00:42:25.440
You have one that says,
"Outstanding session. Thanks, Kevin."

00:42:25.706 --> 00:42:26.866
You have one that says,

00:42:26.906 --> 00:42:30.986
"I finally understand the use of inner blocks.
Thanks, Kevin."

00:42:35.506 --> 00:42:41.840
Me, thank you so much for making such a clear
and actionable demo,

00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:44.586
and you covered a lot in such a short time.

00:42:45.773 --> 00:42:51.386
I'm going to go to our questions that came
into the Q&amp;A panel.

00:42:51.413 --> 00:42:56.826
We have about 10 minutes to go over those,
and at 10 till the top of the hour,

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.293
we're going to take a break.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.800
That's how much time we have left.
I'll go into the first one.

00:43:02.866 --> 00:43:05.760
Based on third-party audits I've reviewed,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.146
it is not uncommon
for some accessibility testing

00:43:10.173 --> 00:43:15.173
and reporting services
to argue modal headings should be an H1

00:43:15.706 --> 00:43:19.266
because it's an independent entity.
What's your response to that?

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.640
Kevin: I can believe it.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:33.546
I struggle with naming things what they are,
and that's a common issue I have.

00:43:33.786 --> 00:43:37.013
Once I know what it is, I know how to deal with it.

00:43:37.613 --> 00:43:40.200
Should a modal heading be in H1?

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.706
I wish I was a native user
of screen-reader technologies

00:43:48.733 --> 00:43:57.200
so I could experience the site the way people
who use those on a daily basis do.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.333
For me, I'm leery about adding an H1 there

00:44:03.373 --> 00:44:13.893
because I don't want it to show up as
a really major topic in the landmarks.

00:44:14.106 --> 00:44:16.880
This is not equivalent to the page itself,

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.520
but at the same time, it's really its own entity.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.600
We're taking you off the page into this pop-up.

00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:25.760
I can see it go either way.

00:44:25.986 --> 00:44:34.786
If H1 is the approved mechanism for that,
I can certainly understand it,

00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:38.626
and it's an easy adjustment in the HTML.

00:44:39.133 --> 00:44:43.133
Jessica: Isn't there a semantic heading
for what's in the title bar,

00:44:43.173 --> 00:44:46.066
but then you can have an H1
in the content of the modal?

00:44:47.346 --> 00:44:52.066
Kevin: Right. In my modal itself,
I used the area labeled by,

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:59.026
and I used an H2 because I didn't want it
to compete with the H1 on the page.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.000
I put an H2 in there, and I could have used an H1,

00:45:02.106 --> 00:45:09.173
and I can be convinced if somebody says
that's the right way to do it,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.653
I will certainly switch.

00:45:12.733 --> 00:45:15.040
Jessica: Our next question, it's a long one.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.560
I'm going to read it for the record.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.866
In your extensive WP experience,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.146
how would you suggest building
a WCAG conformant website

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.306
with low to medium complexity
for a low to medium-budget customer,

00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:31.960
for example, non-profit with WordPress?

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.733
Do you absolutely need

00:45:33.773 --> 00:45:37.813
a custom theme to be sure all components
are programmatically conformant,

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.866
such as role, label, state,

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.173
more so than the accessible
front-end CSS choices?

00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:47.080
Trying to explore
what can leverage out of the box

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.586
from WordPress to cut down on dev costs
for this demographic of clients

00:45:51.613 --> 00:45:54.706
that need an intuitive enough web builder,

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.480
but can't afford custom websites,
but the resulting WordPress website

00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:02.520
absolutely needs to have the potential
to be WCAG conformant.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.946
Kevin: Good question.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:15.386
About two years ago, here at CodeGeek,
we went through an investigation of,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.653
we're going to build it,
or we need a theme that is accessible,

00:46:20.693 --> 00:46:23.226
or as accessible as it can be.

00:46:26.386 --> 00:46:30.746
At the time, WordPress was coming out
with the new full-site editing,

00:46:30.773 --> 00:46:35.250
we wanted to embrace that,
and move forward with WordPress.

00:46:36.213 --> 00:46:40.453
What we ended up with is,
we looked at several themes,

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.226
we found one that was somewhat accessible,

00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:46.733
but it didn't provide all the features
that we were looking for.

00:46:47.733 --> 00:46:50.813
If you're looking for an off-the-shelf theme,

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.920
we looked at a theme called JACE.

00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:59.280
I don't know if it's still available,
but I think it's J-A-C-E.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.226
Then we ended up building our own,

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.866
rolling our own theme that we now use
for all of our accessible clients.

00:47:09.986 --> 00:47:11.973
You do it once, you invest the effort.

00:47:12.226 --> 00:47:17.506
We've recently rolled out our brand new
accessible navigation,

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.933
because we've been fighting with
native WordPress navigation for a long time,

00:47:22.146 --> 00:47:25.253
where it, out of the box, was not accessible.

00:47:25.706 --> 00:47:28.760
Then they've started
to add accessibility features,

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:30.600
but we've already added the features,

00:47:30.653 --> 00:47:32.933
and then we've started clashing with them.

00:47:33.973 --> 00:47:38.000
It looks like WordPress is moving
towards more accessible navigation,

00:47:38.093 --> 00:47:43.880
but we've ended up with our own plugin
that we use for building navigations now,

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.026
that we hope to be as accessible as possible,
and we have control over that,

00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:52.386
so we can modify it as we move forward.

00:47:53.293 --> 00:47:57.200
The hope is we will leverage
the investment that we made in that theme

00:47:57.253 --> 00:48:03.066
and that plugin, and use it for many,
many clients over and over again,

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.600
in order to keep the costs down.

00:48:05.973 --> 00:48:15.720
Rolling out a custom theme for a single site
is probably not cost-effective.

00:48:17.146 --> 00:48:20.560
Jessica: Follow-up question
from another audience member.

00:48:20.653 --> 00:48:27.600
Is Kevin willing to let other people
use his base theme, wink emoji?

00:48:27.746 --> 00:48:33.853
Kevin: Oh, I would have to check
with my team on that and see.

00:48:34.866 --> 00:48:41.893
We invested a lot of hours into it,

00:48:47.373 --> 00:48:48.920
so I'll check with the team.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.720
Jessica: Bring them on as new customers.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.560
Kevin: I don't know, are there more questions?

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.733
Jessica: No, comments.

00:49:02.746 --> 00:49:05.000
Kevin: If not, I can give a plug for Cogi.

00:49:05.053 --> 00:49:06.880
We do a lot of accessibility work.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:11.026
There's a link at the bottom of the slide deck

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.933
that takes you to our accessibility page,

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:18.306
and you can see some of the products
and services that we offer there.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.826
If you need help achieving
your accessibility goals

00:49:22.946 --> 00:49:29.080
and want access to some of the work
that we've done, check us out.

00:49:29.906 --> 00:49:31.653
Jessica: That is smooth.

00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:32.560
Kevin: Shameless plug.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.586
Jessica: I'm happy that you told me
that there was a dialogue element

00:49:36.626 --> 00:49:39.320
because I'm not in the weeds that deep
with the code to know

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.026
every single semantic tag, so thanks for that.

00:49:43.746 --> 00:49:45.880
I'll do our transition.

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:49.106
Thanks for attending this session.

00:49:51.533 --> 00:49:53.973
Thanks for attending the session
with Kevin Sholander

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.226
on accessible Gutenberg blocks.

00:49:56.253 --> 00:49:59.800
You can continue the conversation
with the chat

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:06.373
or on social media
using the hashtag WPA11yDay

00:50:06.853 --> 00:50:12.080
and hashtag WPAD2024.

00:50:12.893 --> 00:50:16.400
We'd appreciate it if you go to W--

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:24.026
No, the address is

00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:35.293
Stay tuned for our next session coming up.

00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:41.026
The next session coming up
is Navigating Neurodiversity,

00:50:41.266 --> 00:50:45.520
Creating Websites with Inclusivity in Mind
with Christina Workman.

00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:49.720
