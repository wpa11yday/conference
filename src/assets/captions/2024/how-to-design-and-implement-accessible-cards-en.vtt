<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.000
How to Design and Implement
Accessible Cards with Speaker Tina Reis,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.870
WordPress Developer and SEO
Consultant at Tina Reis Webentwicklung.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.780
This presentation was recorded
October 2024.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Sherose Badruddin> Welcome everyone
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.520
If you're in the Eastern Time Zone
like me, it's morning, so good morning.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.440
I'm Sherose Badruddin.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.890
I work at the University
of North Carolina.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm a digital accessibility consultant,
and I'm so grateful to be here.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.300
I did want to make a note to announce
that Melissa Spiegel,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.040
who was scheduled to be here today,
was unable to attend.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.840
She's in Florida dealing with the fallout
from Hurricane Milton,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.640
and we're grateful for her for trying to
volunteer, and we're especially grateful

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.620
for Tina Reis, who is here and able
to join us today for their session,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.820
How to Design and Implement
Accessible Cards.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.480
A bit about Tina.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.720
Tina is a SEO consultant
and WordPress developer,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.260
specializing in web
accessibility based in Berlin, Germany.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.970
They started out developing
SEO strategies for websites,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.500
large and small, from e-commerce
to non-profit sites.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.040
Later,
they discovered their love for WordPress

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.970
when working at an agency
and taught themselves the skills

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940
of front-end development,
learning more with every project.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.750
Now with eight-plus years of experience,
Tina owns their own business

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750
and develops WordPress sites with a focus
on accessibility and sustainability.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.190
They also give workshops
and help organizations

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.350
increase their online visibility
with SEO.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.460
Please feel free
all to add your questions in the Zoom

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.460
Q&amp;A section, and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.200
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.040
Tina, you can take it away.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Tina Reis> Thank you so much.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.880
Yes, I'm going to share my screen.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.310
Hello, I'm going to talk about
how to design

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.640
and implement Accessible Cards today.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.590
First of all, I also want to say that
I hope everybody

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.360
who is affected by the hurricane
in Florida is safe.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.350
Maybe I already had a good introduction,
thank you so much.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.930
Maybe just one thing that I want to say
is that I have a disability myself.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.440
I have ADHD and I have a motor disability

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.610
that is so far only affecting my legs.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.880
My access needs when it comes
to the Internet,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.220
I'm mostly not affected very much,
which is good.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.450
I just want to say this
because everything that I'm going to talk

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.020
about here is mostly what I've learned,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.130
not from my own experience,
but what I've learned.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.200
I'm also going to link
to some really good resources

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.870
from people
who have written about this topic before.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.600
First of all, I want to start

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.710
just by asking a very simple question,
what is a card?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.280
I looked at one of my favorite components
libraries, Cody House.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.720
Here in the slide

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.220
that I'm showing right now,
you can see their gallery of components

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.490
and I've selected in this menu
that they have

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.630
that filters the gallery,
I've selected card

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.460
and it shows 23 items.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.640
They're all very different
from each other.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.800
You have something like a video gallery
that is labeled as cards.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.840
There's parts
that are like a slider type of component

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400
and then there's the classic,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.820
I think image with text on the button.
Those are all cards.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.220
I think when we think about it,
what those all have in common,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.570
then we can say cards

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.510
are usually interactive.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.460
Here I have a little example card

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.670
that I'm going to be using
throughout this talk.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.740
It's just a very simple interactive,
like a card with an image.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.240
Here I'm having the image
of a little bird.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.750
You'll see
lots of birds in this presentation.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.480
Then there's a title,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.450
how to get started with bird watching,
just a very non-descript,

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.460
little description text underneath,
and then a button to read more.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.490
I think in this simple example,
but like all cards,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.300
no matter what they do,
is that cards are interactive.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.700
Here, this card wants you to click it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.020
and go to the article, and read it.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.910
The other thing that cards
usually have in common

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.620
is that they are one of many.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.450
You use the card component to show

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.350
an overview of different elements
on your website.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.290
Here, a very simple example, again,
just a block overview.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.660
Each card leads to a blog article.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.200
I'm going to be working with
this simple example in this presentation.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.110
Here in the image,
I just have the same card example

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.310
that I just mentioned
with an image, a title,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.550
a little description,
and a read more button,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.170
and six of them in a grid.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.720
Now, what I want to do today,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.190
I think that the card
is a really interesting example

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.890
from an accessibility perspective

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.700
because you can--
It looks so simple, but it actually has

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.400
a lot of considerations, that
a lot of ways you can think about this

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.770
for accessibility.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.570
I want to focus today on accessibility

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.940
beyond compliance, so beyond WCAG

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.350
with the focus on usability.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.970
How can you really get
the most out of the component from

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.590
a usability perspective?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.130
Because I think
there's really getting compliant

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.330
with this is much easier
than making it actually usable.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.170
With all of that,
I'm not reinventing the wheel here.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.040
These are some really great resources,
where I have learned all these techniques

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.080
of knowledge over the years
developing WordPress websites.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.850
I just want to name a few of them.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.850
One of them is Heydon Pickering,
who has these

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.260
great inclusive components library

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.060
and it also has a card component,
which is great.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.860
Then there are also really good
takes on accessible cards

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.970
by Adrian Roselli and Kitty Giraudel,
who is also in Berlin.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.370
If you get the slides afterwards,
there will be the link

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.260
also in the slide.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.410
I've learned these techniques

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.680
over the years
and what I'm going to show you

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.950
is specifically how to do this
with WordPress.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.200
All the code examples that I'm going to
show are my code examples

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.400
from myWordPress project.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.560
Also,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.220
we're going to do
more of a trial-and-error approach.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.360
We're going to walk you
through each of the considerations

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.660
and we're not going to start
with a finished result

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.470
that I'm just going to explain to you,
but we're going to work on

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.750
creating a finished result
during this talk.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.540
Let's get started.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.710
First, what are the considerations?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.980
You want it to have the card
to have a logical structure.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.350
This is especially important for screen
reader users, for example,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.950
where all the information needs to be
in the semantic structure.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.820
You want to have
a specific visual layout.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.920
Also, I'm a developer.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.490
I get designs from a designer
and so I have some-

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.260
I have a specific visual layout that
I need to achieve.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.300
Then also I want to ensure
that it is interactive

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.220
because that's the core
requirement for a card.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.780
Then I have--
Let's tackle the first thing first.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.750
The having multiple parts in a row.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:12.190
Here I'm showing, again, my little grid
with the preview with the cards,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.260
six cards in the grid.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.330
Now I'm going to show the bad
example first.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.100
If you mark this up with just divs,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.440
here on the left side,
I have an example, HTML markup,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.740
where it's just divs as the container
and then divs for each of the cards.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.910
That doesn't give any information
about what this actually is.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.950
For example, to a screen reader.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.990
Another example that you can do,
which is a bit better,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.520
is you, for example,
use a main tag for the container.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.490
And each of the cards
are in an article tag.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.400
This is a bit better
because this gives us

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.100
some actual information
about what this is

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.970
to a screen reader.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.710
The screen reader can give the users

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.380
more information, more features.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.280
For example, with the main tag,
this would show up

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.990
if somebody uses the screen reader
and navigates through the landmarks,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.420
they could directly go
to the main content with this

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.030
but there's still a problem
with the article.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.800
Actually, not all screen readers
have this as a landmark.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.900
For, I think, only JAWS announces

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.670
it as a landmark.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.780
Still, even though you're using
a semantic HTML5 element,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.080
you're not really giving much information
to screen reader users.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.390
Now a better example,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.910
and this is best practice,
is to have it as a list markup.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.260
Here, I've shown it
as a basic HTML example

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.930
with an unnumbered list tag,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.200
and then each of the cards
in a list item.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.900
What this gives you is--
This gives a really good-

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.670
because it is a card of one of many.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.750
A list gives that information
to a screen reader user.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.440
This is the list of,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.680
and then the screen reader will announce,
six items,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.320
and there's some navigation features
that also come with that in

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.600
the screen reader.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.930
Now, I took a look at what

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.730
most WordPress themes use.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.770
Most, especially the commonly used ones,
the page builders,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.570
don't use the list markup for cards.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.970
I've actually seen more often
the article markup

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.450
and here, a shout out
to Amber Hinds of Equalize Digital,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:57.060
because she analyzed 10-page builders,
and they're only two use the list markup

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.790
for their blog or posts loop.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.160
This is definitely something
that a lot of the WordPress

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.930
themes and page builders are lacking.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.860
That's why, for example,
I work with GeneratePress,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.280
and they also have an article markup
and so I'm also often building

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.930
my own loops
with my own cards.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.350
I also want to mention kudos
to Avada and Bricks

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.730
because they were the two-page builders
that use list markup in this test.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.490
Now we've decided we're going to have
this as a list markup and here

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.330
I have a very basic HTML markup

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.030
for the item itself, for the card itself.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.430
For this simple card, just as a reminder,
it has a preview and this is the image,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.940
it has a title, it has a little
descriptive text, and a read more link.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.220
Sometimes I say button,
which is not correct

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.370
but I mean, a read more link.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.420
The basic HTML markup
that we're going to work with

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.120
is just as a list item.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.260
I've given it a class of card,

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.160
thenit has an image.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.430
Here I've kept the alternative text empty

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.770
and we're going to talk about images,
so don't you worry.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.740
Then the title I've marked up
as an h2 headline

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.170
and the description just as a paragraph

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.570
and then I have the link

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.460
at the bottom.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.490
This is generally like

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.660
sign markup
but the problem is with the link.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.430
Here, for example, only the read

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.330
more link is actually linked

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.470
but that's not usually
what you expect of a card.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:56.270
You expect it like when I'm on my phone,
I want to be able to click on the image

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.330
and it directly brings me
to the article.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.060
I think this is also what
if you're designing a card element

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.810
that's a marketing banner

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.550
that your marketing people will also want
to increase the click area.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:17.660
What I see in a lot of WordPress themes
is that they solve

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.430
this by just adding links
to all of the elements.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:28.170
For example, this is an example image

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.110
from the GeneratePress solar demo site.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.540
I'm just showing a lot of GeneratePress,
not because they are bad,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.840
just because that's the theme
that I usually work with.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.550
It's actually a really cool theme.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.550
Here you can see they have
also a basic card

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.290
that leads to a blog article

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.660
and it has also an image,
it has some categories too

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.060
and it has a title
and it has a read more link.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.060
Very similar to what we're working with
but here they've solved

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.930
this issue of increasing the click area
by adding

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.000
a link tag around

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.540
the image, around the title
and around the read more.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.310
You have three links
leading to the same destination.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.000
This is not good.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.050
What this will lead to,
like here, for example,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.220
if you're using the Wave accessibility
testing tool, this will throw errors.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.260
Here, the error,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.530
I screenshotted the error,
it says redundant link

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.400
and then a lot of icons
that show, okay, here's an error.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.870
The explanation for it is that adjacent

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.240
links go to the same destination
and that is bad practice

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.140
because it is confusing
if you're using a screen reader and also

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.380
it's just redundant.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.440
It's adding a lot of noise.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.150
are we back to just keeping the link

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.620
as the, on the read more button?

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.110
No, there's a better solution.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.630
We want to work with only one link,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.800
but have the whole card clickable

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.670
and because if we're only having it

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.040
on the read more link, what happens then

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.270
if a screen reader users
navigate the site because

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.040
by listing out all the link

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.050
elements on the page,
this is one way that screen reader users

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.920
can navigate a page by saying,
"Okay, give me all of the links,"

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.790
then what happens is
that it just says read

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.860
more, read more, read more
and it's not descriptive.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.830
This is definitely not a good solution.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.950
We can't do it like that.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.600
The best practice would be

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.640
to just ask yourself, "Okay,
what is the most important,

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.110
the most descriptive element
on this card?"

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.650
and I think that is here in this case,
it's the headline.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.820
We put the title here, I'm showing
the basic HTML markup again.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:03.820
We're putting the link tag inside
of the headline.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.460
Now we don't need the read
more button anymore.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.570
We're going to discuss this
a little bit later if that's really true

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.870
but for now,
we have now a good markup that gives

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.810
screen reader users a descriptive link,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.210
but still, we don't have
the whole area clickable.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.610
What we can do
now is we use this little trick

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.790
where we create a pseudo
element on the link

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.860
and make it span

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.640
with absolute positioning and CSS,
the whole card.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.930
That is really neat
and I love this trick.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.600
Ever since I learned it,
I use it all the time.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.000
It makes it so you only have one link
and it's around the descriptive element.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.060
That's good for screen reader users
but the whole area that is--

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.440
The whole card element
that is positioned relative,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.950
so that works if clickable.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.080
This is cool.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.280
Here I have the CSS.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.440
If you later get the slides,
you can just copy this.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.530
Then one thing, now you think like,
"Oh, I have a good solution,"

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.440
but then your designer is like,
"Hey, I want to put the author byline

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.840
in there." Here for example,
I have another one of those cards.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.980
I'm switching the images up a little bit.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.750
This is a different bird
as a preview image.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.620
Here below the headline,

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.620
we have an author byline and often

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.240
this is linked.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.260
In this case,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.630
I think Heydon Pickering
makes a really good point

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.070
because he asks, "Hey,
do you really need this to be a link?

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.670
Is it really--"
Are people going to see this in a blog

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.950
overview and be like,
"Oh, I'm going to click directly

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.410
on the author without having looked
at the article first,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.380
without having clicked through
and read the article first."

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.880
I definitely recommend--
I think this is a really good point

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.880
and I think you should think about,
do we really need the link in there?

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.190
If you said, "Yes,
we really need this link, it's important."

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.590
One thing that you can do
is that you just give

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.230
the link tag

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.110
on the author byline

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.640
that index of higher
than your pseudo-element.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.840
That is the main card link.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.270
Here, for example, the pseudo-element
that makes the whole card

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.350
clickable has a Z index of one.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.720
I want to have one of race
make also the author clickable.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.800
I'm going to raise it
with a Z index of two.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.520
Now you can see I've marked it up here.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.160
The click area is on the whole card
that leads to the whole article

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.570
but then--

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.570
I love these reactions
that you have in the room.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.240
Then the author also is clickable.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.410
Then I think now you can already see it.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.350
Click area for the author link.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.600
It's pretty small.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.780
What can happen here,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:25.360
and here I'm showing the preview image
and I've pasted a photo of my finger

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.460
and I'm putting it over the author byline
and so now you can see that

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.100
actually the author
byline is smaller than my finger.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.740
What can happen when you have these links
on top of each other,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.510
right next to each other,
it can lead to mishaps,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880
especially just with everybody,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.850
on your mobile phone and you try to click
something in a hurry,

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.750
but also, for example, for people who,
I don't know, have a tremor

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.150
and motor issues.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.060
It can be like
incredibly frustrating

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.390
if you want to click
on one thing and land somewhere else.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.800
This fortunately can be remedied.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.870
What you do is you just add padding

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.660
to the link
and then it's like, "Okay, cool."

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.880
Now you've increased it
and you can see here

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.040
I marked up the padding in green.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.180
My finger is now roughly the same size

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.780
as the click area for the author
byline, great.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.380
You can keep the same visual layout,
of course, by,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.160
I don't know, removing the margin
on the headline and shifting it around.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.750
It still looks the same,
but it has a larger padding.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.040
Then also one thing I want to say,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.280
while we're talking about myth tabs,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:47.680
here I'm showing a mobile view
of the same grid and a mobile view,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.800
all of the cards are
stacked on top of each other.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.710
Here you have my finger again,
showing that the margin between

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.330
the cards is quite--
If you keep it too small, then again,

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.510
you have a problem of myth tabs on mobile
when people are scrolling.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.060
I want to scroll

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.750
and I unexpectedly click on something

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.360
and then all hell breaks loose.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.240
I think you might think like,
"Oh, this doesn't happen to me."

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.800
orif you, for example, have motor issues,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.930
this can totally happen.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.110
What you do is you again,
increase the space

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.680
so that there'san area
between the cards,

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.710
more margin where just like now
you can see my finger fits again,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.480
where you just have this safe area

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.260
where people can scroll.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.080
Now we have
a really good solution for that.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.030
The only thing-- Oh,
I'm going to go back one.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.970
The only thing now that I've learned is
this pseudo-element is a good trick,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.240
but it makes it
so that the text is not selectable

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.140
because it's like the pseudo-element
is on top of, for example, here

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.710
the paragraph
and if somebody wants to select

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:09.550
this paragraph description
and copy it somewhere, it doesn't work.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.380
I must admit that I personally,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.280
when I just design
a blog overview, like what we have here,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.400
I usually stop here

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.950
because I think for this use case,
it's not--

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.060
You can say you disagree with this,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.230
but I think it's not super necessary
that people are able to select this

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.430
because I think that it's much more likely
that people click on the article

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.440
and after they've like,
"Oh, this is a good article."

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.740
They,I don't know, select text
and paste it or whatever,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.420
but there might be other use
cases for cards

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.380
where you do
need to have the text selectable

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.150
even though there's a whole thing.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.170
For that,
I'm not going to go through that

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.950
because as I said, this is not a technique
that I usually use,

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.400
but there is a JavaScript solution
for this

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:59.420
and there's a really great code example
in the inclusive card component

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.270
under the headline,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.100
the redundant click event
also by Heydon Pickering

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.310
and if you have a use case for this, then
I really suggest that you check that out.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.410
It is very good.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.350
For our use case,
we're going to stick with this for now.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.920
Now I want to talk about,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.820
and now this is the only time that
I'm bringing theory into this.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.020
I want to talk about affordances
because this is now

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.800
important for the next part.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.000
This is a term that comes up often.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.360
I'm studying

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.630
for a certification right now
and this is a concept that comes up often

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.740
and it says-- It's defined
as a design affordance is a clue

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.910
about how an object should be used,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.240
typically provided by the object itself
or its context.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:54.080
This is a quote by Sheri

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.150
Byrne-Haber,
who is an accessibility specialist.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.220
Link is also in the slide.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.900
Basically what that means
is that you see a thing

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.560
and you intuitively know
what to do with the thing

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.470
and this is really important for something
that is supposed to be interactive.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.200
People have to know what to do with it.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.950
I think in our example,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.950
it's quite clear,
it's a blog article

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.350
and people should be able to click on it

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.000
and they should know I can click on it.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.310
It is the most important
affordance for cards

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.390
is probably that you can interact
with them and as I said, in this case,

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.370
to click on it, to read more.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.220
Does that mean now that we have
to bring back the Read More link?

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.110
Yes, I think so because
just by adding this back in,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.740
even though we don't need it

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:56.810
anymore as a link, where we have a clear--
A very, very clear signal,

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.800
this is what happens when you click on
this and you're supposed to click on this.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.390
I think this is a good thing
for accessibility but of course,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.520
because we don't need it as a link,
we don't add it back in as a link.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.090
We just add it back in as a declaration.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.560
How you can do it is

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.060
that you just add a spam

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.770
tag for the read more

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.710
and you mark it up visually
however you like it,

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.270
however your design system

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.000
wants the link to look like.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.450
It doesn't matter
that it's not actually a link

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:38.020
because the whole card is clickable
and so you can just click on it.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.910
We don't want to give this

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.730
also to a screen reader user
because for them

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.020
it's confusing that
it's decorative as a link.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.240
It's for people who can see the card

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.680
because when you're using a screen reader,
the screen reader announces

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.000
this is a link.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.920
We use a little bit of ARIA here

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.290
with an ARIA hidden value
of true on the span element.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.620
We take it out.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:18.260
Now, this is a good solution for screen
reader users who can't see the card

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.870
but there's also sighted

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.500
screen reader users,
so people who use a screen reader

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.340
for a variety of reasons
because they have low vision or it

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.970
helps them
digest information, for example.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.580
Then for them, it's a bit confusing
that there is something

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.080
that looks like a link.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.080
It looks like something
you can interact with,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.930
but it's not read aloud.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.060
This can be confusing.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.990
Then to remedy this,

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.600
there's another trick we can use.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.200
We can still keep it as ARIA hidden,

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.670
but we give it an ID

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.810
and then we link

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.580
that ID to the actual link, reconnect it

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.750
with ARIA described by.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.820
That means on the link tag,
you have an ARIA described by

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.350
and then the ID of your readmore span.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.390
What this does is
it doesn't look any different visually

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.360
but what it does is that it makes it
so the read-more is announced

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.570
when a screen reader like reads the link.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.940
It would say link to link--

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.440
I'm really bad-- I don't know--
I don't have it memorized so which screen

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.410
reader would read it out
but it would basically be link rare birds

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.120
to see that is the headline
and then read more

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.720
because the description ARIA described by
is always read out last.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.890
This is really good in this use case.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.530
That is something
where we can make it more accessible

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.130
for all screen reader users.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.640
Then let's see what else we can do.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.970
Oh, yes,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.710
sorry, I forgot what the next slide was.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.050
Then in WordPress,
you're working in WordPress

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.110
and so you're probably
writing a loop for this

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.720
and then you're not hard
coding all the IDs.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.060
What you need is
to have a unique ID that is

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.970
automatically generated by your code.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.500
One way how I do it in PHP

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.970
is that I use the headline,
the title of the article

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.180
that we're linking to here as the basis

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.720
how I generate the ID because I assume

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.090
that those titles will always be unique.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.160
I just hope that the editors work
like that.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.230
That they don't create
a lot of blog articles with the exact same

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.880
headline title.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.970
I turn the headline into the title
of the article into an ID

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.800
with this nifty little PHP,

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.410
who is excited that we're seeing PHP here.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.680
I'm just going to explain it real quick,
but it's probably better

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.610
if you get the slides and copy it.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.480
Basically, we have a variable, the title

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.290
that we just get with get the title
and now we have the title of the article.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.030
Then we need to turn that article
because it has spaces

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.560
and maybe some funky symbols
in there or whatever

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.100
and we can't have that as the ID.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.080
We need to turn it into something
that can actually work as an ID.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.400
I'm using a delimiter as a--

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.010
What I want to use as a separator
between the words.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.010
Just like a dash, a URL kind of.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.550
Then I generate the ID

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:05.020
with basically a lot of PHP replacements

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.620
and turning it into lower case

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.230
then replacing all of

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.530
the spaces and all of that
and with the delimiter, et cetera

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.020
just copy the code.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.400
Then I can use it in my template.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.880
I can just echo
the ID in the span for the read more link

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.050
and then I have a unique
ID in WordPress, which is really cool.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.720
Now we have it in a pretty good state,

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.620
but there's still a lot of-
some things that we can do to improve it.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.860
What I want to talk about now
is keyboard navigation.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.400
People who use the keyboard
and how that experience would be for them.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.530
If you tap to this card now,

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:58.930
the keyboard focus goes
to the actual link.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.880
Here, I'm showing the card

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.350
with a visual keyboard

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.850
focus of a dotted line
around the headline.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.060
This is fine,

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.400
but it doesn't really represent

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.970
that you can interact with the whole card.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.800
It's also confusing
why doesn't it go to the read more

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.310
because it looks like a link.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.010
What we want

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.410
is to have the visual focus
around the whole card.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.250
Here in this example, I put it around
the dotted line around the whole card

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.180
and actually how we do it
is that we remove

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.750
in CSS the outline on the link tag.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.930
One of the very few cases

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.260
where you can do this
because we're removing it there,

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.800
but we're adding it to the pseudo-element

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.220
when the link gets focused.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.300
This way, when somebody taps to the card,

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.170
the whole card gets the focus.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.730
That's how I do it in my project.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.720
Then also what you might want to add is

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.420
you want to add also a type
of hover effect.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.360
Usually, I have a hover effect

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.570
that I show

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.700
when somebody hovers
with their mouth above the card

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.770
but then also I add the hover effect
to the focus,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.220
to the focus style.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.870
Here, for example,

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.810
I'm giving the span
that has our decorative

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:45.050
read more link, I'm giving it
a different background color.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.590
For the hover effect,
you can use a different hover effect.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.240
You can creativity.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.040
Let's see.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.000
Now we're going to talk about the images.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:05.860
I hope maybe some of you
have been waiting for this.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.110
The question with images is always do
they convey important information

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.180
that a screen reader user should have

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.650
or are they decorative?

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.260
If they contain informative information
that they should have

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.640
a descriptive alt text,
alternative text.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.990
If not, then you can mark

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.490
the images as decorative with an empty
alt text.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.060
In this case,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.130
I know that there's a debate also on
when is an image decorative or not.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:41.640
I must say that with cards,
I err on the side

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.310
on wanting to give screen reader users

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.810
the same type of efficiency

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.810
that I as a sighted person have.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.200
For example, here, it's a blog article

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.390
and I'm pretty sure
that when I select images for blog

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.990
articles, I'm not looking

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.760
"Oh-- In many cases, I'm not looking." Oh,

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.390
do I want to specifically show
this specific image of the bird?

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:10.670
No, I just want to have a bird
or an article about birds."

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.530
It doesn't really matter that it

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.470
is this particular photo
and I think for efficiency

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:20.080
so that screen reader users
don't have to read, listen to all of that,

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.310
I would leave the alternative tag empty

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.050
but I think there are use cases
where you definitely have

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.050
an informative image in a card

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.120
that actually determines
if a user wants to click on this.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.430
For example, here,

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.300
I'm showing more of an e-commerce use case

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.870
where the cards are not for a blog,
but for products.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.150
Each card has a product

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.370
and so here
I have three cards next to each other.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.740
Instead of a read more link,
we now have a buy link or I should have

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.080
probably said go to details

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.240
or something like that.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.460
Anyway, the point
I'm making here is that

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.400
a lot of product names

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.560
sometimes have, I'm not really descriptive
of what the thing is.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.960
For example, here I've chose product names

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.870
such as Birdy Max Ultra Precision,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.470
and then the image shows a telescope

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.470
or Birdy Max Lightweight On The Go.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:25.410
You wouldn't know

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.780
from this headline if you

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.280
didn't have the image of the binoculars

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.780
that these would actually be binoculars.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.820
I think you can't rely with e-commerce

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:42.460
that the title is always very descriptive
and you don't need the image anymore

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.630
and also there's some often variations
of the same product

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.880
and you need to show that in an image.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.400
Here it's definitely a case for
alternative text

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.470
and so here I'm showing again

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.620
the HTML markup and I'm adding
the alternative text in here.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.650
The Birdy Max Ultra Precision is a purple
telescope with a three-legged stand.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.770
That is the alternative text.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.290
The problem with this approach

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.660
though is that when a screen reader user

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.030
navigates the page
by listing out all the headlines

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.060
and then jumping to the headline
that they find interesting,

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.880
they might miss the image because
they jump directly to the headline

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.200
and here the image
is before the headline.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.600
They would jump right over it.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.440
A better semantic or structure,
logical structure of this

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.390
would be to have the headline

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.190
before the image.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.630
This is what I'm showing here with this.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.700
I changed the card layout around

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.820
so that the image is below the headline.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.480
I don't know about you,

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.220
but my designer would not like
if I did that.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:06.240
Usually, you have the image

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.440
first in the visual layout.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.350
What you can do then,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.850
luckily, you can use a Flexbox CSS layout,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.390
and there if you then mark it up

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.990
as flex-direction column,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.830
you can change the order,

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:31.060
the visual order of the image
of the items with CSS

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.140
so you give the image a negative order

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.770
so it comes up on top.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.410
In many, many cases, you're not supposed
to change the visual layout

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.420
of the of a page with CSS
because it can be very confusing,

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:51.090
for example, for the tab order

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.090
but in this case,
the image is not tabable.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.000
We're not messing with the tab order
this way.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.570
I think it can be permitted.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.740
The only thing would be maybe

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.970
a sighted screen reader user

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.910
would maybe be a bit confused

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.610
why the visual order
doesn't match the order that is read.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.280
I'm hoping
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.020
but I'm hoping that
this is just a slight irritation.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.240
It's still the best compromise.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.460
Also, if you get
this is a very common pattern

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.130
so I'm expecting people to know

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.750
this pattern a bit.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.400
I'm coming to the end.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.230
Now the most important takeaways,

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.140
format your cards as a list.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.240
Put a link

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.670
around the most important elements.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.880
Make the whole card clickable
by adding a pseudo-element

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.480
or using this JavaScript trick.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.580
If you have additional links

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.590
in the card, make them clickable
by raising them above the pseudo-element

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.390
with Z-index
and adding padding to reduce mis-taps.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.260
Also, make it clear what the card does
with a descriptive call to action

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.600
connected to the link
with ARIA-describe-by.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.740
Add focus on hover styles
to the whole card.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.740
Add empty alt text
if the image is decorative.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.580
Add alt text for any images
that add important information

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.180
and in that case, consider changing

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.020
if the image is before

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.650
the headline,

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.220
consider changing the visual order.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.330
That is that.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.160
I would be super happy if you connected
with me, for example, on LinkedIn,

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.870
and share your card designs.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.530
Thank you very much.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.970
Tina,
thank you so much for your presentation.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.380
We've had a very lively chat
and a lot of technical questions

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.980
in the Q&amp;A that may just be short answer
or you may have answered them.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.420
I'm just going to read them
and we'll start that way.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.250
Does the trick
with the pseudo-element work

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.260
well for voice users?

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.750
<v Tina> That is a very good question.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:13.860
I'll have to test that.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.730
Honestly, I have not tested it
but I think for voice users,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.100
my assumption is that

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.410
what makes it accessible for voice
is the name of the link.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.880
Yes, this is definitely something.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.080
This is a really good point,
thank you for bringing this up.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.860
<v Tina> I'm going to give it a think.
<v Sherose> Absolutely.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.790
Another technical question.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.660
For mobile,
how big should the margins, in pixels

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.360
perhaps, should they be to separate
one card from another?

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.200
Is there some standard for that?

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.170
<v Tina>
There's no standard as far as I know.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.000
I would test it.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:57.480
Just be on a mobile, use your thumb

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.280
but there's no like official guideline
or anything that I know of.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:04.840
<v Sherose> Excellent.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.120
Another question.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.050
For keyboard navigation,
putting the focus on the card is enough

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:17.080
to determine that it's clickable element
or should the focus go on read more?

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Tina> Yes, also a good question.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.900
I think that there's not a super right
or wrong answer with that.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.470
It depends on when you test it,
what is the most understandable.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.310
I think I usually put it on the whole card

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.370
to say, "This is the element
that you can click."

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.240
I don't know but yes.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.820
Then I also add hover styles to it
to make it a bit more clear.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Sherose> To that end, we have
another question in the Q&amp;A.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.500
Can you accomplish this on a beginner
level by making the card full focus

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.110
when you hover and be okay with that
or do you have to create a card

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.550
and then add the CSS?

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.250
<v Tina> Sorry, can you say it again?

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.390
<v Sherose> Sure, yes,
I'll read it word for word.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.360
Can you accomplish this
on a beginner level

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.830
by making the card full focus
when you hover and be okay with that

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.560
or do you have to create the card

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.800
and add CSS?

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.800
<v Tina> Yes, so just using the hover
would not be enough

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.280
because it would only be accessible
to mouse users.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.950
I'm not sure if I get the question

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:48.480
right but generally, this is to anybody
who is seeing this

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.390
and is like,
"Okay this is not beginner level,"

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:54.660
then yes,
it's unfortunate that a lot of themes

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.230
make it really hard to do this
out of the box.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.500
This is more like--
What I've shown here is more like, "Okay,

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.730
this is when I custom
PHP write my templates, how I do it."

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.640
but also really take
a look at this.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.510
For example, what Amber Hinds
did [?] with

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.650
the page builder comparison.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.980
If this is a bit too technical,

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.520
then really make sure
that you do your research

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.480
when you choose a theme
so that hopefully most of these features

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.430
are already provided by the theme,

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.910
which is what I think
all themes should do.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.430
<v Sherose> I think also in some cases,

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.030
Tina, the developers are in a position

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.100
where they have to use a theme selected
for them.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.940
In that case, they may be developing
with the block editor

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.540
and have limited access to the back end,
if any.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.980
In that case, it's possible that then

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.950
developing the card would show

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.450
that it only has hover focus.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:01.020
Then, in that case,
they would have to use custom

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.430
<v Sherose> CSS to add [crosstalk].
<v Tina> Yes, yes, yes.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.200
<v Tina> In that case, you need to add CSS.
<v Sherose> Thank you.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.370
We have a question about the DOM.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.940
Shouldn't the heading start the card

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.600
even if visually it's the image
before the heading?

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.570
This is a pattern
I've seen often in inclusive components.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.310
<v Tina> The question would be
should it just always start-

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.800
<v Sherose> Yes--
<v Tina> with a headline?

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:35.260
<v Tina> Yes.
<v Sherose> Yes, visually we'll see the image

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.660
and whether or not that has alt
text is one thing.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.030
We'll have the image,
the heading, the blurb,

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.930
and then there's a button for read more,
learn more.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.870
The question is asking in the DOM,
shouldn't it be switched

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.820
so that the heading comes
before the image?

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.150
<v Tina> Yes, I think that this depends on
what this image is.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.320
Does it really add information or not?

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.680
If it's a decorative image,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.250
then I don't think it matters
that it is before the headline

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.590
but if anybody has a different
take on this and something that

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.060
I might not have considered,
then I'm super happy to discuss this

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.240
and people can reach out to me.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.000
<v Sherose> I'm watching the chat to see
if there's any more input on that one.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.540
Another more technical question.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.810
Would the article elements in a list

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.410
make more sense semantically
for the card?

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.400
<v Tina> Article elements in a list.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.450
<v Sherose>
That's what the question is asking.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:37.060
I'm not too familiar with [?] the article
element or seeing it in [?] block.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Tina> Yes, I don't think--

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:51.730
A list has to list item in it
to be HTML valid.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.140
I'm not sure if you can add

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.940
a landmark in there
and still have proper HTML

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.280
and I don't see the--

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:08.660
The article would not really give
any additional value

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.520
to the element in my view.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.930
I don't think I would do that.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:21.530
<v Sherose> They are saying that they meant
to use UL then the list item

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.930
and within the list item, the article but
I think what you're saying [crosstalk]-

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.000
<v Tina> I'm not sure if that is valid
had HTML to put a landmark in a list item.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.840
I'm not sure.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.440
It might be but, yes,
I would have to look that up.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.080
<v Sherose> Whether it works or not,
I think is one thing

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.950
but I think if you're considering
a screen reader's experience

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.520
with that,
they're navigating by certain elements.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.090
If they're navigating by them, they might
miss some contextual information

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.750
if they hit the article before
they hit a heading

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.280
or a picture [crosstalk].

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.910
<v Tina> Most screen readers right now
don't count.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.640
Don't include the article landmark
in their list of landmarks

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.240
like when you use landmark navigation.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.780
This would not add

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.450
any benefit
for a screen reader user to have a list

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.050
and then also have the article.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Sherose> Thank you, Tina.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.790
I didn't know that about articles
not being accessible for screen readers

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.000
<v Sherose> as a landmark [crosstalk].
<v Tina> Only JAWS does it.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.830
<v Sherose> That's good to know

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.700
but either way, if you're using a list
item and you have paragraph text in it,

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.430
you're making your item accessible
to screen

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.170
readers, sighted users, mouse users,
touch users.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.340
That's awesome. Thank you.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.910
Let's see.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.380
You answered this one.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.420
Could you please describe once again

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.950
what is the benefit of using
unordered lists

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.710
and list items
for the card grid and cards?

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.480
<v Tina> Yes. Welcome to it.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.900
The benefit
of using a list markup for cards

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.770
is that usually, you have multiple cards.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.370
You're showing a grid of multiple items

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.070
and when you use the list markup,

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:14.010
it gives screen reader users
additional features.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.150
For example,
they can- the screen reader reads,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.480
this is a list
and then it also reads, there are

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.790
nine items in this list
and then there are additional navigation

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:30.190
features that screen readers provide users
for specifically for lists.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.790
This is where you can give screen

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.330
readers the most benefit, I think.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:38.200
Otherwise, they just wouldn't have
that input.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Sherose> Thank you, Tina.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.270
We have time for one more question
and you did cover this,

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.880
but if you could cover it one more time
just briefly?

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.010
What is the benefit of accessibility

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.380
benefit of making the entire card
clickable versus

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.520
having just one clickable element
within it,

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.800
for example, the headline?

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.800
<v Tina> This is a question you can make

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.270
just the headline clickable,
and this would be compliant

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:16.570
and I wouldn't flag it as like,
"Oh, this is an accessibility mistake,"

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:17.670
or something like that.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.080
No, this is more about usability.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.950
I don't know about other people,
but when I see a blog list,

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:28.720
blog articles, and their images, I try,

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:34.260
especially on mobile, I click on the image
and I expect it to lead to the article,

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.770
and so I think it's something
that we're used to

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:38.390
because a lot of cards do it.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.060
Also in accessibility, you have to

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.300
take into consideration

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.800
what people are used to.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.340
Then I also think that

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.270
if you can have a bigger click area,
it is good, for example,

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.080
for people with motor issues.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.180
Sometimes it's also a requirement
that the designer says, like, "Hey,

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.110
I want this whole thing clickable."

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.120
It's a usability thing.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.860
It's not a mistake.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.130
<v Sherose> What I hear from you
then is either option

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.330
would meet WCAG criteria,

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:17.100
if that's what you're using, either option
but there is

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.430
the larger touch area
and a more common experience

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.530
in making the card itself
clickable entirely.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.060
<v Tina> Yes.
<v Sherose> Awesome.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.110
