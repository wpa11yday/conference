00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.559
<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.939
How to Juggle
Different Teams at Different Places

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.679
in Their Accessibility Journey,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.999
with speakers Lorna Notsch,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.119
Senior Content Management Analyst at Sage,
and Lorenzo Milani,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.159
Associate UX
Specialist at Sage Publishing.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.680
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.559
<v Piccia Neri> Welcome once again
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.719
Once more, my name is Piccia Neri,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
and I'm a UX and accessible
design designer.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340
[chuckles]

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.359
Thank you for joining us for this session,
How to Juggle

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.239
Different Teams at Different Places
in Their Accessibility Journey,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.160
with Lorna Notsch and Lorenzo Milani.

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:50.480
Lorna lives in Washington, DC.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.599
Thank you for getting
up so early to be with us,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.479
and has worked on digital accessibility
for about 12 years.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.179
She's a trusted tester

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.060
and an IAAP-Certified CPWA.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.879
At Sage, she works across
teams and departments

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.599
on digital accessibility,
education, testing,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.719
and accessibility documentation
creation and maintenance.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.719
When not at work,
Lorna enjoys exploring her city,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.760
travel, reading,
and tending her many houseplants.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.719
Lorenzo is a UX specialist
based in London,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.799
and has been at Sage for six years.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.719
The bulk of his work
is on digital accessibility,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.799
working with the user
experience and product

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.799
management teams to ensure
products are designed, built,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.959
and tested with accessibility
at the forefront.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.767
While his focus is on the strategic aspect
of accessibility,

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:56.959
Lorenzo is also involved
in testing requirements and training.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.519
He balances this work with product
analytics and information architecture.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.399
Outside of work, Lorenzo is a bass player,
tennis player, and hiker.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.719
Once more, this is so relevant to me,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.839
as I'm sure to lots
of people in the audience.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.680
Over to you, Lorna and Lorenzo,
with your presentation.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.159
<v Lorna Notsch> Thank you so much.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.206
All right, Lorenzo,
if you just bring our slides up.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.139
<v Lorenzo Milani> There they are.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.119
Hi, everyone.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.979
<v Lorna> All right.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.240
Hello.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.799
Well, as you've been told,
our presentation is How to Juggle

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.399
Different Teams at Different Places
in Their Accessibility Journey.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.239
We are so excited to be presenting here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.572
today at WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.079
Now, we have set
some goals out for this session.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.879
By the end, hopefully
you will be able to set

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.720
an accessibility baseline
for a team or product,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.959
facilitate collaboration
and progress across teams,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.799
and consider your current
approach to accessibility,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.919
and how to best move forward.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.159
What you'll notice throughout

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.879
our presentation
is whether spoken or implied,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.119
we do have themes and threads
that carry through consistent

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.680
things that we've found
have worked well across our teams,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.334
and across our processes and workflows.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.759
Now, you already know all about us,
so we're just going to skip that.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.410
You can use it
for future reference. [chuckles]

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.399
<v Lorenzo> Yes, thanks for the intros.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.679
Apologies for not wearing the shirt today,
it was in the wash.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.663
I just realized too late

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.968
but I have been wearing
it over the past few days.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.359
We wanted to start off
by going back a few years

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.200
with a very brief history
of accessibility at Sage Publishing.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.599
Sage is an academic publisher,
publish journals, books,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.726
and different materials
for universities and schools.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.488
Let's rewind the clocks
a bit and go back to 2013.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.919
A customer had reached out
to Sage about one of our products.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.759
What they'd done is that they'd asked
a third-party evaluator

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.759
to assess our product
and we were taken by surprise.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.074
The results were not pretty.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.039
Mainly, we did not know
what digital accessibility was,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.879
and so lots of self-education and training

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.592
of several individuals was needed
and occurred over the subsequent years.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.919
What was the result of this training?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.236
Well, at present, Sage routinely
tests products for WCAG compliance,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.159
and although knowledge
is still largely held

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.639
by several individuals
across the organization,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.799
we're trying to change that, and rather
embedding the knowledge in teams,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.243
in roles, and in departments,
and in the company culture.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.579
Given that we focused a lot

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.079
on our external platforms and products,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.519
our customer-facing platforms
and products,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.399
we're now turning inwards and reviewing

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.039
our internal systems for accessibility.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.360
That's a whole other game as well.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.037
Why did we choose this topic?

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.040
Sage creates and supports
its own products in-house.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.374
We have various teams dedicated to that.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.919
We also purchase companies and products

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.959
that complement
the company vision and mission.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.799
We work with third-party vendors
that support Sage content,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.798
and we also utilize third-party products
for internal processes.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.279
We work with vendors
that perhaps supply features

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.679
or widgets that are embedded
within our platforms and sites,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.959
and we also use
larger third-party products

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.679
to help drive the processes that then help

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.320
maintain and create these customer
and external-facing platforms.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.599
This all means that we have a lot of teams
in different places

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.726
in their accessibility
journey that all need support.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.637
<v Lorna> The first thing we do,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.359
whether we are bringing
a product into the Sage stable,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.479
whether we are creating
a product from scratch,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.279
or whether we are turning
to an existing legacy product at Sage,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.925
we need to establish a baseline.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.639
What we've found is we're really trying

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.999
more and more to make accessibility
part of the acquisition,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.559
vendor, or product design conversation.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.160
Up front, we have to get accessibility
up front and out there on top of mind.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.759
If we're dealing with external
vendors or an acquisition,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.479
then we request documentation, and we say,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.999
"What accessibility documentation
do you have on hand for your product?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.479
We more and more are incorporating
it into contracts.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.999
If we're contracting
with an external vendor,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.400
we say accessibility
really has to be part of our relationship.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.879
If we're building a product from scratch,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.523
we get it into the product requirements.

00:07:29.524 --> 00:07:34.320
Up front, you can't bolt it on,
you've got to build it in.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.279
If we're dealing with a legacy product,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.039
we also then go
on to the second bullet here,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.239
which is where we commission
an external review,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.176
or we conduct an internal assessment.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.040
That also happens if we do an acquisition.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.799
Once those evaluation
results are available,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.279
then we can begin
to discuss a remediation plan.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.999
Once we find where there
may be shortcomings in a product,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.639
we're like, "Okay,
how can we make this better?"

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.759
What we have found,
and it may seem straightforward,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.160
but it's not always the case,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.839
it is usually the case
that the less accessible

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.639
the product,
the more education and training

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.528
the team is likely
going to need on accessibility.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.959
Some of the things that
we have put into place

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:38.387
since 2013 to achieve our goals
of digital accessibility at Sage,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.959
we've organized
a voluntary cross-company accessibility

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.953
working group, or AWG.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.199
In recent years, we've been able to work

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.999
really closely with the company employee
resource groups, or ERGs,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.239
and we've leveraged
that combined voice to get,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.320
again, accessibility up front,
top of mind, and discussed.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.804
The AWG is also an opportunity
to promote efficiencies.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.079
We know that people already often perceive

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.279
accessibility as one more thing
they need to do,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.919
one more thing they need to be aware of,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.559
so by having this place where people

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.719
can come together to share ideas,
successes, workflow ideas,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.800
the challenges they've
encountered, documentation,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.719
we can promote those efficiencies

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.759
so we're not having
people duplicate effort.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.279
It also avoids siloing, which is something

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.639
that can frequently happen
at a large company especially.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.199
We provide training and education
tailored to the audience.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.919
At this point,
we have a core resource library

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.639
so that we don't have to reinvent
the wheel every time.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.759
We are able to put
it on a different vehicle,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.239
so we have the core material to draw from,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.919
and then we customize
and tweak each presentation

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.280
or each education session
to the specific team or department.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.999
We've also developed process mapping

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.399
so that we can show
where accessibility can be incorporated

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.732
and should be incorporated into workflows.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.839
We now have a user experience
scorecard that incorporates WCAG

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.076
criteria and accessibility maturity
level for each of our products.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.199
We also encourage active
Teams and Slack channels

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.767
to promote ad hoc communication.

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:45.200
What we often find is somebody
may be intimidated to come

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.879
to a formal meeting or put
their question out there to a group,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.609
but if they can just slip
it into a team's chat,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.719
"I'm encountering this challenge.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.447
Has anyone else encountered that?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.020
Could you share with me your ideas?"

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.859
They're often more comfortable doing that,
and we welcome that.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.540
We encourage that.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.999
During this education and training,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.079
it's the ideal opportunity
to cite the returns on investments

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.519
for accessibility because we know
there are many for all users,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.439
and also the risks for launching
and perpetuating

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.614
inaccessible products and functionality.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.939
One of the things
we've continually had to do

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.919
is we are the cheerleaders
for digital accessibility at Sage.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.966
We are continually reaching
out and being proactive,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.919
keeping accessibility
in all conversations.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.680
We are always persistent,
but we're also always enthusiastic.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.039
We don't want to come
off as we're nagging you.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.639
We want to come off as, hey,
this is a great value asset to add

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.814
to your product and to the conversation.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.479
More and more,
we're pushing back to introduce ownership

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.839
and accountability
of digital accessibility.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.520
As we noted earlier,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.659
it was initially,
and it still is a bit owned

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:21.080
by a few individuals,
but we're expanding that scope,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.239
and we found that once somebody
has skin in the game,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.599
once they're invested,
and they are accountable,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.279
then they are much more likely to endorse

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.454
and further digital accessibility goals.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.279
<v Lorenzo> In order to illustrate
Lorna's points and also illustrate

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.359
the lessons we have learned
in our journey,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.199
we've put together a few case studies

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.839
with products and platforms
that we've worked on,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.719
and show the particular aspects
of working with each,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.621
and what we've learned.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.959
We're going to start off with Epigeum.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.599
Epigeum is a platform that develops
bespoke online courses

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.554
because they develop them
collaboratively with universities.

00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:13.999
Epigeum is a relative newcomer to Sage.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.936
They were purchased in March of 2023.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.239
They were a UK-based company,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.572
and I believe their team
is still UK-based.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.359
The team was already aware
of accessibility,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.359
but they weren't sure
of where to start in terms of alignment,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.239
in terms of how to address
the platform and the product.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.479
What they did is that they collaborated
with the accessibility team,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.519
starting with myself and Lorna,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.679
to have the product evaluated
by Tech For All, known as TFA.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.559
They are a third-party evaluator
that specialize in evaluating

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.606
comprehensively platforms
for digital accessibility,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.909
compliance, and usability.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.399
What they did next was fantastic.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.559
They took the evaluation and immediately
focused on remediation.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.479
The first step was dividing
the issues identified

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.877
between platform and content.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.879
What we all learned from that is sometimes
the lines are blurry.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.698
Sometimes they're not.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.199
An issue could specifically
be related to the platform,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.879
and sometimes, instead,
it's an editorial decision,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.679
but given that the courses were hosted

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.806
on the platform but were separate,
lines were blurry.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.919
The main challenge here
was resource allocation.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.079
Where do you allocate
the accessibility resource

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.079
for the platform and for the content
if the issue isn't clear-cut?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.759
That's something
the team was really focusing

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.092
on identifying
and defining from the start.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.359
The team was really proactive
in seeking education and training,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.690
especially the product manager,

00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:53.975
who we now have a very close
working relationship with.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.919
He was also, and the team overall,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.799
were also proactive in exploring
solutions before reaching out.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.279
Instead of handing us a list of issues
and asking, "How do you fix this?"

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.199
They would try out solutions themselves,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.215
learn how to use assistive technology,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.439
navigate the page via different means,
such as via the keyboard,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.359
and then reaching out to us
for sense checks and saying,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.907
"Well, is this how it's supposed to work?

00:15:19.908 --> 00:15:20.759
Am I being crazy?

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.880
Is this the completely wrong approach?"

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.439
Instead of being a one-way street,
it was more of a two-way collaboration,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.719
which was great to see
and something we don't always

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.814
find when working with different teams.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.439
What really surprised us
is that instead of bolting on the fixes,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.994
sometimes the team went back
and redesigned elements for accessibility,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.839
given that they designed
courses that were pretty much

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.479
complete at this point
in their perspective.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.439
Instead of bolting
on an accessible solution

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.250
to a specific feature or a widget,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.319
they realized that it was going to be much

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.199
more effective and robust
to go back and say,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.599
"We'll redesign
that interaction for the user,"

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.919
or "we'll get rid of it, and implement
something completely different,"

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.239
which made our job easier
because we wouldn't have to suggest

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.680
workarounds that would work
and wouldn't be robust.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.679
The result of all this
is that for the Epigeum team,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.799
they really now do consider
accessibility in enhancements,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.039
and just as part of business as usual.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.200
It's really become
a very embedded process for them.

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:34.199
<v Lorna> Our second case
study is a bit of a contrast.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.079
It's Hubro.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.939
They do business simulations,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.955
and they are also based out of Europe.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.439
They were purchased
by Sage in June of 2023.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.559
At that point, the team was not [clears
throat] familiar with accessibility,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.844
but assessment did become
part of the purchase process.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.679
The team did know
going in that when Sage purchased them,

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.319
there would be an accessibility
evaluation occurring

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.049
to ensure that we had
that baseline established.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.479
They collaborated with Lorenzo and myself,
and the accessibility team

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.320
in general to have the product evaluated
also by Tech For All.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.639
Different from Epigeum,
but it is sort of an apples and oranges,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.599
they took that evaluation
and they've slowly focused on remediation.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.199
The primary challenge here
was the product was built

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.691
on a system that's
not inherently accessible.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.599
Not only is Epigeum
product distinct from Hubro's,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.359
but they also were built
on very different foundations

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.982
because there wasn't
that initial awareness

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.899
at Hubro of digital accessibility,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.620
so they didn't know
to look for a foundation

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.320
that would aid them
in being accessible later.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.279
It's also a very, very small team,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.680
and accessibility is nearly
a single-person effort.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.139
That's why we've tried to encourage
more cross-team collaboration

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.199
beyond that single developer.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.999
We put individuals at Hubro
in touch with other developers

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.960
and other designers at Sage to facilitate
communication and conversation.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.959
How did you deal with this?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.519
How would you best approach this?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.320
What code fix are you using here?

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.379
We found that to be really helpful

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.446
and encouraging for them.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.159
They're still working on making
accessibility part of business as usual,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.199
but it's something they're very aware of.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.880
It's just been a slower process for them.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.879
<v Lorenzo> Next up, we have Sage Journals,
which is our academic journals platform.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.719
This is a vast platform.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.719
It hosts lots of content.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.119
The peculiarity for this platform
is that it is hosted

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.920
on Atypon's Literatum template
and platform since 2015.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.799
Atypon are a third-party provider
that provides

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.974
publishers with templates and platforms.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.959
The challenge here, but also the benefit,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.482
is that the internal Sage team
works with the Atypon team.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.201
This adds a layer of communication
and scheduling alignment.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.253
Sage is not Atypon's only customer,

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.079
and although Sage has
a dedicated team at Atypon

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.520
that focus on our relationship with them,

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:44.239
Atypon has an organization,
have multiple priorities,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.600
so it takes longer to get
things through sometimes.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.768
Thankfully, Atypon
is committed to accessibility.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.439
The main benefit of working with them

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.519
as a partner is that
there's a two-way exchange.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.159
They benefit from our insights
in accessibility,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.119
and we also benefit
from their commitment and their insights.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.559
There are lots of conversations.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.519
There's lots of knowledge sharing.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.219
Although the process
might be a bit more formal

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.639
and take a bit longer, ultimately,
we've seen great benefits with working

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.131
with a third-party for such
a large platform.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.119
<v Lorna> Our next case study is Plandek,
which provides metrics and analytics.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.319
In spring of 2024,
the Sage Technology Department signed

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.919
an agreement with Plandek to deliver

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.960
the metrics and analytics to assist
teams in their performance goals.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.079
Accessibility at that point was not part
of the pre-contract discussion.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.599
However, once I saw
the presentation saying

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.120
that they were coming
in to assist us in technology,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.854
I reached out to them directly and said,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.239
"Could we discuss
the product's accessibility?"

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.839
Now, this was not something
that was on their radar at first,

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.579
but that being said, they really took up

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.639
the initiative and went forward.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.083
They have since created
a VPAT for their Plandek product,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.319
and they have committed to assessing

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.320
their product against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.979
They went from basically 0 to 60

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.560
in a very, very short time.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.719
The lesson here
is that it's always worth asking

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.760
about accessibility
at any point in the conversation.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.159
While we encourage,
again, to get that baseline,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.520
to incorporate it as early
and upfront as possible,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.079
that's not always the reality.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.759
That does not mean
that accessibility can't come

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.439
into the discussion later
and that it can't have benefits

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.328
because this is definitely
a case study that shows

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.600
companies will take
the initiative and move forward with it.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.479
<v Lorenzo> Our final case study
groups together different products

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.239
that Sage creates internally from design

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.424
and conception to development,
testing, and launch.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.519
These include books, courses,
business cases, datasets, and more.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.719
We've grouped them together

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.080
because the lessons learned
are very similar.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.439
I'm going to start with the challenges.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.239
First off is executive buy-in,
specifically around accessibility.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.079
While that depends
on the product and on the specific feature

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.399
being launched, we always have to advocate
for accessibility,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.210
especially at the executive level.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.159
Some features might be shiny,
and so we have to remind teams about

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.060
the need for accessibility early on,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.279
but because there's so
many different teams

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.959
and so many different things
being worked on,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.324
just knowing about projects
and products is a challenge.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.759
There's not many of us
solely focused on accessibility,

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.599
so sometimes we'll miss something

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.999
on the grapevine or we'll miss
something officially,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.719
and so we won't have
the opportunity to be able to play

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.399
that advocacy role or that design
role or that consultant role

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.239
for the team regarding accessibility.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.039
This is mainly because accessibility

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.079
still tends to reside with individuals

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.439
and not the role or within the team.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.679
That's something we're really working

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.280
on to decentralize
accessibility responsibility.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.723
It's happening across varying
degrees across the company.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.519
What this leads
to is siloing of accessibility

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.082
information and best practices.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.679
One team might learn lessons and implement

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.719
a very robust accessibility process,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.959
for example, the design phase,
but another team,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.079
especially if they're across
the ocean in the States or in India,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.759
for example,
they might not know that that process

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.279
was implemented and formalized,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.480
and so they'll just go ahead
and do their own thing.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.719
A lot of time and energy
could have been saved

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.814
if that information hadn't been siloed.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.279
The result of all these challenges
is that sometimes

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.719
the decision to de-scope accessibility
does happen to varying degrees.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.599
That results in bolting
on rather than building in,

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.919
which we're always happy to,
again, assist in that bolting on.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.156
Better late than never, but we always aim
for as early as possible.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Lorna> In support of the
"get accessibility into a product early,"

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.239
I'm not sure how many of you out
there are familiar with Boehm's Curve.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.159
It's a favorite of mine because I think

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.740
it's a perfect encapsulation

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.019
of the literal cost of bolting

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.670
on accessibility
after the launch of a product.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.519
The graphic on this slide
shows a line graph,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.659
and the X-axis is the various stages

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.600
of deployment of a product.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.079
The Y-axis is the cost
going up, of course.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.239
Then there is a line going up
that shows the cost increase

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.360
across the steps of product deployment.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:00.240
If you incorporate accessibility
at the requirement stage,

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.200
the cost is little to none.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.919
It really is no effort.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.046
You just incorporate
it like you would anything else.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.320
If you get to accessibility
at the design stage,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.559
the cost is still relatively
low but it's about double

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.892
what it would be at the requirement stage.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.999
Moving on to the coding stage,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.279
if you decide at that point,
if you've written

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.719
the requirements and you've finalized

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.799
the designs and now you're coding them,
but now you're like,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.132
"Oh, I've got to deal with accessibility,"

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.280
then the cost doubles
again from the design stage.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.719
Moving on to testing,
if somebody's testing and says,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.079
"Oh, was accessibility considered
when you designed this product?"

00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:00.239
"No, okay, I guess we have to go
back and incorporate it now."

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.039
The test doubles again,
or the cost doubles

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.360
again from the coding stage.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.739
Finally, at deployment, if you bolt

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.320
on accessibility after you've launched
the product or at deployment,

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.279
the cost has doubled
yet again from testing.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.340
It has grown exponentially from the cost

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.560
of incorporating
it at the requirement stage.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.799
I love to share this graphic
internally when individuals say,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.579
"Well, we just don't have the time to work

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.120
on accessibility right now."

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.919
I always answer, "Well, that's fine.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.559
We're happy to work
with you whenever you're ready.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.239
We'll meet you where you are."

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:57.799
However, just so you know, it literally
will cost you more in money, time,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.240
and resources to do it later
than it will earlier.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.399
If you're willing to take
that cost and eat that, okay,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.640
but just don't say we didn't tell you so.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.319
Now, we've looked
at the challenges and we've stressed

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.679
how we convey
that there are risks and costs

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.933
to not incorporating accessibility early,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.799
but there are successes.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.279
We've definitely had successes,
or we wouldn't be here,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.961
we wouldn't be giving
this presentation so enthusiastically.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.160
The first of those is that we've seen
an increased appreciation

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.399
for the efficiencies gained
by building accessibility in.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.320
Boehm's Curve is working.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.759
Second is we've been able to build
relationships within and across teams.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.999
I think you've seen
that from the previous slides

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.479
that we really try
to foster that community,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.199
that relationship, that conversation,
whether formal or informal,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.479
to share experiences, to share ideas,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.359
workflows, successes, challenges,
et cetera., and it's working.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.253
We are shifting left more and more.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.260
That's been a movement across Sage

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.883
for several different initiatives.

00:29:29.884 --> 00:29:34.399
Fortunately,
accessibility has been able to incorporate

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.599
into that general shift left
so that it's considered earlier,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.646
and obviously,
then it's less effort to incorporate.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:50.439
We are now incorporating more user
testing with those with disabilities.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:56.360
We are using better user
experience practices in general.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.659
We're always on the lookout

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.439
for how to do something better to serve

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.931
both our internal
and our external customers.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.959
At this point, remediation
of accessibility issues is now pretty much

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.079
business as usual for most Sage products.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.999
If a customer comes to us
with a concern or if we find

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.066
something in our testing,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.559
it's not a big deal
anymore to address that.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:32.159
It's just something that's incorporated
into a sprint like anything else,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.800
any other bug,
or technical challenge would be.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.159
<v Lorenzo> Our end goals
for teams regarding accessibility

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.476
really is ownership and accountability
of accessibility integration.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.719
That's what we really aspire
for every team.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:01.039
They own the accessibility product
and they're accountable for it.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.479
We're trying to push that goal
through two approaches.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.629
The first being education.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.079
We provide a general education
across the organization to really raise

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.319
awareness around accessibility.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.999
We've done that in multiple ways.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.325
Lunch and Learns, for example,

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:23.199
a good way to start
talking about a specific topic

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.999
or an introductory topic
whilst having lunch.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.559
That was possible before COVID.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.999
Now you have to bring your own lunch
if you're working remotely.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.919
We've also talked about accessibility
in department presentations.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.839
Mainly in ways that we've succeeded
in incorporating accessibility

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.119
practices and in ways that products
have become more accessible,

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.079
and also talking about
what's going to happen in the future.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.239
We also work with and want to work

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.639
more with the employee resource
groups to talk

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.759
about accessible practices both in product

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.092
development but also within the workplace.

00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:04.799
Lorna's been writing an excellent series
of articles and newsletters

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.879
that gets sent every so often
to members of Sage across various

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.119
departments focusing
on a very specific way to incorporate

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.599
accessible practices such
as writing strong link language,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.840
or writing effective alt text,
or keyboard testing, for example.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.479
We're also focusing
on more specialist training,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.799
especially on training people

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.212
who can then go
and educate their own teams.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.079
Teaching someone to fish rather
than just handing them a fish.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.879
This includes various teams
such as content creators,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.835
whether they're content creators

00:32:44.836 --> 00:32:47.159
from a more editorial
perspective or people

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.555
working in CMSs or people just
creating content for the organization.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:59.755
We've also trained QA teams, quality
assurance teams in the why one needs

00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:03.644
to test for accessibility,
and also in techniques.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.952
Yes, in the automated testing sphere
but especially in the manual testing.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.300
We've also been training developers.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:21.359
Giving them examples of accessible
components, and also, again,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.279
training them
into why accessibility is necessary,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.119
also training designers
whether they're user

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.214
experience or user interface designers.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.239
We always have a foundation that we bring
to these training sessions,

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.479
but we also try to tailor them
to the team so they can start

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.495
immediately applying it to their role.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.199
It's truly heartwarming when teams request

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.399
training and bring their own
problems and projects

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.399
that they are working on instead of us

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.839
solely having to push
the training on them,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.119
or asking them to participate.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.839
We recently had
an example with another team.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.039
Made online courses

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.799
where they had quite a large PDF
remediation project

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.439
ahead and they asked us specifically
to train them on PDF remediation.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.919
We took a couple of hours
and went through examples

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.280
and techniques
on how to also build accessible PDFs.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.359
Actually, yesterday
we had the proof that someone built

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.679
and remediated a PDF and it was excellent.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.159
I can see Lorna smiling
because she then tested it,

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.841
and we were happy to see
that the training paid off as well.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.279
The other approach to ownership
and accountability is empowerment.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.119
Really empowering teams
to pursue accessibility work

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.960
and to always embrace
accessibility in their work.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.239
Education plays
a very strong part in that.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.040
Not just in telling
you how and what to do,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.290
but also demystifying
some accessibility work.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.759
Promoting the notion
of everyday accessibility,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.520
that you can start right
now working on accessible practices.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.439
We're always trying
to make sure that accessibility

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.376
work doesn't have to be intimidating,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.719
and even just simple awareness
is a very effective starting point.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.879
Showing how much one can do without much

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.895
training and then building from there.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.119
We found that sessions
that really embed that awareness

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.373
serve off as an excellent starting point.

00:35:27.502 --> 00:35:31.479
The checklists are seen
as reductive and unnecessary,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.679
but we've also been including
them in certain areas such

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.520
as the user experience scorecard
that Lorna mentioned earlier.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.999
We're using them
mainly as a place to start

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.253
conversations and workflow incorporation.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.279
We have a checklist surrounding

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.559
the accessibility maturity
process for a team,

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.959
and then we'll score a team based on that.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.639
Instead of leaving the score at that,

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.519
and just waiting
[chuckles] until it improves,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.479
the expectation,
and what we want to do is either

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.679
the team approaches us
or we approach them and say,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.839
"Well, why didn't you pick this checkbox?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.440
Why did you score so low?"

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.719
Then we work with them to make sure
that we can increase their score

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.199
by incorporating
new processes and guiding them

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.800
to a more mature accessible workflow.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.439
Another thing
is that while it is mine and Lorna's jobs

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.399
to review work and to consult
teams on accessible practices,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.999
we really encourage them to be proactive

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.760
in presenting
an answer and testing things.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.599
Getting into the nitty-gritty
of a problem and trying

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.879
to understand why and maybe
what a possible solution

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.919
could be to that problem.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.319
The example I gave before about Epigeum

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:53.119
was for us one of the best scenarios
in which someone whose accessibility

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.039
was not their sole focus
decided to try out solutions,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.293
investigate problems and then come to us.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.279
The result of that was a much deeper
conversation about why certain

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.439
functionalities of the platform needed
to be accessible,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.159
and how they could be accessible
rather than us saying,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.759
"You should do this and you'll pass,"

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.439
whether it was WCAG
compliance or something else.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.279
It led to a much more
meaningful conversation

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.612
and a better accessibility
process overall.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.559
Then finally we're always trying
to cross pollinate teams

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.227
by showing how success
in one area can be applied elsewhere.

00:37:32.228 --> 00:37:35.119
As Lorna mentioned,
there's no need to reinvent the wheel,

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.831
but we also want to make sure that teams

00:37:37.832 --> 00:37:41.159
are also inspired
by accessibility successes.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.079
For example,
internal developers have begun building

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.206
a component library
that really embeds accessibility,

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.079
and so we really want to share
that across the business.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.959
Not just as a, "Oh, you can reuse this."

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.459
That's an excellent lean win
but we also share it as a success story.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.879
As, look, how a team
took it upon themselves

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.133
to build an accessible component library.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:11.039
We find that inspires teams and members

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.940
across the organization quite a lot.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.859
<v Lorna> To wrap up,
we have some recommendations

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.600
and final thoughts.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.559
If you haven't got this already,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.640
mention accessibility
early and mention it often.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.240
Be persistent, also enthusiastic.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.738
It does pay dividends.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.719
It can be frustrating
and it can be exhausting

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.719
sometimes but it really does
make a difference.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.480
We're living proof.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.999
Connected to that.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.800
Don't be afraid to be proactive.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.279
As demonstrated with Plandek,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:59.279
it really does pay off to reach out
to teams, to vendors, to partners.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.319
Even if they're not aware
of accessibility,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.480
that doesn't mean
they can't or won't embrace it.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.879
Related to that though.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.360
Don't be discouraged
if at first people don't hear you.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.959
It probably is because their top priority

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.839
may be different from yours in the moment.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.919
You may be solely
focused on accessibility,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.319
but this is something
that I personally had to learn.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.240
That other people in their daily grind

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.679
may have a different priority
in the moment than I do.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.359
That doesn't mean that they don't care

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.759
and it doesn't mean
that accessibility is something

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.759
that they will ignore and never get to.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.519
It just means, again, working with them,
meeting them where they are,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.519
and being flexible, adaptable,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.836
and open to what their needs
are and where they are in that journey.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.679
Which is basically the next bullet.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.959
Meet teams where they are.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.240
That being said, definitely,
reuse and adapt your resources.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.679
Don't reinvent the wheel,
put it on a different vehicle.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.819
Use those core resources
and that library that you build up

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.311
and just tweak
it and customize it as needed.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.639
First and foremost, though,
find and build a community.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.799
Even if it's only a shared chat.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.079
If you're the only one in your company

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.560
at present who's dealing
with accessibility,

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.519
find somebody else
who's at least interested

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.599
or will listen to you vent
if nothing else and get a chat,

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.679
and then build that chat,
and pretty soon you've got a community.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.880
Then maybe you can even get an AWG going,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.452
an accessibility working group,
more formal.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.679
Then one thing that we've really tried
to do here at Sage,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.919
and that's beginning to take
hold is we advocate to take

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.125
accessibility out
of the individual and into the role.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.599
Get it into job descriptions.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.091
Get it into performance
goals and milestones.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.199
Formalize it so that when somebody
leaves a role,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.919
the accessibility knowledge,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.000
the accessibility responsibilities
don't go with it.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.813
Get it embedded as much as you can.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.319
Our last message to you,
again, we're living proof.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.919
As tiring as it can be,
it can also be so rewarding.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.359
You really can do this.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.280
You can do this.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.983
Thank you for listening.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.286
We welcome any questions
you might have at this time.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.263
<v Piccia> The whole thing.

00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:11.489
It's frozen.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.238
Could you hear me before
because it was frozen for a little bit.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.799
Sorry about that.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.959
I don't know what's going on on my end.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.559
I was just saying thank you so much
for sharing your experiences,

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.679
but for putting such
a positive slant onto it.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.279
It's just there's so many
positive messages there.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.319
It was wonderful.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.519
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.413
Now, we have quite a few questions.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.639
The first one is, have you had instances

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.719
where some of the teams have relied
on external accessibility vendors

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.560
and not created their own
content or experiences?

00:42:54.162 --> 00:42:57.520
<v Lorna> Ooh, Lorenzo, I can't think of any.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.559
We definitely have elements

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.799
at Sage that have done
their own accessibility

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.120
thing and we've become aware
of that sometimes through the grapevine,

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.059
but we haven't had anyone that--

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.374
oh, maybe tells us, Lorenzo?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.359
Maybe they did their own thing?

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.479
<v Lorenzo> Yes, but they focused on it,
which was good.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.880
It was more about awareness.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.120
Well, the most recent
example is things to do with ads

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.599
and small marketing things
that in the grand scheme

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.839
of things weren't that big
but were implemented

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.119
without considering accessibility,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.119
mainly because it was meant
to be done really quickly,

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.679
and so probably a whole other list
of things weren't considered.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.199
We're often trying to also link
accessibility to other key

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.320
areas of online product
development such as security.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.719
<v Lorna> Privacy.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.869
<v Lorenzo> Privacy, exactly.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.519
Accessibility, for instance, ads,
we're like, "Oh, that shouldn't be there.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.999
That's clearly not accessible."

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.720
Then we've had to go
back and talk to the team.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.839
It's rarely done out of malice
or even it's more out of,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.079
"Oh, this needs to go out quickly,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.479
we can't consider anything
because we don't have the time."

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.639
Then it's usually spotted by someone
who's involved on that platform,

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.640
and then they'll maybe reach
out to us or spot it themselves.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.880
I'd say ads are my most recent
experience of this.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:48.154
<v Lorna> We haven't really had anybody
do their own accessibility thing,

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.799
or use accessibility.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.999
We did have a--
I'm not going to name names,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.599
our developers were using
a functionality that claimed

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:10.080
to be accessible and has ultimately
proven to be not accessible.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.159
That was another push
to get our own private

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.400
component library
going that was accessible.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.560
Our experiences are limited with trying

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.640
to do external
accessibility and bring it in.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.039
<v Piccia> Great, yes.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.339
Now, there are a few more questions,
and a couple of them

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.839
you've actually already
answered because one is,

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.279
"I'm curious about the budgeting process.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.479
What is your experience in dealing
with this investment planning?"

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.559
You've told us how you tell everyone,
"Yes, you can do it later.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.299
It's going to cost you much more."

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.420
[chuckles]

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.879
Do you want to add anything to that?

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.399
I feel like this question
was put before you handled that.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.526
I feel already I was like,
"Yes, here's your answer."

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.820
<v Lorna> Yes,

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.679
we definitely work with departments
to budget in accessibility.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.419
We have matured to that point now

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.919
where they are acknowledging and embracing

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.039
the fact that accessibility
is now something

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.580
they are going to have to invest in,

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.320
literally, with funds and resourcing.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.130
That was much
more difficult in the beginning.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.259
[clears throat]

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.659
I don't think if we had gotten that ping

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.880
from our customer in 2013, we would have--

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.759
I don't know where we'd be,

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.759
but there was definitely
a struggle at first

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.599
to get that awareness
and acknowledgment that,

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.399
"Yes, it's going to cost money.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.045
It's going to be an investment."

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.940
I think then sometimes

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.839
what can be a sell for Sage
as an academic publisher

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.439
who sells to public institutions
who are definitely held accountable

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.280
to have accessible
content is we say, look,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.999
our customers
are going to be held accountable,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.119
we're going to lose sales
if we're not accessible.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:25.720
Then that money argument becomes
a bit more, "Oh, this is an ROI.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.360
We do need to invest in this."

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.079
That might be an approach to take

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.719
if you are serving others
and you have a product,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.159
especially if your customers
demand accessibility,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.199
then you can put that back and say,
"Look, we need to be accessible.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.093
We need to literally pay for this."

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.893
<v Piccia> Yes, very, very good point.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.119
There's another question that says,
"In your experience,

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.699
what do you think
are the most important KPIs

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.979
to present to senior
leadership or executives

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.479
to continue the accessibility work?

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.716
You kind of have already given
us an idea of that with this answer.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.639
<v Lorenzo> We once had a question which was,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.239
how many people are using
this accessibility feature?

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.133
I forget. This was a few years ago.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.839
We thought, well,
it's not really about the numbers,

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.439
and it's hard to sometimes marry
that accessibility work in terms

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.999
of pure usage because that tends
to be a metric that is often cited.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.479
Well, how many people
are using the text size widget?

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.216
That was probably it.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:41.720
Then we said, "Well, how many people
are using good color contrast?

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.739
Everyone.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.880
[chuckles]

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:51.560
When we get asked about pure
quantitative KPIs, we can provide some.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.359
I think I saw a question about
the UX scorecard.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.439
That's one way we're trying
to measure that, but often we'll start

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.480
the conversation with not so much
about numbers,

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.456
it's about, one, the user experience.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.919
It is also about compliance,

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.439
and it's also about
the costs that would incur.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.019
Those are different risks
and opportunities

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.359
that we're trying to cite
that are not purely,

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.639
"Well, how many people
are going to use this?"

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.759
We found that doesn't translate
well, because it's not really about

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.919
that with a lot of pretty much
all accessibility work,

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.039
but we do get requests to quantify things

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.760
because that's how a lot
of decisions are made.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.559
That's been a head-scratcher
for a while in terms of,

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.759
well, how do we quantify
this work in a way that's measurable?

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.559
I guess, WCAG compliance is one,

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.319
but we found that that doesn't capture
the entire experience,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.360
but also the work that goes into it.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.400
<v Piccia> Yes, so you do use
UX scorecards for accessibility?

00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:03.466
<v Lorenzo> Yes. That's a fairly recent thing
that the UX team has been implementing.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.639
When we were talking about it, we said,

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.359
we definitely want
to incorporate accessibility

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:13.079
as an attribute of a product or
a platform and so the first thing

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.399
was measuring WCAG compliance,
but related to my point before,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.279
we thought that doesn't really capture
not just the accessibility level,

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.679
but the experience and also
how the team surrounding

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.799
that product is doing,
so we came up with this accessibility

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.719
maturity score and criteria
to measure at what point

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.999
in the accessibility journey
is this team at,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.570
and is that reflected
in their WCAG compliance

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.979
because that would allow
us to better address

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.919
in which area the team needs to work on,

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.319
whether it's content,
whether it's process,

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.579
whether it's anything else,
really, to then improve

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.919
that WCAG score
because if not, we thought,

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.879
"Well, people are already looking
at the WCAG score, so what?

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.699
What are we adding more to the scorecard

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.119
beyond a lot of other experience
metrics that are included?"

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.800
<v Piccia> Okay, great.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.000
That's all we have time for right now.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.879
Thank you so much, Lorna and Lorenzo.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.919
It was really a wonderful presentation

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.094
with so many insights on so many levels.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.679
For anyone who wants
to continue asking questions,

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.039
they can find you on LinkedIn
or other social medias.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.879
Just look at the profiles
and you will find them.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.239
Thank you for attending.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.133
Thank you again, Lorna and Lorenzo.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.319
If you want to continue
the conversation in social media,

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.479
reminding you of the hashtags.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.959
Let's see if I can pronounce it this time.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.219
I'm going to slow down and say

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:49.619
hashtag WPA11yDay.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.379
Remembering the camel case for day

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:57.700
and hashtag WPAD2024.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.099
You can go to the feedback page

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:06.780
on 2024.wpaccessibility.day/feedback.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:12.455
It can be anonymous feedback
and you can also enter to win a T-shirt,

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.319
and you can go and visit
the sponsors pages

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.679
to grab virtual swag and win more prizes,
because why not?

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:28.439
Now, stay tuned for the next session
at the top of the hour with Tina Rice,

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:33.359
who will talk about design
and implement accessible cards.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.479
Once again, I'm truly looking
forward to this one as a designer.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.479
Thank you so much.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.463
