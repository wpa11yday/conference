00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.460
<v Announcer> WordPress Accessibility Day 2024,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.060
Improving
and Enforcing Digital Accessibility Laws

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.140
and Standards in Africa,
with speaker Femi Taiwo,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.380
Technical Support Engineer at Syde GmbH.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.580
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Yigakpoa Samuel Ikpae> Hello, everyone.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
You're welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.940
My name is Yigakpoa Ikpae
and I'm COO from CLENT Africa.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.460
Thank you so much
for joining us for Improving

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.740
and Enforcing Digital Accessibility Laws
and Standards in Africa,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.180
with Femi Taiwo.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
A little bit about Femi Taiwo.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.780
Femi Taiwo is a dedicated IT specialist,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.980
with over eight years of experience
in development and system support.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.900
He's an active volunteer,
contributing his expertise

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.780
to the WordPress community
and the broader tech community in South Africa.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.540
Femi is passionate
about fostering diversity and inclusion

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140
within the industry,
advocating for equitable opportunities

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.620
and mentorship programs
that support underrepresented groups.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.020
His commitment
 to community development

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.580
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.660
Also, remember to use the chat
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.460
Over to you, Femi.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Femi Taiwo> Hi, everyone.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.500
My name is Femi Taiwo.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.580
Thank you for joining me
for today's presentation.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.620
I'm excited to share insight
to this important topic,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.180
Improving and Enforcing Digital
 Accessibility Laws and Standards in Africa.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.540
As we all know that
in this digital age,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.300
it is crucial to build an inclusive
digital future where everyone,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.140
regardless of their ability,
can access and benefit from technology.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.860
A little bit about me.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700
As mentioned, I'm an IT specialist.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.700
I'm currently working at Syde GmbH,
as a product support engineer.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.380
I am a passionate advocate
 for inclusion, accessibility, diversity,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.780
and mental health awareness.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.340
I am also an individual living with epilepsy,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.660
which is something I love talking about
and raising awareness for.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.740
Let's go over the agenda for today.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.380
First, we'll take a look at the current state
of digital accessibility laws in Africa,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.580
with a focus on Kenya's groundbreaking
ICT accessibility standard.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.540
We'll then explore the challenges
and opportunities facing African nations,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.220
then conclude
with a call to action for the future.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.060
Why this topic?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.260
First thing to note is that this topic
 is actually my thesis research.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.700
When I was trying to find
 a research topic earlier this year,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.020
I wanted to focus on something
 that I'm passionate about.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.220
I looked through a few topics,
 then I thought about accessibility,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.300
and I've been aware
of digital accessibility and its importance,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.420
especially as it relates
to people with disabilities.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.220
It seems it's not righteous for me.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.180
As someone living with epilepsy,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.260
I personally understand the challenges
of navigating the digital world

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.300
in a way that is accessible and safe.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.900
I realized how much digital
accessibility affects individuals,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.500
not only with physical disabilities,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.180
but also invisible disabilities like mine,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.380
so I decided to go
for digital accessibility.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.700
I was initially going to focus
on digital accessibility in general,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.380
but as I started my research,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.660
I then learned a great deal
about how much Africa

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
is lagging in terms
of digital accessibility,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.660
so I decided to switch the focus
 of my thesis research to Africa.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.620
There are three things I wanted
to take away from this talk.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.420
One is to live
with a clear understanding of the state

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.660
of digital accessibility in Africa.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.580
Two is to learn about
 the challenges and gaps

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.340
in the current digital accessibility laws.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.900
Lastly, to walk away with ideas
on how to contribute and collaborate

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.500
to close the digital accessibility gap.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.860
Let's get into it.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.660
As we all know, digital accessibility
is about making sure that digital content,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.340
whether it's a website, app,
or document is usable by everyone,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.220
including people with disabilities.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.940
This includes a wide range
of challenges from ensuring that websites

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.340
can be navigated using screen readers,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.980
to making mobile apps
accessible to individuals

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.060
with motor impairments,
or even ensuring content

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.460
is feasible to those
 with visual impairments.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.340
In Africa, a continent
of about 1.37 billion

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.460
and a fast-growing economy,
 digital accessibility

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.540
is particularly important
 because of the rapid growth

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.020
of the digital economy and the reliance
 on technology for essential services.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.820
Talking about everything
from online banking and e-commerce

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.300
to education and healthcare.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.380
However, across Africa,
there is a noticeable lack of adoption

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.940
of accessibility standards,
like the WCAG 2.1.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.740
Many websites and apps do not meet
the basic accessibility requirements,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.860
which creates a significant barrier
for millions of people with disabilities.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.940
When we look at some
 of these barriers,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.380
we see a combination
 of low infrastructure,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.780
low internet penetration,
and a lack of policy enforcement

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.140
on accessibility standards.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.460
For instance, in rural areas
where internet penetration is already low,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.380
many people with disabilities
are very disadvantaged.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.340
They may not even have access
to the tools or services

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.180
that they need to live more independently.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.500
According to studies
 that Africa's internet penetration rate

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.700
is about 43.2% compared
to 67.9% of the global average.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.620
This means millions of people

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.940
cannot access the basic digital tools
we all take for granted,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.100
let alone accessible tools designed
for those with disabilities.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.340
Let's take a look at some stats.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.100
About 10% to 15%
of the African population live with disabilities,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.540
according to UNESCO.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.380
That's more than 80 million people in Africa.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.980
Now these more than 80 million people
 face a lot of challenges

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.020
in accessing digital confidence services.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.380
This goes beyond physical spaces
like public transportations and buildings,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540
as most of us already know
 that digital platforms

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.060
are becoming
 just as essential as physical infrastructure,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.220
and yet millions of Africans are excluded

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.580
from accessing online services because websites

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.460
and apps are not designed
with inclusivity in mind.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.500
The stats to look at is,
less than 1% of government websites

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.060
in sub-Saharan Africa fully comply
with the WCAG standards.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.180
This lack of compliance
is a major barrier to digital inclusion

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.020
for people with disabilities.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.980
As we know that the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.020
provide a roadmap
 for making web content more accessible

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.060
and compliance
with this standard is very essential.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.420
The last step
to take a look at is this one,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.180
a recent update
of 15 mobile applications in Kenya.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.340
These are apps for telecommunications
 and banking industries,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.820
found that none of them cater
 to people with disabilities.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.740
This is a significant issue

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.860
given the increasing reliance
on mobile technology

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.020
for essential services in Africa.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.100
Let's take a look
at the general disability legislation in Africa.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.500
I'm focusing on four countries here,
 South Africa, Nigeria,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.380
and Morocco, then we move to Kenya.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.100
Many African nations
have enacted disability legislation,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.460
but the focus is mainly
 on physical accessibility,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.940
such as ensuring that public buildings
 and transportation are accessible.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.940
Unfortunately, digital accessibility
 is often out of the game.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.500
These laws, despite the increasing importance

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.340
of online platforms in everyday life.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.740
For instance,
the South Africa's White Paper

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.580
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.540
it is a forward-thinking piece of legislation
that addresses the full spectrum

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.460
of accessibility needs
 for people with disabilities.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.380
It focuses on physical spaces,
 making public spaces,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.300
like buildings and transportation,
 more accessible,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.420
and improving services like education

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.780
and healthcare for people
with disabilities.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.980
However, one major shortcoming
 is the lack of focus

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.220
on digital accessibility.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.900
In a world that is becoming more digital,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.020
accessibility is not just about buildings

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.340
and transport systems design,
but also digital inclusion.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.260
Without specific provisions
 for digital platforms,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.380
people with disabilities
in South Africa

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.300
are often left out
 of e-government services, online learning,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.100
online health, and even social services
 that are delivered online.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.140
I confirmed this during
 an event I attended earlier this year.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.140
When I started on my research,
 I attended a conference,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:51.220
and I decided to speak to a few people,
 just like an interview for my research.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.340
Can't remember the number
of people I spoke to,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.660
but I'd say out of 10 people
that I spoke to--

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.020
note this was a developer's conference,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.580
so most of the people I spoke
to were developers and designers,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.860
generally people
 in the IT industry.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.700
I'd say out of 10 people
 that I spoke to,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.940
7 did not know
 about digital accessibility,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:17.060
and 2 out of 10 knows
a bit about digital accessibility,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.940
but it's not implemented
 at work at all.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.860
Only one person
that I spoke to actually knew a lot

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.780
about digital accessibility,
and the funny part is,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.460
the one person that knew a lot
about that was not even an IT engineer,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.260
a developer,
there was a student who was still in uni,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.100
and they had someone speak to them
about digital accessibility,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.300
so they decided to do more research on them.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.580
The government communication site
 in South Africa

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.340
also has a single page
on website accessibility,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.540
requesting all South African
 government departments

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.700
to address accessibility issues,
 but this is rarely followed.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.060
This is a missed opportunity,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.940
especially as South Africa
is a leading economy in Africa,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.260
with a rapidly growing tech industry,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.500
and the lack of digital accessibility
 standards in a country

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.340
that takes inclusion very important,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.260
and we call ourselves
the rainbow nation, South Africa,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.300
should be a wake-up call
for South African lawmakers.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.500
Another country to take a look at is Nigeria.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.300
In 2018, Nigeria passed discrimination
 against persons with disabilities,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.700
and it was a landmark piece
 of legislation aimed

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.820
at protecting the rights of people
with disabilities,

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.420
and the law provides
 for equal access to public services,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.740
education, healthcare, and employment,
but like many other African countries,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.020
it also lacks a clear mandate
when it comes to digital accessibility.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.180
There are no specific requirements
 for making websites,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.100
online government services,
or digital platforms accessible

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.340
to people with disabilities.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.700
This creates a significant barrier to inclusion,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.260
particularly for millions of Nigerians
 who rely on online banking,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:12.540
mobile apps, and in-government services
 for their day-to-day tasks.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.900
In a country as digitally connected as Nigeria,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.540
which is also the most
populated country in Africa

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:26.100
with about 220 million people,
 if I'm correct, this also means,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.820
by the way, that Nigeria has
 the highest number of people living

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.460
with disabilities in Africa.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.940
That means that people with disabilities

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.500
are left out of key services
 that are moving online,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.900
and that is a lot of people.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.620
While the physical infrastructure
 may be accessible,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.380
digital infrastructure
often remains out of reach.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.740
Bridging this gap in Nigeria
with technology is also growing rapidly.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.220
It is crucial for ensuring
 that no one is left behind.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.180
Another country I'm going
to take a look at quickly is Morocco.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.180
Morocco's law, 97-13,
 also guarantees the rights of people

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.620
with disabilities in public services,
infrastructure, and especially employment.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.140
They think that's very important,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.180
but like the ones I've mentioned,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.180
it does not address digital accessibility,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.580
and this is a concerning gap
as more public services

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.460
and critical information move online.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.580
From these three countries
 we've highlighted,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.540
we can see that the missing piece here
 is digital accessibility.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.500
Addressing this missing piece,
that is ensuring that digital platforms

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.420
are accessible will not only improve
the quality of life for millions,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.780
but also boost economic growth
 by including more people in the digital economy.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.100
Now countries like Kenya,
which has already introduced

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.340
its ICT accessibility standard,
are showing that it is possible,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.620
but the rest of the continent needs to follow.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.740
While digital accessibility is the missing piece
 in many African countries,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.020
Kenya has really proven
 that this gap can be filled

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.140
by developing the first national ICT standard,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.260
they have set the benchmark
for other African countries to follow.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.340
Let's take a look
at Kenya's ICT accessibility standard.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.060
As I mentioned,
Kenya is taking significant steps

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.980
towards addressing digital accessibility

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.340
by developing the ICT accessibility standard.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.060
I would say it is the first
 of its kind in Africa,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:44.540
and it's aligned with WCAG 2.1,
ensuring that digital platforms,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.100
including website and mobile apps,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.700
are accessible to people with disabilities.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.220
It is a landmark achievement
 because it applies

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.100
to both the public and private sectors.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.780
This means that not only government website,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.220
but also e-commerce platforms,
 online banking,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.500
and other digital services
must comply with these guidelines.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.780
By making this national standard,
Kenya has basically set an example

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.420
for the rest of Africa
 and they're demonstrating that digital inclusion

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.620
is possible when governments, businesses,
and advocacy groups work together

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.940
to create and enforce standards
that are for everyone, regardless of their abilities,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.900
assets, and benefits from digital platforms.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.140
I want to take a look at some
of the key features of Kenya's standards.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.820
The three main features
of Kenya's standard is web accessibility

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.340
and mobile application accessibility,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.460
and also the fact that it is compliant
for public and private sector.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.860
For example, the screen reader
compatibility that requires

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.060
that website and mobile applications
be compatible with screen readers.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.420
This is essential, you know?,
for visually impaired users.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.580
Also, keyboard navigation,
which is particularly important

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.300
for people with motor impairments
who may be unable to use the mouse.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.220
Website and applications really need

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.460
to be fully navigable using keyboard alone.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:37.060
From my research,
 I realized that especially in South Africa,

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:43.780
some websites,
 some people claim to have built platforms

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.900
that are accessible,
but one thing that is missing mostly

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.420
is keyboard navigation.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.180
I have tried to report this
 as much as I can,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.660
but it is a lot and it is something
 that needs to be taken

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.540
as a crucial point
 when discussing accessibility for platforms.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.020
Another is color contrast
and text readability,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.700
which mandates that they
 use appropriate color contrast

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.460
to ensure that text is readable,
even for people with low vision.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.020
This means ensuring sufficient contrast
 between text and background colors,

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.020
which makes content clearer
 and easier to read.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.780
Also, focusing
 on mobile application accessibility,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.780
the Kenya standard also focuses heavily
on the accessibility of mobile apps.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.220
With the rise
 of mobile use across Africa,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.780
it is important that apps
can be navigated by users

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.900
with assistive technologies,
such as voice commands,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.300
and that they integrate well
with screen readers and other assistive tools.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:54.020
Also, the most remarkable thing
about the Kenya standard

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.700
is that it applies across
 both public and private sectors.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.740
As I mentioned earlier,
 it means that not only government website,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.540
but also e-commerce, banking,
and healthcare platforms comply

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.860
with these accessibility guidelines,
 ensuring that digital services

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.180
are available to all.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.700
By ensuring these features,
Kenya is setting a stronger example

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.700
of how digital platforms
 can be made more inclusive in Africa.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.740
These standards ensure
that people with disability

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.060
can fully participate in the digital economy.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.420
Next, I'm going to take a look

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.500
at the impact of Kenya's ICT accessibility standard.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.500
All right, I'm going to take a look
 at how these standards came to be.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.300
The development
of Kenya's ICT standard,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.180
it was a collaborative effort driven by the need

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.460
to improve digital inclusivity
 for people with disabilities.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.620
It came about due to the growing
 recognition of barriers faced

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:03.460
by people with disability in accessing
 essential digital platforms and services.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.500
One of the major players
behind the development

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.300
of these standards
 was a non-profit organization called inABLE.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.420
They advocate for digital inclusion
 and empower the visually impaired

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.020
with assistive technologies.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.820
For over a decade,
inABLE has been actively working

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.140
to raise awareness about accessibility,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.740
especially digital accessibility
 for people with disabilities in Kenya.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.060
The organization then partnered
 with the Kenya Bureau of Standards,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.740
KEBS, to push for the adoption of a formalized

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.580
accessibility standard
 for ICT products and services.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:52.500
Another reason
was due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.460
These standards came to be
 as a response to the pandemic.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.220
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted
 the significant digital divide,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.620
especially for people with disabilities.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.500
During the pandemic,
a lot of services went online,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.180
such as government services,
education, healthcare,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.220
and e-commerce,
 and people with disabilities

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.740
were really affected
 by inaccessible platforms.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.500
This urgency was what helped drive
 the creation of the standard

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.620
in Kenya to ensure that digital services,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.420
both in public and private sectors,
are accessible to all.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.340
Also, the government
 and stakeholder collaboration,

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.020
Kenya Ministry of ICT
and the National Council of People

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.780
with Disabilities
were critical government bodies

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:48.380
that worked together with inABLE
and KEBS to develop the standard,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.740
so a broad range of stakeholders
from academia, industry, civil society,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.620
and also especially individuals
 with disabilities

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.780
were all involved to ensure
 the standard was comprehensive

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.620
and that it addresses
the real need of the population.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.740
The Kenya standard was also made to align

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.300
with the globally recognized
WCAG 2.1 guidelines,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.300
ensuring that website, mobile apps,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:23.180
and ICT products meet internationally
 accepted accessibility benchmarks.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.420
This alignment helps ensure
 that the standard is robust

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.980
and effective in creating
inclusive digital environment.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.500
Next, I'm going to take a look at the impact
 of Kenya's digital accessibility efforts.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.300
The five main impact
is that it has improved digital inclusion,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.780
educational access, economic empowerment,
setting a benchmark for Africa,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.020
and strengthened partnership.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.580
How has it improved digital inclusion?

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.260
The standard has directly enhanced access

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.940
to digital platforms
 for people with disabilities,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:05.020
so it's allowing them to participate more
 in the digital economy and society.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.820
As civil services like online banking,
e-commerce,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.020
and government platforms
are now more usable by people with disabilities,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.460
removing key barriers to participation.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.740
In education, schools and services
 have now started adopting the standard,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.340
making online learning platforms more accessible
to students with disabilities.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.900
If I might say, this is one of the main issues
 during the pandemic,

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.380
especially in South Africa,
when a lot of schools moved online,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.260
they found that many
of the online learning platforms

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.980
were not fully accessible
to people with disabilities.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.820
Kenya has made sure of this
with the standard,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.740
and this has led
 to greater educational opportunities,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.180
especially for visually impaired students

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.980
who now benefit from accessible resources.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.060
Another impact
 is economic empowerment.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.540
By making digital services accessible,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.460
including financial services
and employment platforms,

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.620
the standard has enabled
greater economic participation

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.980
for people with disabilities.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.580
This has also boosted
 employment opportunities

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:20.700
and allowed people with disabilities
 to engage in online commerce

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.660
and other economic activities.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.380
It has also set a benchmark
 for Africa, as I mentioned.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.780
Kenya's standard serves
as a model for other African nations,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:37.060
showing that comprehensive
 digital accessibility can be achieved in Africa.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.820
Other countries are beginning to consider,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.500
though not a lot
and not as much as they should,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.300
but other countries are starting
to look at what Kenya has done,

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.580
and they're beginning
 to consider setting similar standards

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.580
to ensure that their digital platforms
 are accessible.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.620
Lastly, it has strengthened partnerships,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.660
the collaboration between government bodies,
private sector companies,

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.140
advocacy groups like inABLE
 and people with disabilities

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:13.420
has created a strong network
 for promoting digital accessibility.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:19.180
These partnerships have currently been
 in the government implementation

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.340
of accessibility standards
 across sectors in Kenya.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:28.780
That's about Kenya,
but what are the general challenges

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.060
in digital accessibility across Africa?

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.060
I have listed four here,
but there are more.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.820
To me, these are the four main challenges

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.980
in implementing digital accessibility in Africa.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.260
First is our awareness
and enforcement.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.260
A significant challenge
is definitely lack of awareness

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.100
about accessibility standards.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:25:00.140
As I mentioned that I spoke
 to a few people in the IT industry

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.340
who do not know about digital accessibility.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.420
Many organizations,
especially smaller ones,

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.420
may not even be aware of existing guidelines
 like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.340
Even where standards do exist,
enforcement is often inconsistent.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.420
Government bodies and regulators
 are not always ensure compliance,

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:28.260
meaning that many websites
 and digital services remain inaccessible

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.300
to users with disability.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.380
A good example of this
 is the inconsistent enforcement

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.220
of the South Africa's White Paper
 on the Rights of Persons with Disability.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.820
This lack of awareness brings us
 to the next challenge, which is related to cost.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.900
Accessibility improvements
 often require significant investment,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.700
but in terms of finances and time.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.860
Smaller organizations and startups,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.780
the cost of implementing accessibility features

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.820
such as upgrading a website
for screen reader compatibility

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.980
or ensuring proper color contrast
 can be prohibited.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:13.420
This leads to a situation
where the cost becomes a barrier to accessibility.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.780
Larger organizations,
however, with more resources,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.740
might be able to bear these costs,
but for smaller entities, it can be a bit harder.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.980
Even if the cost is not a barrier,
 there's two technology challenges to consider.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:36.060
In many parts of Africa, we face low
 internet penetration and outdated technology,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.060
particularly in rural areas,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.380
and this limits the rollout
of digital accessibility features

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.420
as many of these require
 modern infrastructure

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.940
and reliable internet connectivity.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.540
This digital divide,
especially in rural areas,

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.900
further worsens the challenge
 as people with disabilities

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.620
in these regions may even have
less access to accessible platforms.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.980
Finally, let's not forget
 the challenge around expertise.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.020
Another key challenge
is the lack of expertise and the difficulty

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.380
of conforming to standards.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.420
Many developers
 and ICT professionals are not trained

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.060
in accessibility best practices.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.100
Again, from my interview
 with people where developers

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.340
and designers do not know
about digital accessibility.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.660
Even when organizations want
to implement these features,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.580
they may not have
 the expertise to do so,

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.980
which leads to partial
or ineffective implementations.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.300
One thing that I see happen a lot

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.620
is the ineffective implementation
of accessibility.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:52.980
Some people know about accessibility,
but how do I implement it?

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.060
When do I implement it?

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.940
The common mistake
 about accessibility from my research

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.180
is when do you implement accessibility?

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.900
Because it seems a lot of people
 only think about accessibility for a website,

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.860
for example, when they're downloading [?] website,
they're staying in SEO,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.540
and they've not launched the website.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.100
That is when they think about accessibility,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.900
which leads to ineffective implementation.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.860
Furthermore, as we have realized,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.220
enforcement of conformance remains a challenge,

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.380
which means that even when standards exist,
 not everyone is part of it.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.220
As you can see,
addressing these challenges

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.340
requires a complex approach,
 which is raising awareness,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.260
reducing costs, improving infrastructure,
and providing the necessary training.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.460
With these challenges
also comes some opportunities.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:54.780
What are the opportunities for Africa
in the field of digital accessibility?

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.900
First, I would say Kenya's accessibility standard

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.180
has provided a solid foundation
for other African nations to follow.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.460
By adopting Kenya's standard as a model,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.180
other countries can save
 both time and resources.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.140
They don't need to reinvent the world.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.740
They don't need to start from scratch

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.060
since when there is a country in Africa
 that already has a standard,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.580
a country standard, they can build
on Kenya's proven framework

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.380
to create their own national
 accessibility standard

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.540
and this would create
 consistency across the continent

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.820
where African countries build
on one standard.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.180
Second is we also have the opportunity
 to strengthen legal frameworks.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:56.140
African countries can integrate
 the WCAG as Kenya has done

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.100
into their national disability laws,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.140
ensuring digital accessibility
 becomes a legal requirement

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.900
and also introducing incentives
and penalties for compliance.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.900
This is important.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.300
This will encourage public
 and private sectors

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.780
to adopt accessible practices
in the digital platforms

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.740
such as website and mobile apps.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:22.660
These steps will pave the way for
 a more inclusive future where all users,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:28.380
including persons with disabilities,
can benefit from digital revolution.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.820
Moving on is collaborative solutions.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.180
One of the key steps forward
 in addressing digital accessibility

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.220
is collaboration.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.980
As we've seen
in the case of Kenya,

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.300
this involves public-private partnerships,
government, businesses,

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.900
and advocacy groups
coming together to ensure

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.580
that private sector websites
and apps are made accessible to everyone.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.260
As I mentioned, an example
 is a collaboration between Kenya's government

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.780
and industries like banking,
 telecommunications, and advocacy groups.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:15.340
This was crucial in implementing
 the ICT accessibility standard.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.340
Training is another collaborative solution.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.540
Governments and NGOs
must invest in training developers

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.020
and ICT professionals
 in digital accessibility standards.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.340
This is vital for
 the long-term sustainability

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.380
of accessibility initiatives
 and will help future projects

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.420
to ensure that they serve all members of society.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.180
One thing that happens a lot in Africa,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.500
and I think a lot of people probably
 agree to this in Africa,

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:53.540
is the lack of training when the government
 tries to implement standards like this.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.420
As I mentioned earlier, South Africa
has this webpage on website accessibility,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.700
but it has not been adhered to.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.780
No one follows it.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.900
There is no training,
there is no organization

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:15.660
by the government that asks
for that, that actually tries

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.780
to enforce this.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.180
No training,
it's just a standard that's there,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.980
but no one follows it,
and nothing has been done to improve it.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.460
Moving on
to future directions for Africa.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.020
Where do we go from here?

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.860
We can say now that Africa
 has the real opportunity

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.300
to move forward in the future
of digital accessibility,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.660
and one of the ways to do this is

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.860
by expanding digital accessibility initiatives
 across the continent.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.020
First, the African Union
 has a critical role to play.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.620
I'm not sure if anyone
 from the African Union will listen to this,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.420
but I hope to do that
 with my research.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.780
I hope to interview
a lot of people and to try

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.100
to get my research as far as it can go.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.860
As I said, African Union
has a critical role to play,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.500
so by encouraging regional cooperation

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.060
and promoting standardized
digital accessibility regulations.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.100
If this is a standard set
by the African Union,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:26.660
then it is easier to make it reach
 every African country

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.020
so we can ensure that every country
 moves forward together

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.060
and not just in pockets of progress.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.860
Now that Kenya has set one,
then South Africa does it,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.060
and then Nigeria,
it's just pockets of progress.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.620
If the African Union is involved in this

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.260
and it's a standard set by African Union,

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.580
just like the EU has,
then we all move forward together.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.700
This will create a unified standard,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.820
making digital services accessible
 across national boundaries.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:07.220
Second is national ICT development plans
 should also prioritize accessibility.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.740
We need to ensure that people with disabilities

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.540
are included in the plans
 that shape Africa's digital future

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:19.140
by embedding digital accessibility
 in our national strategies

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.740
so we not only foster inclusivity,
 but also bridge the digital divide

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:30.340
and creating opportunities
for all citizens to benefit from technology.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.980
It's my conclusion.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.420
At this point,
I think we all now know the importance

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.100
of taking action
and we know that digital accessibility

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.340
is not just a recommendation,
but it needs to be made a priority.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.860
As we've seen, many African nations

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.100
still lack comprehensive
 digital accessibility laws,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.780
which has created a gap
 where people with disabilities are excluded

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.220
from vital services and information.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.540
How do we close this gap?

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:07.220
By prioritizing digital accessibility
in both law and practice,

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.220
just like Kenya has done
with its ICT standard.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.460
We need similar frameworks
 to be adopted across the continent

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.740
to ensure that no one is left behind.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.820
It's time to turn words into action
and that starts with everyone,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.620
each of us advocating
for the changes we want to see.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:32.020
For example, what I'm trying
 to achieve with my research

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:39.380
is to get it to reach as many
disability advocacy groups in Africa

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.540
as much as I can.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.900
They have a lot to reach,

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.180
but my goal is to make sure
my research actually reaches them.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.940
I think I've reached out
 to three or four in South Africa.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.140
I have spoken to them
 and they were really excited

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.780
about my research
and really willing to collaborate.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.380
I hope I will be able to reach
others outside of South Africa

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.300
and I hope we will see
a way forward from there.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.940
Also, it's not just
 the responsibility of governments,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.700
it is a collective effort
 that includes developers, businesses,

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.900
and advocacy groups.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.860
We all need to collaborate
to make sure that websites, mobile apps,

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.660
and other digital services
are accessible to all users,

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.460
regardless of their disabilities.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.500
By working together, we can create
a more inclusive digital future

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.620
for people with disabilities across Africa.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.060
Government can break laws,
developers also have to ensure compliance,

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.700
and advocacy groups can push
for implementation and awareness.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.740
Thank you for your time
 and attention today.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.380
I hope this talk has informed you
and also inspired you

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.420
to take action on digital access in Africa.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.380
If you have questions, please feel free
to reach out to me via email on my website.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.900
I would really appreciate
some input on my research.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.900
Thank you.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.580
-Thank you so much, Femi Taiwo,
 for an amazing session.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:22.340
I just want to remind our listeners
 that they can ask questions in the Q&amp;A session.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.020
We do have a question right now from John.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:38.500
John says, "Coming from a country
 that lacks enforcing digital accessibility,

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:45.980
how can an individual or my company
 help to push this initiative forward?"

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:56.860
<v Femi> I think the first thing
 is to learn more about accessibility standards.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:02.380
There is the WCAG 2.1,
which is a global standard.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.940
I think that's the first step,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.420
learning and also introducing
that in the company.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.620
To push the initiative forward,

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.340
as I mentioned,
 I think one of the best ways

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.980
is reaching out to advocacy groups.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.580
I'm not sure
what country you're from,

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.060
but reaching out
to advocacy groups and working

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.940
with advocacy groups and also
spreading awareness, just like I'm doing now.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.340
I think spreading awareness
 is very important.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.660
Spreading awareness
 is the first thing to do

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.220
to actually push this forward
 and also reaching out

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.300
to advocacy groups to work with them.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.660
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you so much, Femi.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.660
We have another amazing
question from Manto.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.940
And Manto says, "As someone
 who has started an initiative

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.820
to empower persons
with disabilities in Africa,

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.580
specifically Cameroon,
what advice can you give to me

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.500
on how to support or how
to get support from the continent?"

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.260
<v Femi> Great.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.740
I have also thought about this
 as I'm working on my research.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.260
How do I get support from the country?

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.220
As I mentioned, I have,
I reached out to some advocacy groups.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.980
There is the WCAPD,
 it's the Western Cape Association for People

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.020
with Disabilities,
and they have been very supportive

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:32.540
because they are NGOs
that are more connected to the government.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.940
They have been very supportive
 and they have really tried

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.220
to give me as more information
 that I need for my research

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:49.820
and they are willing to help
in pushing this case forward in the country.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.060
I would say one of the ways to get support
 is also reaching out to advocacy groups.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.980
You say you're from Cameroon.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.860
I haven't really checked
on advocacy groups in Cameroon,

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.820
but I am sure there are groups
 that you can work with in Cameroon.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you so much, Femi.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.740
We have another question from Gerson.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.540
They say, "What's the general feedback
and reception of businesses

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.180
and websites owners in Kenya
regarding digital accessibility?

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.460
Is it well-received and implemented
 or is there resistance?"

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.820
<v Femi> Yes, it is well-received.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.740
There is some resistance,
 as there will also be.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:44.020
As in the United States and in Europe,
it is a standard and it is a law.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.700
It is something you have to follow
or you will be penalised in some way.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:58.820
Even for those who do not want
to follow, it is very important.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.620
Also, as I mentioned,

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.260
that one of the reasons
 why this was pushed

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.940
was due to the COVID-19 pandemic

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.820
and a lot of people
 actually could see a genuine

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.900
and a good reason
 for implementing this standard.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.700
Also, with the fact that--
I think someone else talked about this,

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.380
I've also talked about this in my previous talk,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.060
is if there are standards
and laws like this

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.700
and you are not following them,

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.780
you are basically not reaching people
with disabilities.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.140
If you are a business, maybe you sell online

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.100
and you are not implementing the standard,

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.660
it means you are not reaching
 about 15% of your customers.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.700
So I think these are the things
 that people actually get

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.220
to think about and then we have
 to follow the standard.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.580
<v Yigakpoa> Okay, thank you so much, Femi.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.780
You have another question from Willem.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:14.220
It says, "In your research,
have you found any information

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.100
about accessibility initiatives
or regulations in Nigeria?

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.020
With Nigeria being the most
 populous country on the continent,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.860
it seems that initiatives here
 could have a lot of impact."

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.300
He says, "Apologies
if I already missed it."

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.060
<v Femi> Yes, I did mention this,
but I'll go by it again.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.260
There are accessibility
 initiatives in Nigeria,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.580
but what I mentioned
is the fact that the standards

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.900
and laws in Nigeria
do not really focus on digital accessibility.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:52.740
I am also planning to reach out
 to initiatives in Nigeria with my research.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.500
As you mentioned,
with Nigeria being the most populous country,

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.060
this is very important because Nigeria

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.140
also has the highest number
of people living with disability in Africa.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you again, Femi.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.660
I think I have a personal question,

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.860
but I can't seem to ask it
in the chat, so I'll just ask.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.420
My question is,
 what role can open-source technology play

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.260
in advancing digital accessibility in Africa?

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Femi> Yes, I would say the role
that open-source technology

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.700
can play is what we're doing now,
is what WordPress

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.940
is doing in the IT industry.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.500
What I've also tried to do
 is try to speak at events.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:55.660
In South Africa, there is an event
 that we have, it's called Do Action.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.460
I'm not sure if you know about it.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.180
It is an event
where we build websites for NGOs.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.140
My plan, hopefully,
for next year is if we're going to have one again,

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.700
we're going to focus mainly
on accessibility,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.940
that is look for NGO websites
that lack accessibility features

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.140
and we build a website just for that.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.980
I think these are one of the ways
that open-source communities can assist.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.540
<v Yigakpoa> That's a great, great, great idea.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.460
Thank you so much again, Femi Taiwo,

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.220

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.140

and standards

in Nigeria-- in Africa, sorry.
