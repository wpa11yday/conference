00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.595
<v Announcer> WordPress Accessibility Day 2024

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.357
Is your page builder actually accessible?

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:10.586
with speaker Scarlett Isbell,
web developer at Orbit Media Studios.

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:14.487
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:20.087
<v Simon Miner> Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:24.842
My name is Simon Miner,
and I'm the founder and CEO of Pedal Point Solutions.

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:26.746
If I'm looking away
from you right now,

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:28.226
it's not that I'm being rude.

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:32.909
I just have a low vision
and a big monitor with large text in front of me.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:39.240
It's my pleasure to welcome you here
and thank you for joining us

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:43.106
for this session entitled,
Is Your Page Builder Actually Accessible,

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:44.724
with Scarlett Isbell.

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:46.477
A little bit about Scarlett.

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:51.276
Scarlett has been developing
WordPress sites for over a decade now,

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.165
spending most of that time
working on page builders

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.364
and finding their strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:02.975
She is currently
a web developer for Orbit Media,

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:08.536
where she is an accessibility advocate
and the resident Elementor aficionado.

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:13.837
Every day, she collaborates
with others to learn, improve,

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:18.721
and explore new ways to make
the web and the whole world, in fact,

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.452
a more inclusive space.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:26.617
From being the lead organizer
of WordCamp Fayetteville

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:31.869
to hosting WordPress meetups
for the Springfield, Missouri community,

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:36.380
Scarlett believes that everybody
should feel supported

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:41.807
and encouraged
on their journey to make the web better

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:43.432
and more accessible to everyone.

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:44.790
Just a note.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:49.139
Please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.773
and we'll answer them
at the end of the presentation,

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:57.812
and use the chat feature
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:01.121
And with that,
I want to turn it over to Scarlett.

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:02.386
So, please take it away.

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:03.977
<v Scarlett Isbell> Awesome.

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:08.120
Thank you so much, Simon,
for that glowing introduction here.

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:12.376
This is actually my first time
presenting at a conference,

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.034
and what a better way to kick it off
than WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.113
I am so excited to be here.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.688
Thank you for everyone
who is attending.

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:26.704
Today I am going
to take you on the guided tour

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.927
through page builder accessibility.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:35.542
I will be your tour guide for today.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:39.216
With Simon's introduction,
I don't really need to tell you much more.

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:42.391
I have added the link to my LinkedIn.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.856
Look me up, connect with me.

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.633
Along our guide today,
please keep your arms, legs, hands,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:54.329
and personal belongings
within the Zoom call at all times.

00:02:54.354 --> 00:02:56.057
Let's get rolling.

00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.921
First off, we're going to start with,
why use a page builder?

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:07.236
Page builders
are really geared towards beginners,

00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.974
and they're really easy
to use and an easy way

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.371
to add functionality to your website

00:03:13.664 --> 00:03:16.202
without requiring
a lot of custom coding.

00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:19.416
However,
this also comes with drawbacks

00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:23.773
because a lot of them--
In fact, spoiler alert,

00:03:23.798 --> 00:03:27.969
I haven't found
a page builder that is fully accessible.

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:30.089
I don't believe
that there is one out there.

00:03:30.114 --> 00:03:32.706
I think it comes
with the nature of the beast

00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:35.151
that we're going to learn to wrangle today.

00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:40.951
But knowing those tools,
they can be helpful,

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:44.158
and we can choose
what choices to make.

00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:49.248
That takes us into the next thing
we need to cover,

00:03:49.273 --> 00:03:51.281
which is user responsibility.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:57.248
Choosing to use a page builder comes
with a lot of responsibility on us,

00:03:57.273 --> 00:04:04.516
the user, the people building these sites,
to choose the best widgets,

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.135
the best modules, the best things

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.191
to make our site
the most inclusive they can be.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.626
Page builders include
a lot of features

00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.545
and things that might look fun,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.291
but there's an underlying surface there

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:22.866
that's just not accessible or easy to use.

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:27.921
Remember that just because
a feature is popular within a page builder,

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:32.772
or all page builders for that matter,
doesn't mean that it's inclusive.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.993
Part of the user responsibility
is also ensuring

00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:42.524
that we are doing our proper testing,
so testing on screen readers,

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:49.579
assistive technology devices,
keyboards, doing manual testing.

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:54.226
I love tools
such as Wave and Siteimprove

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:59.927
to help get an overall view
of how our website accessibility is doing,

00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.870
but ensuring that we're doing
our manual testing just can't be beat.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:08.251
Because we're users.

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:10.839
We're not computers in this space.

00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:15.973
The first section along
our journey today

00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:19.524
is going to be our page
builder success checklist.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.467
Whether you have a page builder
that you've been using for a while,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.371
or you're looking
to just get started with one,

00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:30.570
these are the features
to keep an eye on

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:35.106
that can give a good indication
of whether your page builder

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:40.503
is even considering accessibility
in the way that they build things,

00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:44.751
and some do this a little bit
better than others.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:51.091
There will be four items
in our checklist to get started,

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.066
and let's get going.

00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:56.559
Our first one is a skip
to content link.

00:05:57.234 --> 00:05:59.963
While this is a simple feature,

00:05:59.988 --> 00:06:03.368
it is often overlooked
by page builders.

00:06:03.393 --> 00:06:05.947
When it would be easy to add it in,

00:06:05.972 --> 00:06:10.729
or at least add a toggle
to where you can turn it on or off,

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:13.587
please leave the toggle on.

00:06:13.612 --> 00:06:16.906
It is, unfortunately, forgotten.

00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:23.118
A skip to content link
allows a user to be able to

00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:25.158
skip over your navigation

00:06:25.183 --> 00:06:27.713
once they tab into the body of the site,

00:06:27.738 --> 00:06:31.388
and then that way they can get
to the main content.

00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:36.400
As you can imagine,
if you had a big old navigation

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:40.195
that a user is trying
to navigate through your site

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.036
on a keyboard
or assistive technology,

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:47.106
they might get frustrated
and even leave

00:06:47.131 --> 00:06:48.331
and not want to deal with it

00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:52.363
if they can't get to the reason
why they're there.

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:56.308
If this is something
that your page builder is missing,

00:06:56.333 --> 00:07:00.221
it can be easily added
using some custom code.

00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:03.365
I've found that a quick Google search

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:09.144
will give a good amount of resources
for your specific page builder.

00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:15.817
Here's an example of what a skip
to content link would look like.

00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:20.746
Shout-out to the website
for our event today.

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:22.861
It may look familiar.

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:28.803
Again, whenever a user tabs
into the body of your site,

00:07:28.828 --> 00:07:30.361
this is what they will see.

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.097
Along with that,

00:07:32.122 --> 00:07:38.643
just ensuring that this skip to
content link has a good target size on it

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.016
so it's big enough to click,

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:47.196
and it has a good contrast ratio
so the user can easily tell what it says.

00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:54.986
Moving on into our next checklist items
is our focus outlines.

00:07:55.011 --> 00:08:00.916
Ensuring that items
on our site have proper outlines

00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:05.952
is very important for letting users
that may be on keyboards

00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:09.492
or assistive technologies
know where they're at on the site.

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:15.524
It's, again, another simple feature that,
for some reason,

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:17.257
page builders don't bake in.

00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:22.952
It is an easy enough one
to add using CSS.

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:27.256
Let's take a look
at a better example

00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:30.129
of what a good focus outline
might look like.

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:34.595
So, I have two images
on the screen here.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.856
On the top one,
we have three items within a navigation,

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:44.416
and the second item
is highlighted using a focus outline.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:50.096
The user can easily tell that
that's where they are on the site.

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:52.921
They can easily see it.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.416
Then the bottom one;
if a user was navigating via keyboard

00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:00.956
or assistive technology,
they wouldn't know-

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:05.416
they wouldn't be able to tell
that they were on the sponsors link

00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:07.841
or maybe anywhere on the page.

00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:12.041
They would be completely lost,
and this is not great.

00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.823
Along with that,
ensuring that your focus outlines

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.415
are also of a good contrast.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.704
I know a lot of websites,
they have light and dark sections.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:32.262
Ensuring that your focus outline
is always a high-contrast color

00:09:32.287 --> 00:09:34.247
is always the way to go.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:40.304
I love a good dual-color approach,
so ensuring an outline

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:44.338
that has maybe both dark
and light colors so that way,

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:47.041
regardless of the background, 
it's always visible.

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:51.004
Then also making sure
that it's a good thickness.

00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:56.998
I believe that two pixels is the
recommended thickness for a focus outline.

00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:04.881
As we move along our journey here,
we move into a biggie;

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:07.401
the proper landmark usage.

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:13.695
Ensuring that different landmarks are
being properly identified upon our site.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:21.484
For example--
Excuse my rough Photoshop skills here.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:24.601
It's tougher to find an illustration
of this than you would believe.

00:10:24.952 --> 00:10:29.410
Here is the general,
very simplified version

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:32.609
of the way the site landmark might look.

00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:38.447
You have your header landmark, and
nested inside that you have a nav landmark.

00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:42.297
Then below that 
we have our main, our footer,

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:47.839
and another nav element nested
within our footer.

00:10:47.864 --> 00:10:55.515
Your page builder should allow you
to easily specify these things

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.076
if they don't already have them specified.

00:10:58.902 --> 00:11:01.870
Otherwise,
this can be done using custom code,

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:05.702
but it definitely makes it
a little bit tougher.

00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:11.336
These landmarks ensure that a user
can tell where they are at on a site.

00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:13.961
If you wouldn't be able to see the site,

00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:17.723
you're navigating via assistive technology,
a screen reader,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.736
it will read these elements aloud,

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:25.405
and they can even jump to the elements
that they would like to know more about.

00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:34.259
For example, this,
I've taken a screenshot from Elementor.

00:11:34.284 --> 00:11:37.949
What we're seeing here
is Elementor is allowing us

00:11:37.974 --> 00:11:44.921
to adjust the HTML tag to indicate
what landmark we would like this to be.

00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:49.318
In this example,
we have the selected header,

00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:54.255
but it gives you the flexibility
to select whatever landmark

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.481
is best for where you need it to be,

00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:01.571
and ensuring that those
are being used accurately.

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:05.942
Another thing
that's essential is to ensure

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:09.091
that these are used
consistently across your site,

00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:15.376
and if you are building websites
for a client or somebody else to use,

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:23.384
that they are educated
on how to also use landmarks properly,

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:27.064
or ensure that the website
is set up in such a way

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:31.477
that they don't really have
to worry about it too, too much.

00:12:32.263 --> 00:12:36.841
Another thing that's important
about these is ensuring

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:39.380
that everything is properly labeled.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:46.917
Going back to our example here
of the setup is within the header,

00:12:46.942 --> 00:12:49.121
we see we have one nav element.

00:12:49.146 --> 00:12:54.185
Let's say we had a nav element
for the primary navigation,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.169
but within the header we also had
a second one for a secondary navigation.

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.962
Without it being properly labeled
with an ARIA label,

00:13:02.987 --> 00:13:06.375
that could get confusing for a user.

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:12.955
That brings us
into our last and final checklist item,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.550
which is a custom
attribute support.

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:23.230
Custom attributes,
within page builders and in general,

00:13:23.516 --> 00:13:28.457
allow you to be able
to add those different ARIA labels

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:30.982
to these sections of your website.

00:13:31.007 --> 00:13:34.179
Whenever a user is going through,

00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:37.096
it will read out
that it's a primary navigation

00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.296
versus a secondary navigation,

00:13:39.908 --> 00:13:44.816
or it can help clarify phone numbers
that might get jumbled on screen readers.

00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:50.612
Anything to make it clearer
and help reduce frustration for a user,

00:13:50.641 --> 00:13:55.565
just make it an easier world
to navigate the web in.

00:13:56.321 --> 00:14:03.216
These attributes can also
be added using code, JavaScript,

00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:08.093
and stuff like that, if the page builder
doesn't make it easy for you.

00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:12.441
I know that there's a few out there
that are supporting custom attribute support.

00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:17.001
I believe Elementor, Divi,
and maybe Visual Composer.

00:14:17.026 --> 00:14:19.601
I don't know.
That's not a complete list.

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:23.241
Don't hold me to it,
but it kind of gives you a general guide.

00:14:25.033 --> 00:14:28.551
Here's a few ARIA attribute examples.

00:14:28.948 --> 00:14:30.016
Like I said, a few.

00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:33.305
There's many more,
but these are more of the common ones

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.826
of the aria-label, aria-role,
aria-live, and aria-hidden.

00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.456
One thing to watch out
for on page builders

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:47.561
is I've found that a lot do love
that aria-hidden for some reason.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:51.976
That means that if aria-hidden
is added to an element,

00:14:52.001 --> 00:15:00.336
a user will not be able to read that item
with their assistive technology,

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:03.655
therefore not even knowing that it's there.

00:15:03.688 --> 00:15:07.389
While this item is good
in strategic places,

00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:11.976
I've found it on things
in page builders such as social icons

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.888
that seem pretty essential.

00:15:17.404 --> 00:15:21.877
For some reason,
page builders just love those items.

00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:25.924
Here's an example
within the Elementor editor.

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:31.213
We have a screenshot here
within the custom attributes section,

00:15:31.656 --> 00:15:35.056
and here I've written out the ARIA label,

00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:39.801
and then it has a pipe
where we add the primary nav label to it.

00:15:40.213 --> 00:15:44.435
Then it will add that
ARIA label to that item

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.872
to make it a little bit easier
for you without custom coding.

00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:54.906
I'm sure that the format of this looks
different across all page builders,

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:59.136
so read the-- read the documentation
for your page builder

00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:02.342
and find out what is right for you.

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:05.192
All right.

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:11.840
We're on to the next section
in our tour today, and it's a big one.

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:13.495
It's our red flag list.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.080
First, I'm going to take
a hydration break real quick.

00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.801
[silence]

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:22.296
All right.

00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:26.696
Our red flag list are items
to keep in mind.

00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:29.443
These are accessibility pitfalls.

00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:33.144
Usually, these items
within page builders are not accessible,

00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:36.216
so we need to keep
a very close eye on them,

00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:39.771
and in some cases,
we'll avoid them completely.

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:41.835
Don't worry, though.

00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:49.029
I'll offer some good, more accessible
alternatives to those items as well.

00:16:50.599 --> 00:16:57.314
Bringing us in strong, waving us in with
that red flag are interactive elements.

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:02.736
These are items such as flip boxes,
interactive circles, flip carousels.

00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:05.601
I mean, honestly, anything that says flip

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:08.601
or interactive within
a page builder, I just say-

00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:10.081
[chuckles] I usually nope out of.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:18.401
These kinds of items like
to take valuable content and hide them

00:17:18.426 --> 00:17:22.336
from the user or force them
to interact with it

00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:24.256
in order to be able to see it.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.209
This could be in the form
of a hover or a focus

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:33.353
that the user has to perform
in order to see this content

00:17:33.378 --> 00:17:36.869
because it's hidden behind
a box or an element.

00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:43.900
These are definitely
an avoid completely in my list.

00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:48.756
They are excluding users,
and they're just plain bad.

00:17:49.614 --> 00:17:53.976
Here I have a screenshot here
demonstrating some examples.

00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:59.161
I wasn't going to subject you
to all that motion and craziness today,

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.903
so screenshots it is.

00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:06.600
I've gotten this screenshot
from the Elementor website,

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.885
and we see three cards.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:15.496
The first one, we can see
is flipping over from side to side.

00:18:15.902 --> 00:18:18.816
Then the second one
is currently being hovered,

00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.868
where we can see that some
of the content is being pushed up

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.367
and new content is being displayed.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:29.848
Then the second one, we just
see that it has an icon with a title.

00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:33.109
Where to begin on these?

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:40.655
For one, we have problematic animations
that whenever the user interacts with it,

00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:46.758
they get bombarded with an experience
that they likely didn't sign up for.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.869
Then we're also hiding
a valuable content underneath this.

00:18:54.894 --> 00:18:58.217
When a user is scanning
through the site,

00:18:58.242 --> 00:19:01.056
these cards aren't clearly clickable.

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:05.637
There's no indicator
that the user needs to take an action.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:10.296
This content is being hidden
from so many users

00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:12.660
that they're not going to be able to see

00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:20.635
or get to know what you're trying
to promote for them, and it's frustrating.

00:19:21.007 --> 00:19:25.456
Not to mention users with motion sensitivity
and different things like that.

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:32.896
My recommendation for items like these 
is to just go with a static card.

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:36.046
It is fine to put it all out on the table

00:19:36.371 --> 00:19:38.936
and show your users all of the content,

00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:42.591
so having that icon
at the top, the title.

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:46.630
Then let's put just the
content underneath it

00:19:46.655 --> 00:19:48.352
so that way, the user can see it.

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:53.169
If that card is meant to be clickable,
please add an indicator.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:00.309
We just keep on waving
with the animated items.

00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:04.896
This one has to be one
of my least favorites

00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:09.706
on my red flag list
is the animated titles.

00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:14.668
For some reason,
page builders love these,

00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:16.955
and I will never figure out the reason why.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.081
These animated titles are problematic
because they're always changing text.

00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:25.256
There's a constant animation.

00:20:25.281 --> 00:20:30.056
They don't allow the user
to pause or play the animations.

00:20:30.413 --> 00:20:32.256
It's just [mimics aversion].

00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:35.486
If you need a title or a headline,

00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:40.106
please just use a properly
marked up headline.

00:20:40.131 --> 00:20:42.212
That is perfectly okay.

00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:45.136
Here's an example.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:49.111
Again, I wasn't going
to subject you guys to all that movement

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:54.056
and everything going on, 
but here's a screenshot of an animated title.

00:20:54.081 --> 00:20:58.481
On the screen,
we see there's just some filler content

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:00.838
that's flowing off
of the page.

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:04.391
As I was sitting on the page,
a new word popped in

00:21:04.733 --> 00:21:07.871
and then it went out again
and then another word popped in.

00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:09.843
Confusing.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:13.891
You don't know what message
they're trying to get across to you

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:17.570
because the content is always changing.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:23.589
It's bad for users
with motion sensitivity.

00:21:24.344 --> 00:21:28.073
It's tough for anyone
to really keep up with.

00:21:28.098 --> 00:21:29.660
Let's avoid these.

00:21:29.685 --> 00:21:33.993
Let's put these on the page builder
no-no list if we could.

00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:41.389
The animations
just keep on going with these red flags.

00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:46.401
Another popular thing
that we see on page builders a lot

00:21:46.426 --> 00:21:52.496
is that they'll give you the option
for extra effects and animations,

00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:58.056
such entrance animations and scrolling
animations and different things like that.

00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:05.151
While these aren't always the worst,
they're not the best either.

00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:09.626
They can be used
within a certain realm.

00:22:09.944 --> 00:22:13.473
One thing to note
that I've recently found out

00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:19.256
was that a lot of page builders;
there's a setting within users' browsers

00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:21.216
that they can reduce motion,

00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:26.536
and it's supposed to turn off
the entrance animations and different things.

00:22:26.884 --> 00:22:30.325
and there's page builders out there
that are ignoring this,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.503
which— I mean,
can we say problematic?

00:22:34.628 --> 00:22:39.401
There is some custom code
that you might be able

00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:42.081
to add in there to ensure
that your page builder

00:22:42.201 --> 00:22:44.696
is listening to your users.

00:22:44.721 --> 00:22:49.561
Just ensure you're doing your testing
and everything is looking good.

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:53.056
This is one of those proceed
with great caution

00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:56.799
and ensure
that everything works properly.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.456
Here's an example that I found
on the Elementor website.

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.225
I guess a big call-out here,
don't come for me,

00:23:05.693 --> 00:23:10.417
but they're using
a scrolling effect to have--

00:23:10.521 --> 00:23:14.655
and they have all these
little cards on top of this headline.

00:23:15.023 --> 00:23:21.383
Then as you scroll, the cards dissipate
and you can then read the headline.

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:25.721
One, why are we covering up
the headline in the first place?

00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:31.299
We're making this a little too difficult
for users to read and interact with.

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:33.456
There's all these cards.

00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:35.457
Are they clickable?

00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:37.100
Am I supposed to do something with it?

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:37.921
I don't know.

00:23:37.946 --> 00:23:40.732
There's too much.

00:23:40.757 --> 00:23:44.170
It's items like these
that we just need—

00:23:44.916 --> 00:23:48.289
let's toss those out of our options.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:58.697
Then we're moving, waving in
with our sliders and our carousels.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:06.125
Again, we're forcing user interaction
to be able to view our content.

00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:09.418
Sliders,
unless they're marked up properly,

00:24:09.696 --> 00:24:13.070
don't always work
with assistive technology.

00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:16.575
Usually, within a page builder,
might be a shocker,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.640
but they're not always
marked up properly.

00:24:20.171 --> 00:24:25.735
These are one of the things
that I do recommend avoiding where you can,

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.296
where it is possible.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.856
The W3C does give us an example

00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:35.216
of what a properly marked up
slider does look like,

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:40.881
so you at least have that
to go on should you have any questions

00:24:40.906 --> 00:24:44.281
or should you really want
a slider for your website.

00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:46.041
There are ways to make it accessible,

00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:50.097
but I'm never a fan
for hiding content from users.

00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:58.476
Here's an example of a slider
that I saw on the Beaver Builder website.

00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:07.705
We see a screenshot of a slider
that has a kitty and a dog playing,

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:11.984
with an overlay in the center
that has some text and a button.

00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:19.403
Would you believe me if I said
that there's also navigation arrows on this slider?

00:25:20.096 --> 00:25:21.958
No, really, there are.

00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:26.554
I just put circles around them on the screen.

00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:30.464
This is also why if you're going to use a slider,

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:36.148
ensuring proper contrast is essential for users.

00:25:37.728 --> 00:25:40.281
Most users
would just come here, see this

00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:46.098
and just assume
that it's an image and go on with their way.

00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:48.152
If this is really important content,

00:25:48.221 --> 00:25:53.101
let's put it front
and center for users to find.

00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:58.191
Another thing is ensuring
that your target size is good.

00:25:58.691 --> 00:26:03.361
A lot of sliders love those little
dotted navigations,

00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:06.111
and usually those dots are really tiny.

00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:13.718
Let's enlarge those and make sure
that they're big enough,

00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:20.211
as well as ensuring that sliders have
proper ARIA attributes so that way,

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:24.931
users on assistive technologies know
what's going on

00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:30.511
and how to get to the content
that you're trying to show them.

00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:34.181
All right.

00:26:34.351 --> 00:26:37.561
We are a little bit out of the animation
realm.

00:26:37.561 --> 00:26:38.231
Take a breath.

00:26:39.651 --> 00:26:43.741
We are moving more into content-based
items.

00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:45.617
Another hydration break here.

00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:50.472
[silence]

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600
All right.

00:26:51.701 --> 00:26:54.901
First up is accordions and toggles.

00:26:55.541 --> 00:26:59.581
These items are great for being able
to display a lot

00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:01.921
of content in a small area,

00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:06.421
but they can really be problematic
for keyboard users

00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:08.801
and users of assistive technologies.

00:27:09.817 --> 00:27:14.021
A lot of times, I've entered an accordion

00:27:14.021 --> 00:27:17.811
or a toggle on a site built
with a page builder,

00:27:17.811 --> 00:27:21.571
and it just doesn't work with a keyboard.

00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:27.821
You should be able to--
Here on the screen,

00:27:27.821 --> 00:27:30.951
I have a screenshot of an accordion.

00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:36.871
This one was actually taken
from Oxygen Extra's site.

00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:40.921
One of the things that they tout on
there is accessible markup,

00:27:41.001 --> 00:27:45.301
which from what I saw, it was accessible.

00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:46.761
They had all the ARIA.

00:27:47.171 --> 00:27:52.891
You should be able to tab on your computer
to the different titles

00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:57.561
within this accordion and then hit enter,
and then you can pop--

00:27:57.561 --> 00:28:00.231
that will pop open
and you can read the content.

00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:05.151
On several page builders out there,

00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:11.161
unfortunately, whenever you tab to it
and you hit enter, it does nothing.

00:28:11.201 --> 00:28:15.161
This is why proper markup is so important.

00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:17.951
Whenever we can mark it up properly
to work,

00:28:17.951 --> 00:28:22.251
why would we do it any other way?

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:25.171
I really don't know.

00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:33.221
Under a similar nature,
waving us in here is tabs.

00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:38.891
In the same way, tabs are also great
for organizing large amounts

00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:42.901
of content while keeping it compact
and easy to understand,

00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:49.571
but these can be problematic
for mobile users, keyboard users,

00:28:49.691 --> 00:28:52.071
and users of assistive technology.

00:28:53.111 --> 00:28:57.541
Again, this is a proceed with caution,
ensuring proper markup.

00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:04.541
The W3C does also have an example
of this of what proper markup looks like.

00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:08.961
If you're curious and then like a tab
on your website,

00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:11.721
that's a great resource to go to.

00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.551
I have a couple screenshots here.

00:29:14.891 --> 00:29:20.431
I have one screenshot on this slide
of a tab on desktop.

00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:25.021
If you are a user navigating
via a keyboard,

00:29:25.401 --> 00:29:32.031
you should be able to hit the tab key
and land on the first tab.

00:29:32.321 --> 00:29:35.451
There's three tabs in the screenshot,

00:29:35.451 --> 00:29:38.081
and then we see a simple
content underneath there.

00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:43.461
You would be able to navigate
to the other tabs via your arrow keys,

00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:49.251
and then you can also hit tab
should there be any linked content

00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:51.171
within the tabs themselves.

00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:57.641
Some of these tab modules,
widgets are marked up better

00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:01.601
on some page builders
than they are on others.

00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.941
I've taken this screenshot
and the following from a site

00:30:05.941 --> 00:30:07.941
that was built on Elementor.

00:30:08.571 --> 00:30:14.031
Then the one thing to also watch out
for is tabs on mobile.

00:30:14.031 --> 00:30:16.201
Whenever you get to a smaller screen,

00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:20.041
they have the tendency
just to want to squish together,

00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:23.121
making all that text very difficult
to read.

00:30:24.371 --> 00:30:27.831
That's why I really like
Elementor's approach.

00:30:28.921 --> 00:30:34.511
On this slide, I'm showing an example
of what the tabs look like on mobile.

00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:43.931
They shrink down to an accordion-like view,
giving the user a more open layout,

00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:47.441
a larger target size,
and ensuring that

00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:52.031
none of those elements end up overlapping,

00:30:52.111 --> 00:30:55.401
just making it a little bit easier to use.

00:30:59.201 --> 00:30:59.781
All right.

00:31:00.121 --> 00:31:03.411
We're coming into our video section.

00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:10.291
Page builders love giving
their users different video options,

00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:14.341
and one of the biggies is overlay images.

00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:20.261
These are images that you can put
on top of your video to fancy it up,

00:31:20.851 --> 00:31:23.721
but you have to watch out
with these kinds of features.

00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:27.021
Because though they may make
your video look a little bit nicer,

00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:28.901
they can serve as a keyboard trap.

00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:34.111
What ends up happening is that the user
is tabbing through your website,

00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:40.661
they get to the video and their focus
ends up going to the player controls

00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:43.581
that are underneath that overlay image,

00:31:43.911 --> 00:31:47.461
so then the user has no clue
where they are on the website.

00:31:48.211 --> 00:31:50.291
It's frustrating, really.

00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:58.631
Then there's the autoplay option,
which should be purely avoided,

00:31:59.721 --> 00:32:04.471
that no user loves to show up on a site
and get bombarded with audio

00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:06.351
that they don't know
where it's coming from,

00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:09.601
or unexpected movement
or anything like that.

00:32:10.441 --> 00:32:13.111
Let them play the video for themselves.

00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:16.941
Then the other option is player controls.

00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:19.951
For some reason, page builders offer this,

00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:24.411
where you can turn the player
controls off of a video.

00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:29.831
Things like the play button, volume,
seeking through the video,

00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:33.131
just let the users have it.

00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:36.131
Make these videos accessible for all.

00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:41.011
Here I have a screenshot
of the video options

00:32:41.011 --> 00:32:45.811
within an Elementor editor
with the autoplay,

00:32:46.391 --> 00:32:52.351
mute and loop all turned off,
and the player controls is set to on,

00:32:53.021 --> 00:32:59.241
which is the ideal settings
that you are going for.

00:33:00.821 --> 00:33:05.741
Then here's a screenshot of what
an image overlay settings

00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:07.871
might look like within your page builder.

00:33:07.871 --> 00:33:10.791
This one was taken from Elementor.

00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:16.841
We can see the image overlay section
with the image overlay set to on,

00:33:16.841 --> 00:33:21.301
and then there's just a placeholder
in that area.

00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:28.601
Then the videos continue here
with background videos.

00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:32.811
Background videos are popular
for hero backgrounds,

00:33:33.191 --> 00:33:38.401
but that continuous movement
can be distressing for users.

00:33:39.281 --> 00:33:43.821
I find that offering a clear
pause/play button for the user

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:49.291
to be able to stop the video
should they wish is a good option.

00:33:49.291 --> 00:33:54.751
Unfortunately, I haven't found
a page builder that has this baked in,

00:33:54.751 --> 00:34:00.341
so I've always had to add some custom
code to do it myself, but it is possible.

00:34:00.881 --> 00:34:04.721
Any page-builder people listening out there,
please add this as an option.

00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:07.011
We would all love you very much.

00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:14.191
Then also ensuring that those background
videos have a good contrast for--

00:34:14.191 --> 00:34:18.651
if you're overlaying any text,
that adding a dark overlay

00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:20.941
can be a good solution for that.

00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:24.651
I just have a screenshot.

00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:29.411
Again, I wasn't going to subject you
to all the movement of a video,

00:34:29.491 --> 00:34:31.411
but in the screenshot,

00:34:31.411 --> 00:34:37.711
we can see that there is a little pause
button up in the upper right-hand corner.

00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:42.801
Then we have some white text
and there's a dark overlay,

00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:47.511
so the user can easily read the content.

00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:51.061
All right.

00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:54.271
Now we're getting into
a little bit of a biggie.

00:34:54.601 --> 00:34:58.231
It is our dynamic post filtering.

00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:06.321
A lot of page builders will offer
like category filtering for blog posts

00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:07.951
and different things like that.

00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:13.251
Unfortunately,
these usually aren't marked up properly.

00:35:13.951 --> 00:35:16.001
Whenever the results are on the same page,

00:35:16.001 --> 00:35:20.001
they are often missing
those proper status messages,

00:35:21.551 --> 00:35:25.381
refocusing the user to where
they should be after the update,

00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:28.511
and including a proper submit button.

00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:33.721
This is a proceed with caution,
but definitely,

00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:39.561
with proper markup,
you can make it work for you.

00:35:39.861 --> 00:35:46.821
Unfortunately, a lot of that proper markup
is going to be through some custom code.

00:35:48.411 --> 00:35:53.661
On the on screen here,
I have an example of some post filters

00:35:53.661 --> 00:35:56.751
that I pulled from
the Oxygen Builder website.

00:35:57.411 --> 00:36:00.331
We see some button filters on the left.

00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:03.881
Which button filters are great.

00:36:03.881 --> 00:36:05.341
You can select one.

00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:12.051
Then if the content changes,
we can serve the user a status message,

00:36:12.551 --> 00:36:14.471
so if they're on assistive technology,

00:36:14.471 --> 00:36:17.101
they know that something
on the page has changed.

00:36:17.601 --> 00:36:20.731
Then we update those blog posts.

00:36:20.941 --> 00:36:23.151
If, say, this were a dropdown,

00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:26.651
where the user has to select
an item from the dropdown,

00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:31.281
then we would want to ensure that
there's a nice apply button.

00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:36.411
That way, we're not changing
those results on an input.

00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:39.371
Just keeping a close eye on that.

00:36:40.711 --> 00:36:46.511
Then last but not least,
waving us in is our contact forms.

00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:51.841
A lot of page builders
have built-in contact forms that,

00:36:52.091 --> 00:36:56.391
unfortunately,
aren't marked up properly with proper labels,

00:36:56.521 --> 00:37:00.731
required field indication,
and proper validation messages.

00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:05.401
This is something that is a proceed
with caution.

00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:10.241
There's a lot of good third-party
plugins out there, such as Gravity Forms,

00:37:10.701 --> 00:37:16.621
that offer you a little bit more flexibility
and better leverage over your forms.

00:37:18.291 --> 00:37:22.371
An example here,
I pulled this from the Divi website,

00:37:22.421 --> 00:37:24.881
is we have a contact form,

00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:29.881
and they're using placeholders
instead of labels.

00:37:30.261 --> 00:37:34.851
If a user begins to type in there,
they won't remember what field they're on.

00:37:34.851 --> 00:37:36.811
It's problematic.

00:37:36.811 --> 00:37:38.391
It's hard to use.

00:37:39.471 --> 00:37:45.271
Then if they were to hit submit,
we see a screenshot

00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:49.941
of the submitted version
where there's validation errors.

00:37:52.651 --> 00:37:56.201
There's no required indication on these.

00:37:57.451 --> 00:38:00.751
It just says,
"Please fill in the following fields,"

00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:06.291
and lists name and message,
but there's still nothing telling you

00:38:06.291 --> 00:38:08.461
that these fields are required.

00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:12.511
We entered an invalid email address

00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:14.181
and it just says, "Invalid email,"

00:38:14.181 --> 00:38:20.141
but it doesn't give us any good reason
of why or how to fix it.

00:38:21.981 --> 00:38:24.311
I pulled another example here.

00:38:24.351 --> 00:38:31.031
We have a screenshot, and we can see
that we have the email labels

00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:34.111
with the required indicators on them.

00:38:34.151 --> 00:38:39.991
Then you have an invalid email address
typed in, just email@ex.

00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:43.751
We get a proper validation message
this time that says,

00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:45.711
"The email address entered is invalid.

00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:47.251
Please check the formatting,"

00:38:47.581 --> 00:38:51.761
and then gives an example
of a proper email address.

00:38:51.801 --> 00:38:57.261
That is a better way to let users know that,
hey, you messed up.

00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:01.221
Here's how you can easily fix it.

00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:05.851
That leads us to our wrap-up.

00:39:07.191 --> 00:39:10.021
At the end of the day, page builders are-

00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:14.691
they can be super helpful
and these incredibly flexible tools,

00:39:14.691 --> 00:39:17.321
but they come with a lot of responsibility

00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:23.621
at not just blindly trusting
these page builders,

00:39:24.661 --> 00:39:28.631
and ensuring that we are doing all
the testing and everything as needed.

00:39:29.211 --> 00:39:34.841
Today I will not be giving you
what I think the best,

00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:37.591
most accessible page builder is,

00:39:38.011 --> 00:39:40.891
but if that is something
that you are curious in,

00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:44.931
there are lots of blog posts and podcasts.

00:39:45.561 --> 00:39:48.061
I know that there's some
that just recently happened

00:39:48.061 --> 00:39:51.731
that go over all that
and give a better look.

00:39:52.651 --> 00:39:55.781
Then now we're at time for questions.

00:39:58.031 --> 00:39:59.361
<v Simon> Thank you so much, Scarlett.

00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:02.531
That was very informative and insightful.

00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:07.331
Some great examples
from various page builders

00:40:07.791 --> 00:40:10.081
and a lot of useful information there.

00:40:10.081 --> 00:40:16.461
We do have a bunch of questions,
so we'll get to them as we can.

00:40:18.721 --> 00:40:25.851
Rosita asks, "I have a problem
with the section tag in Elementor.

00:40:26.061 --> 00:40:31.231
It converts all of the inner containers
into sections automatically.

00:40:32.521 --> 00:40:33.861
That is not correct, right?"

00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:38.071
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:40:38.571 --> 00:40:42.661
Elementor now offers
a container structure as well.

00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:48.621
Their previous version, every one of those--
every section,

00:40:48.621 --> 00:40:53.961
is literally what they call it,
did have the section tag on it.

00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:59.131
Now if you are switching over
to their new container structure,

00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:01.551
though it may look scary,
I do recommend it.

00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:06.101
It gives you a lot more flexibility
to be able to assign those landmarks,

00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:09.351
like I showed within that screenshot.

00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:13.771
<v Simon> Great.

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:14.981
Thank you for that.

00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:18.611
All right.

00:41:20.031 --> 00:41:26.031
David says that Elementor Pro's custom
attributes are added

00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:29.791
to the wrapper div
instead of the inner element.

00:41:33.961 --> 00:41:40.721
Is that a good way for remediating
accessibility issues?

00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:45.181
<v Scarlett> Not always.

00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.271
You will want to make sure
that wherever your--

00:41:48.721 --> 00:41:53.101
your custom attribute is being applied
to wherever it's needed.

00:41:53.401 --> 00:41:57.231
For instance, in our primary nav example,

00:41:57.821 --> 00:42:03.411
you would want to make sure that
it is getting applied where that nav tag is.

00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:06.621
Unfortunately,
sometimes within page builders,

00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:09.331
it's hard to tell exactly
where it's going to add it,

00:42:09.331 --> 00:42:12.961
and a lot of times it does end up
adding it to that wrapper.

00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:18.881
That's where adding some custom code
and things like that,

00:42:18.881 --> 00:42:21.631
unfortunately, come in.

00:42:22.261 --> 00:42:24.681
Ultimately,
I would say just do your testing

00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:26.931
and make sure that it makes sense
where it's at.

00:42:30.061 --> 00:42:31.181
<v Simon> All right, thank you.

00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:38.651
Someone mentions that sliders are the one

00:42:38.651 --> 00:42:42.741
and only for everyone
in the world of websites.

00:42:44.821 --> 00:42:49.701
I've got my clients to not do it,
use sliders, I guess,

00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:52.121
but what alternatives do you use?

00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:55.871
Can you explain or give a URL,

00:42:55.871 --> 00:42:58.791
an example about
how to make a slider accessible?

00:43:01.381 --> 00:43:01.921
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:07.591
My recommendation is just don't.

00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:11.771
I know that that's not the most popular
answer for some clients.

00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:14.021
I know that some really like it.

00:43:14.431 --> 00:43:16.851
If you can provide them a good argument--

00:43:17.311 --> 00:43:20.571
I know a lot like sliders
within the heroes.

00:43:22.481 --> 00:43:26.151
If you can compromise on having
a background image

00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:28.161
with maybe some overlaid text,

00:43:28.661 --> 00:43:32.451
ensuring that there's a nice background
overlay for that high contrast.

00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:38.541
Then I usually recommend
an image-text section,

00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:41.001
so something that has an image
and some text,

00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:46.011
just so that way the user can see
everything laid out for them.

00:43:46.631 --> 00:43:48.261
I think the argument here is really,

00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:51.721
don't be hiding this content
from your users.

00:43:51.721 --> 00:43:54.771
It can really affect
a company's bottom line,

00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:56.811
if you happen to be building
for a company,

00:43:57.191 --> 00:44:00.771
that users are missing out on
a lot of things or getting frustrated.

00:44:01.021 --> 00:44:02.981
Oh, and for an accessible slider,

00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:07.741
I know that the W3C does have examples

00:44:07.741 --> 00:44:11.371
of what an accessible slider markup
looks like as well.

00:44:12.371 --> 00:44:12.581
<v Simon> Yes.

00:44:12.581 --> 00:44:17.291
Just to confirm, you're talking about
slider carousels for images

00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:18.371
and other content, right?

00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:22.001
Not just form control sliders
that are custom components, correct?

00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:23.091
<v Scarlett> Correct, yes.

00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:24.251
Thank you, Simon.

00:44:24.251 --> 00:44:24.551
Yes.

00:44:24.841 --> 00:44:25.461
<v Simon> Sure, yes.

00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:31.681
Paul asks, "Can you please address
how to make a mega menu accessible?"

00:44:32.391 --> 00:44:32.931
<v Scarlett> Oh, boy.

00:44:33.261 --> 00:44:35.601
Paul, you're really going
for the gusto here, Paul.

00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:44.821
Within our limited time, probably not.

00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:50.531
I think there's ensuring that--

00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:55.371
Well, kind of goes with ensuring that
all your landmarks and ARIA labels--

00:44:55.371 --> 00:44:58.791
there's a lot of ARIA labeling
and everything that goes into mega menus.

00:44:59.711 --> 00:45:05.671
That's a little bit of a bigger topic,
maybe a topic for next year.

00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:07.301
[laughter]

00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:09.511
<v Simon> Well said.

00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:12.721
Let's see.

00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:19.311
Basa, I hope I got that name right,

00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:23.101
says that utilizing accordions,
accordion-like,

00:45:23.691 --> 00:45:27.901
or the details tag is said
not to be accessible.

00:45:29.691 --> 00:45:32.741
They've heard that from a few sessions
or webinars.

00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:38.251
The user cannot put the list
of all headings

00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:42.501
into those sections in the heading tree

00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:44.961
since they are all collapsed,

00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:50.221
so the assistive technology users
may miss some content.

00:45:50.921 --> 00:45:52.381
What is your take on that,

00:45:52.761 --> 00:45:55.801
about accordions and details and stuff,
I guess?

00:45:57.101 --> 00:46:02.731
<v Scarlett> Yes, that's a good call-out
and a good question.

00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:09.361
I would say, one,
I would recommend keeping the content

00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:12.741
within your accordion relatively simple.

00:46:13.701 --> 00:46:19.451
Personally, I haven't dived into
the details tag so much on accordions.

00:46:19.871 --> 00:46:23.751
I haven't really found them necessary
within my markup,

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:29.251
but maybe I'm missing something,
so somebody inform me if I am.

00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:32.131
<v Simon> Okay.

00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:34.551
We have time for one more, I think.

00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:43.731
Someone asked, "Would you explain
dynamic post filtering again?

00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:47.191
Is it sort of a blog default?"

00:46:49.401 --> 00:46:49.821
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:56.361
The post filtering-- so if you go to,
say, a blog landing page,

00:46:56.361 --> 00:46:58.621
for example, and they'll give you a list

00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:05.961
of categories to search by
to help filter down your post results,

00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:09.591
so that's what I mean by
the dynamic post filtering.

00:47:09.591 --> 00:47:14.301
It's these filters that apply
it to these posts.

00:47:14.801 --> 00:47:20.141
Then whenever you apply that,
there's a lot of- as I covered,

00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:24.891
a lot of markup and different things
that can get lost within there.

00:47:24.891 --> 00:47:28.731
It's a little simple,
but hopefully that helped a little bit.

00:47:28.731 --> 00:47:33.031
A good third-party plugin, if you're having
issues with that on your site,

00:47:33.031 --> 00:47:35.741
is like FacetWP or something like that,

00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:39.411
that gives you more leverage
over different kinds of filters.

00:47:39.411 --> 00:47:43.701
I wouldn't say it's necessarily
a blog default.

00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:47.251
You typically see it on
a little bit more advanced sites

00:47:47.251 --> 00:47:49.881
or sites that have more extensive blogs.

00:47:51.631 --> 00:47:52.171
<v Simon> Great.

00:47:52.171 --> 00:47:53.131
Thank you so much.

00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:55.131
There are a bunch of other questions,

00:47:55.131 --> 00:47:57.181
but unfortunately,
we're just about out of time.

00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:04.061
I want to thank you again, Scarlett,
