<v Announcer> WordPress Accessibility
Day 2024,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
Maintaining Your Site's
Accessibility Well After Launch,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.830
with speaker Jeanette Stair,
Accessibility Lead

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.280
and Project Director,
Government Services, at Forum One.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.267
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.529
<v Sherose> Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.980
My name is Sherose Badruddin,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.230
and I'm from the University
of North Carolina.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.440
I'm a digital accessibility consultant.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.170
Thank you for joining us
for our last session.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
This is hosted by Jeanette Stair.

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:37.530
The session is titled, Maintaining
Your Site's Accessibility Well

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.812
After Launch.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.630
Jeanette is an Accessibility Lead
and Project Director

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.030
for Government Services, Forum One.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.709
Since 2009,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.019
Jeanette has learned
about and practiced making

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.509
digital products accessible
for federal, state,

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.989
and local government clients,

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.219
as well as large and small
non-government organizations.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.249
She's passionate about helping
everyone access the information

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.449
and services they need.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.769
Audience, feel free to add
your questions to the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.319
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.919
You can use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.519
Jeanette, take it away.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Jeanette> Thanks so much.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.042
It's such an honor to be presenting
at this conference.

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:24.359
There have been
so many good presentations already,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.739
and especially

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550
to close out the conference today.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130
Thanks to the organizers for that.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.630
I feel like this is a good topic
for the end of this conference.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.170
We've been talking about websites,
making them accessible,

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.935
and now I want to talk
about how to keep that up.

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:49.439
That was a great introduction.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:52.139
Ooh, hold on one second.

00:01:53.477 --> 00:02:01.439
A lot of this we went over already,
although I will add that I recently got

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.809
my CPAC certification

00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:08.849
from the International Association
of Accessibility Professionals.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.920
Also, that this presentation is built
on more than just my experience.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.068
This is also
the experience of my colleagues

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.209
at Forum One.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.778
We do a lot of website work,
a lot of WordPress,

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:25.979
a lot of Drupal,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.350
and other platforms

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.869
for different kinds of clients.

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.380
I've worked a lot
with the federal government,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.339
but also getting
into non-government organizations,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.848
federal, state, and local,
in the US though,

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.849
mostly.

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.218
We'll go from there.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.688
That's my context.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.170
That's my background
that I'll be sharing and moving from.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.329
This talk is based on that idea
that you've designed a website,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.069
you've built a website,

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.180
maybe something a little larger,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.890
something that has multiple people
contributing to content,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.990
whether or not they're actually entering
the content into WordPress or not,

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:18.360
but that kind of idea.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.250
That website has been designed,
built recently

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.800
with accessibility in mind.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.320
You're starting from a good place.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.939
You've done checks,
and you want to keep that up.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.079
There can be some challenges
to doing that.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.469
We'll talk about a few things

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.479
in this presentation.

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.109
One, is common challenges
for content contributors.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.420
Then we'll go into effective accessibility
governance planning,

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.809
also monitoring and audit strategies,
and long-term considerations.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.260
I'm just going to switch up
my slides real quick.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440
One moment.

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.019
We should be back on track.

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:17.605
Thanks.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.229
One of the common challenges

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:28.079
with maintaining content after launch
is falling into old habits.

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:32.549
Especially if you have
a larger group of people

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.590
who are contributing to content,

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.329
and if they don't have
a strong background in accessibility,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.533
if this is a newer thing for them,
and they're used to maintaining

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.439
maybe a previous version of the website
that was less geared

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.699
towards accessibility,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.099
didn't have those features,
has a new design with the new website.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.439
Especially when people
are working under time constraints,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.250
and I feel like most people
have time constraints,

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:09.030
it's just so easy
to slip back into old habits,

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.880
what you're comfortable with,
what you're used to.

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.150
Then moving forward,

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:19.679
how you can address this
or how an organization can address this is

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.150
by creating new habits.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.119
This is the best thing that can be done.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.329
Part of it is making sure
people are trained,

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.030
that they have that information
about how to write for web,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.219
what the accessibility considerations
are with writing content,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.469
and then practicing it over and over,

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.599
making it automatic.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.030
Then it's not something extra.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.210
It's not something that people
have to think about.

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.339
It just is something
that when you do the content,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.626
when you create it,
when you're writing it,

00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:00.119
you just do it

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.580
with those best practices

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:05.160
because it's automatic.

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.175
That needs some support.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.470
That needs that training upfront.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.509
That needs making sure
there's reminders and checks on that

00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:17.970
to make sure it's happening.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.879
It becomes a habit and then
it's just in the flow.

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:22.659
That's the goal.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.579
Other challenges.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.859
Design system not working.

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:31.858
This assumes that you have
a design system,

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.479
which is always something

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.519
that is good for a website,
making sure you have consistency

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.898
across the website.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.749
You have standard heading styles.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.460
You have standard components
that can be reused throughout the website.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.059
Something that happens is
that it might not be complete.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.040
Parts of it might not work.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.167
You have to expect this upfront.

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.747
Examples of what this looks like
or red flags

00:07:04.748 --> 00:07:06.269
that this might be the issue.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.719
If content editors
don't use headings correctly.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040
See this a lot.

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.800
It's they choose the one
that they like visually.

00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:19.109
Maybe that hierarchy
isn't clear enough with the headings,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.719
or H4 is more exciting than H3,
so people want to use it more.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:27.509
That's a sign of that design system.

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.600
It's not really working
and maybe needs some tweaks.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.179
Another example of this
is using images of text.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.369
Maybe there's no component available
that combines text and images

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.719
in the way people need.

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:48.399
Then that might be something
that's missing from the design system

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.860
that needs to be added to make sure
that we're using best practices.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.390
Then something
that comes up frequently, too,

00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:02.250
is too few or maybe too many ways
to emphasize information.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.169
This can start with a content issue
of making sure

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.949
that the content has
a clear goal and a clear message.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.712
Sometimes people get a little excited
about wanting

00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:21.030
to highlight everything on a page
and then so nothing really stands out.

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:25.859
Making sure that content is structured
in a way that has a clear message

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.559
and goal, but then making sure
that the design system also supports that,

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:36.088
that there are appropriate ways
that are then marked up correctly

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:40.289
for accessibility for people
to highlight information.

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:43.559
They're not using components
in the wrong way.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:44.769
For example,

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:47.910
using a pull quote just to make
something look good,

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:49.589
even if it's not a quote.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.900
That wouldn't be ideal.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.019
Ways to address this,

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.029
plan for that.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.300
Plan to review and update
the design system.

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:04.379
Plan that it's not a static thing
and it will need maintenance.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.059
It'll need growth over time.

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:11.889
Another way

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.531
or other strategies
involved in making sure is

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:18.090
making sure
that there's documentation.

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.909
This is something
that can be hard to get in

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.109
to a website design and build project,

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:30.239
but can be added to along
the way as you have a website.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.529
Having examples and guidelines
for content editors

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.560
on how different components
should be used,

00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:47.220
how to get across the messages they want,
that can be really helpful.

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:53.549
Sometimes including the rationale
on why these components should be used

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.103
in this way

00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:59.510
can be helpful in helping people
understand and remember

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.690
why they need to use
one component over another,

00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:05.129
why they shouldn't be using

00:10:05.549 --> 00:10:09.765
a component for something
that it's not intended for.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.860
Another common challenge,
content approval.

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:22.199
Especially with my background working
with larger government organizations,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.059
but this can come up in any
kind of organization depending

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.893
on how formal it is.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.990
There can be this issue where content
is created in Microsoft Word document.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.880
It's emailed between multiple people
and there's an approval process.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.498
That wording,

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:47.549
that specific wording
is approved by three people,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.649
one of which is
the top leader of the organization.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.770
It cannot be changed.

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.159
However,

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.288
trying to get it on the web,
maybe it's not following

00:11:01.289 --> 00:11:03.089
those accessibility guidelines.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.149
It's not following best practices for web.

00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:09.000
There's that tension of,

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:14.099
how much can we change it before it needs
to go through an approval process again?

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:22.679
Really the tactic for that would be
to work accessibility

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.720
into the approval process.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.549
Often, usually it's a legal requirement.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.180
It really should be part
of that approval process.

00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:38.220
This might also be about education
for the organization

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.979
on what those requirements are.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:51.689
Those are some common challenges
and things that pop up or might contribute

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.219
to a website starting off
as highly accessible,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.879
but then starting to morph and change
into something that's less accessible just

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.869
based on content additions or changes.

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:13.499
Next, we'll talk a bit about effective
accessibility governance planning.

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:19.499
Governance planning,

00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:22.680
what we're talking about here is

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:31.170
that organizational structures
that support

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:39.749
the process of updating and making sure
that the website is accessible long-term.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.769
Someone needs to own this process.

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:51.030
If someone's not clearly assigned
or a team is not assigned to this,

00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:54.630
then it's just Wild West,

00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:56.700
it's chaos.

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:04.199
It might happen based on individuals,
but if people switch out or there's

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.990
different people doing it,
won't be consistent.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.939
Somebody should own that.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.869
There should be a monitoring
and audit strategy.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.799
I think a lot of us here know that,

00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:20.010
this is what this talk is about.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.810
It's about, it's not over,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.550
there's no done.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:30.989
There's this continuous need
to make sure things are continuing

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.990
to be accessible.

00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:37.620
That requires monitoring and auditing,
not just one audit and then you're done,

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:39.180
but a strategy.

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:44.459
There should be a review
and update process.

00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:48.029
A lot of teams annually works.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.740
Maybe it needs to be quarterly.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.710
Maybe it can only be every other year.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.099
Figure out what that is for this site
and for the team that manages it.

00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:02.759
The other thing is standards change.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.639
Processes need to change, too.

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.690
Technology changes.

00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:13.327
We know this, we've seen
WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2.

00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:18.420
We're getting ready for WCAG 3
and that's really exciting.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.569
What worked five years ago, 10 years ago,
doesn't work today.

00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:31.829
That governance needs to acknowledge
that and plan for that proactively.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.428
Then this should also include training
and knowledge-sharing practices,

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:43.470
because it's easy to forget things
if you don't use them every day.

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:46.709
If that comes up,
you want to be prepared for that.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.839
You'll have new people joining
organizations and they need to know

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.159
what everybody else knows.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:59.280
Sometimes you tackle a tricky issue
that nobody at the organization

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.270
has had to deal with before.

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:09.450
You need a way to ask
those questions to get

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.930
feedback on what is
the best way to do things.

00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:19.799
Other things involved
in accessibility, governance,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.860
planning
are standard operating procedures.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.078
This is a very formal term,
but just making sure

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.729
that you know

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.740
how you're doing things
for testing updates to the website.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:41.040
How do you make sure features or bug fixes
maintain your accessibility standard?

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:47.158
If you're adding things into it,
are you testing those for accessibility

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:52.800
as well as the intended functionality
and your regression

00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.700
testing to make sure you haven't broken
anything else on the website?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.000
Consider who's responsible
for ensuring accessibility.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.799
You have the code,

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:06.179
you have the content,

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.599
you have the design,
you have third-party tools.

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:16.949
Who's responsible in each of those areas
where things might be able to go wrong

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.720
to make sure that they're not?

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:24.059
Then if you have had issues
and you've fixed them,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.639
how are you verifying that they're fixed?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:35.369
Who's doing the review to make sure
that that change actually changed

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.110
what it intended to?

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.868
Those are some aspects
of governance planning

00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:47.039
for accessibility.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.020
Next, we'll talk about some monitoring
and audit strategies.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.819
Continuous monitoring.

00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:04.229
It's different how you might approach
this for a small site versus a large site.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.880
When I talk about a small site,
I mean like 10 pages,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.510
12 pages, maybe 20 pages on the site.

00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:15.637
Once you start talking
about hundreds of pages,

00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:19.020
thousands of pages,
it's a different story.

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:21.358
Very small sites,

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.020
you might be able to do
continuous monitoring with manual review.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:31.109
You might have dedicated individuals,
they might use automated tools,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.430
but they can do that page-by-page.

00:17:35.219 --> 00:17:36.450
For larger sites,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.040
you might need a tool
that scans through the site.

00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:47.870
There are various tools out there,
some of which include Siteimprove,

00:17:48.422 --> 00:17:52.987
Deque has some tools, Level Access
has a platform for this.

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:57.120
They'll typically do
a scan through a site,

00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:03.044
crawl through every page,
they'll do automated checks.

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:05.529
This can take different amounts of times.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.719
That scan might take

00:18:07.229 --> 00:18:08.819
days or a week to do.

00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:14.459
As we know, if we've been
at some sessions here,

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.160
automated checks are not enough.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:23.609
These platforms typically also will flag
things that need to be manually checked.

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:26.720
It's important to understand

00:18:26.721 --> 00:18:32.070
the limitations
of these automated platforms

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.840
for monitoring.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.651
Some of these tools have
other features such as SEO,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.929
plain language, analytics.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.229
Some of them are very specific
to accessibility.

00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:50.849
The other thing is,
it's not just something

00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:52.258
you can set and forget.

00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:58.019
Somebody needs to look at the results,
somebody needs to do the manual work.

00:18:59.399 --> 00:19:03.869
Even if you're going to pay
for a platform like this,

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:08.190
it's not just on its own,
you also have to manage it.

00:19:12.389 --> 00:19:14.489
Then audits are important, too.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.370
You might have this platform
that does regular scans weekly,

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:22.740
monthly, across the whole site.

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:25.649
Again, it's limited.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.510
Regular audits, say annually,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.741
you would want to plan for.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.150
There are different methods.

00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:42.449
It could be integrated
with that continuous monitoring tool.

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:47.730
You could have manual reviews
from either internally,

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:52.110
or you could partner
with another organization to do that.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.170
Usability testing
with assistive technologies users

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.700
is really important.

00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:04.499
If you can plan for that,

00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:10.889
partner with people who can do that,
or with an organization who has access

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.230
to people who include

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.840
that group,

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:19.330
then that's going
to be extremely valuable.

00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:22.569
Because you're not just getting
accessibility testing,

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:24.699
you're getting usability testing.

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:28.120
We know those are very closely related.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.750
Sample.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.870
These manual tests,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.659
especially if you're
on a large site, hundreds,

00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:38.949
thousands of pages,

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.389
you're not going to be able
to manually check every single page.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.790
You'll want to pick a sample.

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:52.329
W3C has some information
about how to select a sample.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.660
It's good to select pages that cover

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.680
all your different page templates
or post types.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420
For example,

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.790
all your components.

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:11.229
Sometimes it's helpful to set up
a everything-bagel page

00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:16.390
or a kitchen sink page, a page that has
examples of all your different components.

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:21.309
Sometimes that can be part
of your design documentation.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.974
You have examples of components
with how they should be used

00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:28.329
and the guidelines around it.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:33.699
Then you use that page as your test page
to make sure that all those components

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.419
are accessible and usable.

00:21:38.277 --> 00:21:41.049
Your sample should also include
complete processes.

00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:43.840
Maybe your site,
you're asking for donations.

00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:48.719
You want to make sure
that that complete process is accessible

00:21:49.247 --> 00:21:51.009
to all your users.

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:55.059
It might involve multiple pages
or multiple steps.

00:21:57.637 --> 00:22:01.510
I keep mentioning annual
as an example frequency.

00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:06.879
One thing to think
about when you're deciding on a frequency

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.676
for audits is making sure you have
time to fix what you found

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.999
in one audit before you go on
to the next one.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.945
Again, we know that resources
are constrained.

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:20.080
There are many things
that go into websites,

00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.990
security updates, content updates.

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:27.100
Just making sure that,

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:32.259
if you want to do it more often,
if you want to do it quarterly,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.329
is that the right frequency for you?

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.108
Are you able to address
items before the next audit?

00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:42.829
Because if you haven't fixed anything,
then the audit's going

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.630
to show you things you already know.

00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:48.220
Then investment.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.420
You need to plan for resources
to address the items found in audits.

00:22:53.949 --> 00:22:58.689
You have to invest in the audit itself
by also addressing those fixes.

00:22:58.989 --> 00:23:00.400
Who's going to do that?

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:02.649
What kind of budget is there for that?

00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:10.900
Prioritizing accessibility bugs.

00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:13.960
I have a section here.

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:21.430
It's one example of a rating system
that you can use for accessibility bugs.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:27.159
It's not the only factor
for prioritization.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.770
We'll talk a little bit about that, too.

00:23:29.926 --> 00:23:31.359
It's not the only way.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:34.089
This is meant to be more inspirational.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.710
You can use this.

00:23:36.219 --> 00:23:41.560
You can download my slides
and use this rating as is.

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:45.609
I know there was a webinar recently
with another rating system.

00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:50.289
These can be as simple or complex
as you need them to be.

00:23:51.401 --> 00:23:53.380
They're really just meant to be

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:01.870
a helpful thing or a conversation starter
or a way to group

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.389
a lot of bugs.

00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:11.858
I'll talk through how this one works,
but I want to just point out

00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:14.709
that it's not super scientific

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.549
and it's not the only way to do it.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.000
The steps with this method
would be to determine the severity,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.730
how bad a bug is,

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:29.079
the reach,

00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:33.220
how common it is on the website,

00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:37.599
and secondary benefits of fixing
that issue.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.879
Besides accessibility,

00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:43.089
are you getting other benefits

00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:44.860
from fixing that bug?

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:50.019
We have a numerical rating system
for each of those areas.

00:24:50.769 --> 00:24:54.609
Then you can add those numbers
up to give a rating to each ticket

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.538
and then prioritize bugs
based on that rating along

00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:00.159
with other considerations.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.250
We have the numerical ratings.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.080
Severity,

00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:10.989
we can call this,

00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:17.379
it's impossible to do a task or maybe
it's related to WCAG level A.

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:20.710
Those aren't necessarily the same thing,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.469
but it's just a couple of ways
that you can decide that something is

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.549
the worst severity

00:25:28.653 --> 00:25:31.928
and that would have
a numerical rating of 7.

00:25:33.089 --> 00:25:36.939
Then difficult or issues with WCAG AA

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.876
would be 4.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.630
Things that are awkward

00:25:41.321 --> 00:25:46.233
or related to WCAG AAA
would have a rating of 1.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.689
If something's not a best practice,
you might rate it a zero

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.890
for this category.

00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:53.589
Then for reach,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.859
if it's on every single page,
so say it's in the header,

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:59.290
the footer,
or something global element,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.290
you might rate it a 4.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.929
If it's high-traffic pages,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.770
but not all pages, might be 2.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.429
If it's just a couple low-traffic pages,
it might be a zero.

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:15.970
Then under secondary benefits,

00:26:16.528 --> 00:26:19.810
so maybe this affects everyone

00:26:20.469 --> 00:26:22.152
and you might rate that a 2.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.689
Maybe it affects multiple groups,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.639
it's rated at a 1,
or it's really one specific group,

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:33.883
that might be rated as a zero.

00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:36.489
That's really subjective.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.450
Examples of how this might play out.

00:26:41.754 --> 00:26:45.519
Maybe your bug is the main menu
is not keyboard accessible.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.658
That's a severity of 7.

00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:49.929
It's impossible to use with a keyboard.

00:26:50.499 --> 00:26:53.375
The reach is rated 4

00:26:53.915 --> 00:26:56.315
because it's on every single page
of the website.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.850
Secondary benefits has a 2
because it affects everybody,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.810
whether or not you're using
assistive technology.

00:27:06.129 --> 00:27:09.550
Keyboards are standard input device.

00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:13.125
That rating might be 13.

00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:16.060
You might have an image
that's missing alt text.

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:18.138
Again, severity is 7.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.409
It's impossible to get that content.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:28.028
Reach might be zero
because it's really only on,

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:32.169
oh, like in this scenario,
it might be on a very low-traffic page

00:27:32.874 --> 00:27:34.780
that's just one page on the site.

00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:37.060
Secondary benefits,

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.959
I have here a zero,
although I think that's debatable.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.424
That overall rating would be 7.

00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:46.659
I have a third example,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.819
heading level is skipped.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.037
On this page, you go from H2 to H4,

00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:54.683
back to H2.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.519
Severity is zero
because this is a best practice.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.999
I think some of us feel very strongly
about it,

00:28:02.199 --> 00:28:05.620
but it's not technically a failure.

00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:09.489
People can still access the content.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.481
The reach might be most pages, 2,

00:28:14.885 --> 00:28:15.993
rating of 2.

00:28:16.221 --> 00:28:17.710
Secondary benefits

00:28:18.157 --> 00:28:20.047
might be a rating of 1.

00:28:20.187 --> 00:28:21.849
The rating for that one,

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.365
I see a math problem
with my slide, would be 3.

00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:28.670
This is just one way to pair

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.480
those three issues and say, okay,

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:35.317
the main menu
not being keyboard accessible

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:39.010
is the most severe issue here.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.628
It has the most reach
and secondary benefits to fixing it.

00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:47.078
That's what I'm going
to invest in before I worry

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:49.119
about the skipped heading levels.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.460
Prioritization can be
based on other things as well.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.589
Your development workflow.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.590
Do you have separate developers
for front-end and back-end?

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.239
Do you want to group
things by who has time?

00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:10.463
Maybe your front-end developer

00:29:10.511 --> 00:29:14.889
wants to change global styles
before component styles.

00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:20.902
There might be an order
that makes the most sense

00:29:21.371 --> 00:29:23.290
just with the development workflow.

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:30.009
Also, there might be accessibility
gain per time spent.

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:33.520
You have that overall rating,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.479
but how much time is it going
to take to address that?

00:29:37.749 --> 00:29:41.200
You might have something
that's pretty important,

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:43.390
but it's also going to take a lot of time.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.738
You might have things that are medium,
but will be very quick

00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:52.959
and can be grouped together,
10 of them done with the same code change.

00:29:53.373 --> 00:29:54.820
That might change

00:29:55.989 --> 00:29:57.609
what your priorities are.

00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:02.379
You might tackle low-hanging fruit,
or to put it a different way,

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:06.849
those things that are easier to address,
quicker to address,

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:11.411
to get the more accessibility
improvements quicker,

00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:17.439
and then tackle those
more difficult things next.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:22.358
Just some things to think
about when prioritizing,

00:30:22.359 --> 00:30:28.808
especially if you have a lot of issues,
if you have fewer or your context

00:30:28.809 --> 00:30:32.949
is different, you might have
different items and you might want

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.219
to create a rating system
that's more unique to you.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.529
That other webinar

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.339
or slides I was looking
at had things to do about,

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.239
they had multiple products
and they had prioritization

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.580
based on which product it was
or which audience it affected.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.769
Those are other things that might play
into your prioritization decisions.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.308
Those were some monitoring
and audit strategies,

00:31:06.309 --> 00:31:14.259
as well as that bonus methods
for prioritization of addressing issues.

00:31:14.889 --> 00:31:18.429
Next, we'll talk
about some other long-term considerations.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.859
Going back to that theme of it's not over,
there's no done,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.879
there's no end,
accessibility guidelines change,

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.550
technology changes,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.299
browsers change,
assistive technology changes,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.470
and we need to be prepared
for what we're doing now,

00:31:41.889 --> 00:31:45.490
not being enough,
not being the right thing,

00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:48.610
not being the standard thing for later.

00:31:50.289 --> 00:31:54.788
Also, organizations change,
the work changes,

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:56.249
work context changes,

00:31:56.335 --> 00:31:57.605
who's there.

00:31:57.697 --> 00:32:01.030
Capacity and processes
need to change, too.

00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:08.020
Those are long-term considerations.

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:10.809
That's my entire presentation.

00:32:11.019 --> 00:32:13.149
We'll have a little extra time,

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.349
I think, for Q&amp;A,

00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:17.050
but yes,

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:22.149
I hope that's helpful and I'm excited
to answer some questions.

00:32:22.947 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Sherose> Jeanette, thank you so much.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:31.689
It is helpful, especially for state
and local government employees

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.549
here thinking about the new ADA rule,
but we'll get into that.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.400
I want to go ahead and start
with some audience questions.

00:32:39.939 --> 00:32:42.759
How do you get buy-in
for the annual review?

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.369
I've always had support
for building accessibly,

00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:48.220
but the mentality seems to be
that since it was made properly

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.270
in the first place,
that's good enough for two to three years.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:55.062
<v Jeanette> Oh, two to three years, yes.

00:32:55.135 --> 00:33:01.299
That's part of why my recommendation
is to start that conversation early.

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:08.229
If you're contracting or you're getting
approval for the project to design

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.639
and build the site,
it being part of that conversation

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.819
is, I think, an easier sell than,

00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:17.239
oh,

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.820
we just finished this project,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.609
we spent all this money,
now can we have more?

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:27.054
Having it upfront
as part of the original project,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.939
just knowing and acknowledging
that there will be that maintenance

00:33:31.529 --> 00:33:32.761
is part of it.

00:33:33.397 --> 00:33:35.590
Another way to approach it is,

00:33:36.879 --> 00:33:41.770
and I hope this is not a hard sell,
is websites require maintenance.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.005
If nothing else, security maintenance.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.710
This is just like that.

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:52.630
Doing accessibility audits
is like doing a security audit.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.339
These are all requirements
that websites need to act under.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:01.058
Your website needs to be usable to people.

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:02.620
Do you do analytics?

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:07.540
This is in that world
of website maintenance.

00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:10.629
Those are a couple ideas.

00:34:11.673 --> 00:34:15.188
It's really specific
based on your organization,

00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:16.810
what's going to work.

00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:22.329
Those are some brainstorm ideas
on the top of my head.

00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:24.909
<v Sherose> I think it's helpful
to frame it as maintenance.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:26.110
It's required maintenance.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.850
We'll be maintaining anyways,

00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:30.519
and here's where else we can slip that in.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.407
That makes a lot of sense.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.099
Two similar questions.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.678
If there's an annual review,
do you also recommend

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.080
annual refresh training
for content creators

00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:42.909
or anyone else involved with the site?

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:48.820
The second question is, for new employees,
how are they most effectively taught

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:50.449
digital accessibility practices?

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:51.789
During onboarding,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.220
once required training, or something else?

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.569
<v Jeanette> That's something
that I'm still figuring out.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.859
I know there's been
a lot of activity in the chat,

00:35:02.864 --> 00:35:05.649
so curious to see
what people say about that.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.739
I think annual trainings, again,
if we use that idea

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.928
that it's just like other aspects,

00:35:13.988 --> 00:35:18.735
like when I work
under federal government contracts,

00:35:18.952 --> 00:35:21.068
I have cybersecurity training.

00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:22.750
That's an annual requirement.

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:24.819
It's a refresher.

00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:30.189
I think the exact frequency
depends maybe on your role

00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:32.439
or on your context.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:37.450
I think an annual refresh is good
for a lot of different things,

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.430
including accessibility.

00:35:40.809 --> 00:35:43.059
I don't know if that's the only thing.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.369
I think it's also helpful to have

00:35:46.949 --> 00:35:49.064
support for that throughout.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:56.920
Have a Slack channel or a Teams chat
where people can go and ask questions,

00:35:58.109 --> 00:36:00.580
have a community or a work group,

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.299
maybe tie things to the audit.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.199
Maybe if you have your annual audit
and you get that approved,

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:12.010
you get those findings back.

00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:14.769
Maybe that's a good time
to share the findings,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:20.798
talk through how we can avoid issues
in the future or what we might want

00:36:20.799 --> 00:36:22.570
to brush up on more specifically.

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:25.809
<v Sherose> That's excellent.
It's super helpful.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.309
To that end, are there workflows
or knowledge-sharing processes

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.460
that you've observed
that are most effective

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.840
in keeping either staff trained
or digital content in compliance

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.359
for a low-resource company?

00:36:40.809 --> 00:36:43.209
What was it that made them effective?

00:36:44.247 --> 00:36:48.100
<v Jeanette> I'm going
to be just very upfront.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.779
I put together this presentation
because it's a problem.

00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:57.370
It's not something I've seen
a lot of good examples of,

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:02.499
or maybe those good examples
don't need me and my company to help them.

00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:10.629
They're maybe in their own happy bubble
and it's not something I've seen.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.879
I don't have a lot of examples
because it's a hard thing.

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:22.209
People are struggling with it
and we're all in that together of trying

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.898
to figure out what will work,
and what works for one organization

00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:27.649
won't necessarily work for another.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.329
I'm sorry to say
I don't have an answer to that one.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.250
<v Sherose> What I'm getting
from you, though,

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:38.765
is that what would be effective
would be a multi-pronged approach.

00:37:38.918 --> 00:37:40.626
It's high-level buy-in.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.599
It's your own knowledge
and dedication to it.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.030
You had mentioned earlier,

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.620
to have someone appointed
for accessibility governance.

00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:52.779
Maybe if it's not you,

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.618
then it's someone else
in partnership with you

00:37:55.619 --> 00:37:56.619
or otherwise

00:37:57.342 --> 00:37:59.430
doing what you could
either to get resources

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.554
or find resources
that are free and accessible

00:38:01.554 --> 00:38:04.154
or already at your company
that can be used that way.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.510
Is that something you've maybe observed?

00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:09.009
<v Jeanette> Yes.
I think that's a great summary.

00:38:09.009 --> 00:38:12.910
That would certainly be
the approach that I would recommend.

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:15.698
Based on the learnings,

00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:17.849
webinars, and trainings
that I've looked at,

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.259
try all those things.

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:25.358
Have that Slack channel,
that work group that doesn't really take

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:26.979
a lot of resources.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.599
Just have a way for people
to talk to each other.

00:38:33.939 --> 00:38:35.018
I would, I think,

00:38:35.019 --> 00:38:41.169
call out that IAAP,
who I mentioned has certifications.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:45.879
That's the International Association
of Accessibility Professionals.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.119
There is a cost for their membership.

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:53.559
You can get either individual
or you can get small organization,

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.799
but they have
an excellent discussion board.

00:38:58.059 --> 00:39:02.410
That's also a way to get
access to trainings.

00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:06.940
There are a lot of free webinars
like WordPress Accessibility Day

00:39:07.236 --> 00:39:08.530
and others

00:39:09.399 --> 00:39:11.320
that you can access.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.673
Then those discussions boards

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:17.591
have an active community
that's just beautiful to watch

00:39:17.592 --> 00:39:21.339
and you can ask questions
and get really great answers.

00:39:22.419 --> 00:39:27.009
<v Sherose> I like what you said there
about finding essentially affinity groups

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.554
or groups within the same work
as you to find what they're doing

00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:34.527
for accessibility
successfully in their realm.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.699
If you are managing

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:42.128
a startup for a WooCommerce site,
that you would see

00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:45.729
what other WooCommerce startups
are doing to keep their sites accessible.

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:48.640
There's a lot on the internet
and a lot to look up,

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.450
that there might be something out there
where someone has this answer for you.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.729
Or the training already worked out.

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:57.879
There's no reason to, as we say,
reinvent the wheel.

00:39:58.371 --> 00:39:59.671
Something's already there.

00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:01.390
I like that perspective.

00:40:02.669 --> 00:40:04.819
Let's see, we have
some more questions here.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.370
In the same realm,

00:40:08.289 --> 00:40:10.840
thanks so much
for your excellent presentation today.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.720
Any tips for having clients
really hear us,

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.589
developers and designers,
about the importance of hierarchy

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.870
and clear, concise messaging?

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:22.210
I agree with the example you used.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.579
If everything is special,
nothing is special.

00:40:24.939 --> 00:40:27.590
Sometimes client just won't hear it.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.829
<v Jeanette> Yes, that is true.

00:40:31.022 --> 00:40:32.570
That is my experience.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.960
My approach to this

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:40.160
is, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:43.219
They might not hear it that first time.

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:45.890
They might not hear it
that first five times.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.798
Especially if you have
a relationship with them,

00:40:48.799 --> 00:40:54.499
it's not just a design
and build, it's also support

00:40:54.527 --> 00:40:56.479
or long-term maintenance.

00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:59.238
Just keep bringing it up.

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:00.620
It's always an issue.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.675
Maybe you'll, over time,

00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:09.615
convince them or brainwash them
into understanding this.

00:41:09.719 --> 00:41:14.749
The other thing is pointing to references.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.489
Nielsen Norman Group is something
that a lot of people respect.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.710
Maybe your client doesn't know them.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.780
Maybe your client is government
and would appreciate

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.199
resources from a government agency.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:34.233
Then there's plainlanguage.gov.

00:41:34.286 --> 00:41:36.770
There's UK guidelines.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.089
You can point
to what your client will respect.

00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:45.498
That can be really helpful, I think,
in trying to convince them

00:41:45.499 --> 00:41:49.279
is pointing to, look,
these are the guidelines.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.839
These are the best practices.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.069
Here's the data.

00:41:52.249 --> 00:41:54.440
Some people really respond to data.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.259
Or some people respond
to the more usability,

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.610
human-centered

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.110
reasons.

00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:05.389
Going through in more detail.

00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:06.569
Why?

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.079
Why should we have good structured data?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.980
What does that really mean for people?

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.349
How do people

00:42:13.159 --> 00:42:14.450
consume data?

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:20.360
Some of those things can help depending
on who it is you're trying to convince.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.508
<v Sherose> I like what you
say about using data

00:42:24.568 --> 00:42:30.530
and maybe a human-centered frame
to sell this point.

00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:33.854
I think I attended

00:42:34.939 --> 00:42:40.340
a webinar a few months ago
where someone used the phrase,

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.950
people you are choosing to exclude.

00:42:43.393 --> 00:42:45.829
I think that isn't that awesome?

00:42:46.165 --> 00:42:50.478
I think if someone can bring
that to your client and be like,

00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:52.099
"Well, based on this data,

00:42:52.189 --> 00:42:54.639
these are the people
you are choosing to exclude."

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.574
Maybe say it a little nicer
than I just delivered.

00:42:57.678 --> 00:43:00.191
<v Jeanette> I don't know.
<v Sherose> You know your client.

00:43:00.191 --> 00:43:03.291
<v Jeanette> Maybe it needs to be that.
Maybe you work up to that.

00:43:03.316 --> 00:43:05.804
<v Sherose> Work up to that
<v Jeanette> Maybe you get to that point.

00:43:05.804 --> 00:43:08.449
<v Sherose> Right. Ultimately,
I think as designers and developers,

00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:11.150
you are the expert
in how this information is conveyed.

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.855
I think that doesn't necessarily
mean the client

00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:16.400
doesn't know that when they hire you,

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.089
but maybe could use a reminder
that you know what you're talking about.

00:43:20.437 --> 00:43:23.913
<v Jeanette> There's some
interesting dynamics there, too,

00:43:23.947 --> 00:43:29.900
of sometimes we get hired even though
the internal staff know perfectly

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.519
what we're saying,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.730
but leadership needs to hear it
from another voice.

00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:38.069
Maybe if I get hired
and I'm saying it,

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:40.605
maybe I'm not the voice
they need to hear it from.

00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:43.230
Maybe they need it internal
or maybe they need it

00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:45.589
from an external voice.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:50.339
It's interesting how
that can play out dynamically, too.

00:43:51.572 --> 00:43:53.058
<v Sherose> Yes.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.349
A couple of questions
about accessibility governance.

00:43:57.709 --> 00:44:01.340
What type of governance documents
do you suggest?

00:44:02.643 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Jeanette> I have mixed
feelings about this.

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:15.379
As a student of Agile, people
and processes over documents idea.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:23.210
I don't think that it's helpful
to perfectly craft a written document

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:25.970
and have it on a shelf
where nobody reads it.

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:32.420
Going through the process of creating
that written document

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.569
might be what solidifies things.

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:40.638
Having supports around updating
that document annually

00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:42.349
or whatever the timeframe is,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.339
that refresher on, okay, what is it?

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.509
Are we doing this?

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.190
Does this need to change?

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.999
Those are, I think, the parts
that are so important.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.259
The creation of it,
the thinking through it,

00:44:57.289 --> 00:45:04.189
the making a decision and getting
that in writing forces a real decision

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.190
to happen.

00:45:06.199 --> 00:45:07.248
Having a workshop,

00:45:07.249 --> 00:45:10.279
talking through things,
but not putting it in writing,

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.948
not documenting it can lead
to people not quite making

00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:17.120
that firm decision.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.689
When you have to fill out
that box that says,

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.690
who is it?

00:45:22.151 --> 00:45:24.443
You might be like, "Oh, we have someone."

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.529
Who is it when you have to write it down,

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:30.199
that forces you to make that decision.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:38.419
I think part of the question
was about what format.

00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:41.298
It can be any kind of format
and it can be,

00:45:41.299 --> 00:45:42.680
I think, really simple.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.980
No more than what you need.

00:45:46.459 --> 00:45:50.389
I think it is important to go
through the process of deciding

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.379
to write it down and then to look at
it later to have

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.829
someone actually look at it
and not just have it be,

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:59.120
"Okay, that happens.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.999
Now we're going to go back
to our old habits."

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.350
Same thing with the content maintenance
that I started with.

00:46:07.004 --> 00:46:08.869
People will slip into habits.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.069
How are you supporting any kind
of change you need to make?

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.109
You have to actively support that.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.570
<v Sherose> That makes a lot of sense.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:18.319
It makes a lot of sense.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.329
There's a lot of context
in what your audience is

00:46:21.413 --> 00:46:24.080
and what audience you're governing.

00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:25.970
What support do you have?

00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:28.400
Our next couple of questions

00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:33.123
bring us back a bit to high-level buy-in.

00:46:33.859 --> 00:46:35.991
One question asks
if you can make graphics

00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:38.575
with text accessible
or not use them at all.

00:46:38.635 --> 00:46:39.635
Another one asks,

00:46:40.219 --> 00:46:45.809
do you feel it's reasonably possible
to make an entire site 100% WCAG 2.1

00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:47.189
or 2.2 conformant?

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:50.150
I know that there
are different ways to make

00:46:51.189 --> 00:46:52.449
images accessible.

00:46:52.603 --> 00:46:58.249
If there's a static website has
the most chance of being 100% compliant,

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.872
but then we're also looking
at browsers and updated assistive tech.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.989
Really, I think it asks,
if you're asking for high-level buy-in,

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:12.469
if you're asking for resources,
how do you sell that?

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.259
How do you sell the project
that's never finished?

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:21.440
Or how do you sell a change
in design work that's already been done?

00:47:23.159 --> 00:47:27.889
<v Jeanette> Some great questions
or conversation starters.

00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:34.910
Going back to the first part
around images and text.

00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:39.110
The guidelines are, avoid images of text.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:47.570
I don't know of many examples
where you would want it.

00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:53.959
I think there's usually a better solution,

00:47:54.499 --> 00:47:58.460
but it is permissible
in certain situations.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.460
That's really a content thing

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.660
based on your content needs,
your goals, your audiences.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800
Typically,

00:48:11.299 --> 00:48:14.689
you can do it another way
than an image of text.

00:48:17.417 --> 00:48:20.479
Can a site be completely conformant?

00:48:20.919 --> 00:48:22.940
Can one?
Yes.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.740
Can your site?

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.390
Maybe not.

00:48:27.094 --> 00:48:30.469
100% is very difficult.

00:48:30.779 --> 00:48:36.888
Again, we had talked
about Level A, Level AA,

00:48:36.889 --> 00:48:37.999
Level AAA.

00:48:38.269 --> 00:48:43.879
Very unlikely that a site will be AAA,
fully conformant.

00:48:43.932 --> 00:48:47.359
AA is what most people are going for.

00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:54.530
That requires the content, the design,
that content maintenance to be on point.

00:48:55.276 --> 00:48:58.428
Because anytime you add content
or make a change,

00:48:58.429 --> 00:49:03.169
you might be, even if you are 100%,
you might be changing that.

00:49:03.799 --> 00:49:05.839
It's very difficult, I'll say.

00:49:07.879 --> 00:49:13.550
How I've talked about this with people
is there's no website that is bug-free.

00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:16.520
Because that doesn't make sense.

00:49:20.659 --> 00:49:24.319
No one has enough money
to fix every bug always.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:25.639
It's always changing.

00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:29.058
That includes accessibility bugs.

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:31.099
That includes usability bugs.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.180
That's why prioritization is important.

00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:39.034
That's why it's important to look
at real usability

00:49:39.526 --> 00:49:46.279
and have those real usability tests
and audits with different kinds of people

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.510
to make sure that your site is usable.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.869
That doesn't mean it's going
to be 100% bug-free or perfect.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.170
Also,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.289
the guidelines have wiggle room in them.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:04.158
There's different interpretations
and different people,

00:50:04.159 --> 00:50:06.895
different auditors,
have different opinions

00:50:06.918 --> 00:50:09.080
on what is a pass and a fail.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.012
That makes it extremely difficult
to say that's something

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.839
that's going to 100% pass.

00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:21.978
I missed some of the presentations
that talked about this,

00:50:21.979 --> 00:50:24.560
but I'm very curious
to see how this plays out

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:33.138
with the US ADA Title II DOJ,
because those are strong requirements,

00:50:33.139 --> 00:50:36.054
and I think they're very hard
to meet 100%.

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:40.700
90%, cool, but 100%, very difficult.

00:50:41.422 --> 00:50:44.520
<v Sherose> There's room
for liability, absolutely.

00:50:44.869 --> 00:50:46.789
We are almost out of time.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.949
I want to ask you one quick question.

00:50:52.519 --> 00:50:55.488
Do you have any
go-to tools you like to use

00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:58.670
for time-intensive tasks like
building an inventory or auditing?

00:50:58.879 --> 00:51:00.179
What are your go-to tools?

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:04.059
<v Jeanette> Screaming Frog.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.290
<v Sherose> [?]

00:51:10.646 --> 00:51:16.699
<v Jeanette> Screaming Frog is
the tool I've had most experience with,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.630
or the one that my company
typically uses to do a crawl,

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.310
come up with an inventory.

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:25.129
They have some different--
That is a paid tool.

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:28.099
That's, I think,
maybe the only one I know.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.763
Curious if other people have other ones,
but that's my answer.

00:51:30.763 --> 00:51:34.545
<v Sherose> We'll check the chat
and see what folks have.

00:51:34.546 --> 00:51:38.692
I believe Amber is here to close us out.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.630
Thank you so much, Jeanette.
<v Jeanette> Thanks.

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:48.560
<v Amber> Hello, everyone.

00:51:48.619 --> 00:51:51.260
I'm Amber Hinds,
one of the lead organizers

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.409
and a board member
for WP Accessibility Day.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.508
On behalf of the entire organizing team,
I want to thank you for participating

00:51:59.509 --> 00:52:02.924
in WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:07.339
This was our fourth WordPress
Accessibility Day event,

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.550
and the largest
that we have had in terms of attendees

00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:15.139
and the organizing team,
which is super exciting for us.

00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:23.449
This year, we had 2,448 registrants
from 79 countries.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.398
That's 300 more attendees
and nine more countries

00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:29.239
than we had last year.

00:52:30.499 --> 00:52:31.790
Behind the scenes,

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.210
there were 26 organizers and 22 volunteers
supporting 30 different speakers.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.672
Through funds raised during the event,
we were able to donate $2,800

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.869
to Knowbility,

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.310
our fiscal sponsor,

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:50.690
and a nonprofit that is focused
on website accessibility and education.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.729
Without our sponsors,

00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:54.530
this event wouldn't be possible.

00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:58.130
Their support enables us
to hire professional captioners

00:52:58.429 --> 00:53:00.466
and the American Sign Language
interpreters

00:53:00.466 --> 00:53:03.466
that we have all been enjoying watching
throughout the event.

00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:09.019
We also are able to pay our speakers
and cover the cost required to ensure

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:13.370
that the event is able to succeed
and operate on a year-round basis.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.099
Thank you to those sponsors.

00:53:16.383 --> 00:53:19.969
Our platinum sponsors,
20i, Equalize Digital,

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.170
and WP Engine.

00:53:21.919 --> 00:53:26.899
Our gold sponsors, GoDaddy,
GrackleDocs, Gravity Forms,

00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:29.120
GreenGeeks, TPGi,

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:30.530
and Yoast.

00:53:31.039 --> 00:53:32.060
Silver sponsors,

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.529
A11Y Collective,

00:53:33.889 --> 00:53:34.889
CodeGeek,

00:53:34.939 --> 00:53:38.900
Drake Cooper, EleMentor,
Overnight Website,

00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:41.359
Pressable, and Second Melody.

00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:45.859
We had 11 bronze sponsors,
as well as micro sponsors

00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:49.100
and individual donors
who were all critical

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.030
to making a difference in ensuring
that our ability to continue running

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.650
this event in future years.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:00.799
This year, we had 32 micro sponsors
and 101 people who donated

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.850
to support the event.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.009
To each and every one of you,
thank you so much for your support.

00:54:07.969 --> 00:54:12.078
Volunteers have generously given
their time throughout the event

00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:13.339
to emcee sessions,

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.015
handle the chat and Q&amp;A,

00:54:15.186 --> 00:54:17.987
and to keep the stream running
throughout the conference.

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:21.550
We very much appreciate
all of you volunteers who have helped

00:54:21.551 --> 00:54:24.079
to make the event happen,
but I especially want

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.590
to call out a few people
on the organizing team who stepped up

00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:28.910
in a big way.

00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:31.009
In previous years,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.999
one of my other lead organizers,
co-lead organizers,

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.300
Joe Dolson and I,
have gotten about two hours of sleep

00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:39.639
during the conference.

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:40.890
Last night,

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:47.628
I got about six hours of sleep,
in no small part to our new APAC team

00:54:47.629 --> 00:54:50.349
leads, Ricky Blacker and Ricky Onsman,

00:54:50.793 --> 00:54:53.637
and organizers Adrienne Grace
and Isla Waite,

00:54:53.889 --> 00:54:55.489
who very gracefully handled

00:54:55.550 --> 00:55:00.769
many challenges at a moment's notice
in the middle of the night for us.

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:06.139
I'd like to give them a round of applause
and all of our volunteers a heartfelt

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.719
thank you for how much
that they put into the event,

00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:12.469
both before and over the last 24 hours.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.729
Of course, thank you
to all of our speakers worldwide

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.290
who shared their knowledge.

00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:22.130
Every WordPress Accessibility Day,
I learn something new.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:26.178
Your dedication to teaching
others about accessibility is

00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:30.260
an essential contribution to building
a better web for all users.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.179
A few housekeeping items
before we leave you eagerly,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.456
I hope, awaiting WordPress
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.510
First, we want to hear your feedback.

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:45.349
We'll use your feedback
to help improve WP Accessibility Day

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.369
in future years.

00:55:46.639 --> 00:55:50.150
You can anonymously submit feedback
about the whole event

00:55:50.299 --> 00:55:53.359
or any individual session
on our feedback page.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:56:01.162
Feedback will be accepted

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.270
which is midnight on Friday for me
in US Central time.

00:56:06.199 --> 00:56:09.139
If you submit feedback,
you can also enter to win

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:11.420
a WordPress Accessibility Day t-shirt.

00:56:12.439 --> 00:56:13.699
Please go get started.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.079
Every feedback entry counts
as an additional entry to win t-shirts.

00:56:18.619 --> 00:56:22.069
We appreciate
every piece of feedback you send in.

00:56:22.999 --> 00:56:27.229
Sponsor swag and giveaways
are still open and new entries

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:30.859
will be accepted until midnight,
US Central time today.

00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:32.569
Towards the end of the day.

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:36.889
Sponsor pages have great discounts
and free goodies for attendees.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:42.631
Log in to our website
at 2024.wpaccessibility.day

00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:45.229
and please check out
what they're offering.

00:56:46.189 --> 00:56:48.589
If you want
to keep learning throughout the year,

00:56:48.799 --> 00:56:51.979
you can attend
the free WordPress Accessibility Meetups

00:56:52.369 --> 00:56:55.849
that are held twice a month via Zoom
with live captioning.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:59.031
Meetups are held on the first Thursday

00:56:59.032 --> 00:57:01.424
at 1500 UTC

00:57:02.204 --> 00:57:03.619
and the third Monday

00:57:03.859 --> 00:57:06.410
at 0 UTC every month.

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.344
You can find the group on meetup.com

00:57:09.345 --> 00:57:11.600
if you search WordPress
Accessibility Meetup,

00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:15.359
and we can probably throw a link
in the chat here in just a few minutes.

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:19.489
If you've enjoyed this year's event,
please consider getting involved.

00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:21.549
There are two ways that you can help.

00:57:22.249 --> 00:57:25.845
First, our translation team
led by Joni Halabi

00:57:26.085 --> 00:57:29.630
is actively translating video transcripts
into different languages.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:35.720
We are specifically looking for people
who can translate videos into Spanish

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:37.019
or French,

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.280
but we would, of course,
love translations into other languages.

00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:42.970
There are both paid,
I'll say that again,

00:57:43.018 --> 00:57:46.549
paid and volunteer
translation opportunities.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.569
Please learn more about translating
videos and apply to translate

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.250
at wpaccessibility.day/translate.

00:57:56.659 --> 00:58:00.559
Second, if you want to help organize
WordPress Accessibility Day next year,

00:58:00.859 --> 00:58:03.110
please fill out
our organizer interest form.

00:58:03.139 --> 00:58:06.710
You can find the form
at the bottom of the organizers page

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.059
on the event website.

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:12.348
Organizing is incredibly rewarding
and we would love to have you

00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:14.482
on the team in 2025.

00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:19.820
Thank you again to everyone for joining us
for WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.919
It's been a wonderful 24 hours.

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.620
I hope you've learned
something exciting and new.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:28.296
Watch your email for a notification
when the recorded videos are available

00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:29.296
in a few weeks

00:58:29.528 --> 00:58:32.840
and keep on working towards
building a more accessible web.

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:40.129
<v Announcer> Thank you to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024 sponsors.

00:58:40.669 --> 00:58:42.649
Platinum sponsor 20i,

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.678
easily build, deploy,

00:58:45.679 --> 00:58:47.930
with 20i managed WordPress hosting.

apps, sites, databases, security, DNS,

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:54.810
and email.

00:58:55.039 --> 00:58:56.269
Perfect for agencies,

00:58:56.330 --> 00:59:00.739
e-commerce, developers,
multi-site hosting and high traffic sites.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.470
Platinum sponsor Equalize Digital.

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:07.548
Since all they do is accessibility,
every post on their blog is

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:09.110
an accessibility resource.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.460
You can find webinar recordings,
articles, and additional resources

00:59:13.689 --> 00:59:17.148
at equalizedigital.com/resources.

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.939
Platinum sponsor WP Engine.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.469
WP Engine provides the most relied
upon and trusted WordPress products

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.130
for businesses, brands,
and agencies of all sizes.

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:32.695
