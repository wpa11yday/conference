00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.323
Announcer: 
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024,

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:06.608
Practical Text Accessibility Tips
for Content Creators.

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:10.044
The speaker, Alice Orru,
freelance content writer.

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:13.794
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:16.799
Marina Weis-Haggerty: Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:20.549
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:24.180
My name is Marina
and I'm a UX/UI developer

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.329
from the software agency, NuRelm.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.329
I'll be your emcee for this session.

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:33.576
Thanks, everybody, for joining us
for practical text accessibility tips

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.660
for content creators with Alice Orru.

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:41.240
Alice is a multilingual content writer
and translator with a penchant

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.331
for accessibility, software localization,
and WordPress.

00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.427
She writes and translates content
that describes the activity of freelancers

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:54.323
and WordPress companies in a transparent,
reliable, and inclusive way.

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:56.983
She joined the WordPress community in 2015

00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:00.045
and works with the Italian polyglots team.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.905
She co-authored the first handbook
in Italian on inclusive

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.821
and accessible writing for the web.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.686
Please feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:14.465
and we'll answer them at the end
of the session.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:17.882
Use chat to connect with other attendees.

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:20.541
That's it for all housekeeping.

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.741
All right, take it away, Alice.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:23.721
Alice Orru: Thank you.

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:27.138
Thank you, Marina, for this presentation.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:32.368
I wouldn't use the second slide
because it was actually my presentation.

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:34.823
Welcome, everybody.

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:35.694
Yes, I'm Alice.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.672
I'm Italian.

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:38.330
I use female pronouns.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.689
I've been living in Barcelona
for 12 years.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.279
All the rest professional thing,
Marina has already said everything.

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.612
What will we talk about
in this half-hour together?

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.536
About one of my passions,
accessible writing,

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:56.920
and how to apply it to our online content,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.504
particularly if you're involved

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:04.182
in creating text content on websites
and social media

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:08.283
We'll start with the principles
of accessible writing,

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:12.700
which, spoiler, are the same international
accessibility principles promoted

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.033
by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.

00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.060
They're simply declined
to the scope of writing.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.133
I will then give you
many practical examples

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.424
that you can put in practice right away.

00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:27.747
The examples I show you today, obviously,

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.160
do not cover all the techniques

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.870
we can put in place
to write in an accessible way.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.277
My goal here today is
to give you an understanding

00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:42.360
of what accessible writing is
and how many of the techniques

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:47.037
we already have
and there are at anyone's reach.

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:53.310
Every person who works with words
already has the power to do so much

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.894
to make the web a more accessible
and welcoming place.

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:03.318
First, what is clear
and accessible writing?

00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:08.051
We can define accessible writing
as one which is open

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.791
and usable by every person regardless
of their characteristics

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.957
and the technologies they use to read.

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.339
Who needs accessible writing?

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:24.160
Well, usually, the first people to come
to mind are people

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.482
with a visual impairment,
those with cognitive disabilities,

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:29.957
people with dyslexia

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:33.957
or with specific
neurodevelopmental conditions.

00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:38.959
We must also consider so many
other people with physical, cognitive,

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.189
and social conditions who can benefit

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.856
from these accessibility
writing techniques

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:49.919
such as people with a low level
of schooling, older individuals,

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.996
people who do not speak English
or your language as a first language,

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:59.428
people who have problems with anxiety,
stress, fatigue,

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:03.048
people who are in a hurry
and have little time to read

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:05.908
and assimilate the information
they're looking for

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:09.693
Basically, there's a very broad range
of people that can benefit

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:14.276
from the accessibility techniques
we'll discuss today.

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:20.514
Let us move to the heart of the matter

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:24.699
and take a closer look at the principles
of accessible writing.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.366
First, I need to give some news.

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:30.299
Content creators especially,

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:34.216
let's face it,
people don't read word by word.

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:39.588
They don't read anymore
in a linear fashion on the web.

00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:42.504
There are several reasons for this.

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.747
I invite you to read the Nielsen
Norman Group's research called

00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:49.247
How Users Read on the Web,

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:53.356
which reveals
that only 16% of people these days

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:56.566
read text on the web word by word.

00:04:56.873 --> 00:05:00.117
What's more, in this case study,
we also have to consider,

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:03.324
of course, all the people who read
with assistive technologies

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:05.824
that facilitate reading.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.356
Only 16% of people read word by word.

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:14.401
79% of people scan every new page
they come across.

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:19.137
They just scan it, don't read it entirely.

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:26.459
Let's see two examples
of how a web page can be read nowadays.

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:31.836
Here, we see a screenshot of an article
in the magazine It's Nice That.

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:36.022
The article is dedicated to the work
of the artist, Finnegan Shannon.

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:40.957
The cover image is one of the works,
a blue bench with a white inscription,

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:43.112
"It was hard to get here.

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:47.437
Rest here if you agree."
This is a nice and clean web page

00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:49.937
with a purple banner on top,

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.875
the name of the magazine
in its branded font,

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:55.541
the cover image, the main title.

00:05:56.798 --> 00:06:00.495
For some people,
focusing on a page with colorful

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:03.284
and different elements can be complicated.

00:06:03.284 --> 00:06:05.427
They get very distracted.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:07.950
The reasons for this can be physical.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.359
For example,
for people with partial vision

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:12.778
or a vestibular disorder,

00:06:12.778 --> 00:06:14.720
or also a cognitive reason.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.554
For example,
people with attention disorders.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.420
For these specific use cases,
browsers offer a reader mode,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.003
which removes all distractions.

00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:30.791
If I activate reader mode for the page
I just showed you on the previous slide,

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.791
the same article with a cover image,

00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:38.618
the formatting of the text
with different font sizes,

00:06:38.618 --> 00:06:40.603
has a whole different look.

00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:43.936
It is just text, plain text, with links.

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:51.660
Another example, the experience
of reading with a screen reader.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.571
Here, I'll use as an example a post
from Netflix's X account.

00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.909
This post promotes the animated film,
Spellbound.

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.409
The post caption reads,
"Two months until Spellbound,

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:08.444
so we got you this new pic
of Rachel Zegler."

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:11.497
Rachel Zegler is the actress
who will voice Ellian,

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.997
the protagonist of Spellbound.

00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:15.272
After the caption,

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:19.255
the post includes an image
from the film with the main character,

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:25.172
Ellian, sitting on a blue dragon,
opening her arms, happy and smiling.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.024
Okay, if I read this post
with a screen reader,

00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:34.028
and I've been using the built-in
voiceover on my Mac to do this,

00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:36.087
this is what appears on screen.

00:07:36.087 --> 00:07:38.860
When in use,
the voiceover reads the screen

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.590
and inserts the portion
of text it's reading into a box,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.256
a gray box at the bottom
of the slide here.

00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:54.533
You see the voiceover box on my Mac
describes the same text that I just read.

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:58.533
Also, it tells me data
of this post engagement.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:06.189
It says, "110 replies, 259 reposts,
662 likes, 60 bookmarks," et cetera.

00:08:08.542 --> 00:08:12.625
There is no mention
of the content of the image.

00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:17.625
This happens because the post lacks
the alternative text,

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.801
which we'll discuss in a moment.

00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:22.968
Right now, I want to point out to you,

00:08:23.043 --> 00:08:26.833
how the experience of reading
and enjoying the content

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:32.333
on the web page changed so much
when I read with a screen reader.

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:37.891
The four principles of accessible writing

00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:43.129
as well as those promoted
by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiatives

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:46.879
are summarized
in the acronym POUR, P-O-U-R.

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:52.247
Let's see them one by one.

00:08:52.247 --> 00:08:53.577
P of perceivable,

00:08:53.577 --> 00:08:56.682
which in the context
of writing is explained

00:08:56.682 --> 00:09:00.432
as people must be able
to read your content.

00:09:02.115 --> 00:09:07.698
O of operable, the content
must be well-structured and meaningful.

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:11.357
U of understandable,

00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:16.107
the content must be understandable
and easy to memorize.

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:22.559
R of robust, content must be compatible
with assistive technologies.

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:24.596
Now, let's look at them in detail.

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:28.892
For each of these principles,
I will give practical examples.

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:30.672
Let's start with the P.

00:09:30.672 --> 00:09:34.839
What is perceivable
when it comes to web writing?

00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.896
This means, for example,

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:41.229
providing text alternatives
for non-textual content

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.322
include captions and transcripts
for audio and video content,

00:09:46.322 --> 00:09:50.072
or use legible fonts
and sufficient spacing.

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:55.997
Alternative texts are one of the most
impactful writing tasks

00:09:55.997 --> 00:09:57.632
for content creators,

00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:00.882
both in terms of accessibility and SEO.

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.253
By alt text,
we mean the text that appears in place

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:10.140
of an image on a web page if the image,
for some reason, doesn't load.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.390
Screen readers use these alternative texts
to read and describe the image.

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:19.606
Who are alt texts useful for?

00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:23.099
People using screen readers
as I already said,

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:26.283
readers who want
to avoid distractions and read,

00:10:26.283 --> 00:10:31.171
for example, in read-only mode,
people with low internet connections

00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:33.741
that prevents images from loading,

00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:36.571
or people working on their SEO strategy

00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.746
because alternative texts
are crawled by search engines.

00:10:40.746 --> 00:10:42.910
Images with good alternative texts

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.910
are more likely to rank well
in Google Images, for example.

00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:53.685
Nowadays, almost all CMS
and social media platforms

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:58.268
include a field to enter alternative texts
for images.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:01.226
The field may be, more or less,
easy to find.

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:05.439
For example, Instagram recently
changed its location.

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:07.939
Nonetheless, it exists.

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:10.773
My advice is to go and see where it is.

00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:15.340
Remember to always manually write
your alternative text

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.840
when you upload images.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.474
Let's take our beloved WordPress.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:25.512
On the left side of this slide,
you can see an image from one of my blogs.

00:11:25.512 --> 00:11:29.120
When I'm writing a post
and I add an image blog with Gutenberg,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.504
I have to go on the right menu,
find the image setting area,

00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:37.588
and write the image description
in the alt text field there.

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:39.667
On Instagram, on the other hand,

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:44.091
you find the alternative text field
after uploading a photo.

00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:47.141
Before publishing it,
in the advanced settings menu,

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:50.367
there is the accessibility alt text field.

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:51.147
As an alternative,

00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:54.123
you can first publish the photo
and then edit it.

00:11:54.123 --> 00:11:55.104
Click on Edit.

00:11:55.104 --> 00:11:59.604
The edit alt text option appears
on the photo itself.

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:06.754
I personally love writing alt text
and you should learn to love it too,

00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:10.664
especially if you work
as a copy content writer.

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:13.629
In 2022, during WordCamp Europe in Porto,

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:17.313
I gave a workshop on how
to write effective alt text,

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:20.833
a nice one-hour lecture
that you can find on WordPress.tv.

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:23.243
Today, since we have much less time,

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:29.159
I will show you why it's important
to write alternative text manually.

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:31.784
Meta's social platform like Instagram

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:38.117
and Facebook can insert alt text
automatically if you don't do it manually.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:40.562
This, for the time being,
is not a good idea

00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:44.827
because their alternative texts
are not very accurate

00:12:44.827 --> 00:12:47.967
and do not always
describe images correctly.

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:50.467
Let me show you an example.

00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:53.913
A few weeks ago, I posted some pictures

00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:57.297
from a recent weekend in Madrid
on Instagram.

00:12:57.297 --> 00:13:02.838
One of them was a selfie of myself
taken at sunset in Retiro Park.

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:07.203
I'm wearing one of my favorite shirts
with blue and red flowers

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:11.792
and there's a beautiful pinkish light
illuminating my face.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:17.209
It was a very nice and happy moment,
more than we call it image.

00:13:20.012 --> 00:13:24.155
I wrote the image alternative text
clearly in the caption

00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:26.387
and I describe it like this,

00:13:26.387 --> 00:13:29.651
"Selfie of Alice,
a woman with a bob brown hair

00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.443
and a pair of large-rimmed tinted glasses.

00:13:32.443 --> 00:13:34.493
She wears a flowered shirt.

00:13:34.493 --> 00:13:36.779
The rosy light of sunset among the paths

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:41.304
of Retiro Park in Madrid illuminates
her smiling face."

00:13:41.304 --> 00:13:43.804
Okay, then I learned Instagram

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.740
and its AI filled
the alternative text field

00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:50.545
in the accessibility section.

00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:55.503
Here's what the artificial intelligence
saw and described,

00:13:56.318 --> 00:14:01.485
"Maybe a selfie of one person,
military uniform, and a park."

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.859
My beautiful flowered shirt
has become a military uniform

00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:10.500
I never owned
a military uniform in my life,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.699
so I was stunned
to see how the world changes

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:17.699
when we let machines
describe it automatically.

00:14:20.732 --> 00:14:24.726
Another area where the concept
of perceptible writing plays out

00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:26.990
is captions in video content.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.941
Adding them is a responsibility
we have as content creators

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.813
because they make our readers
accessible to people who cannot,

00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:36.339
for so many reasons, hear the audio.

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:40.317
We have to make sure
that these captions are readable.

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:44.188
Here, I bring you the example
of a creator I love very much,

00:14:44.188 --> 00:14:47.241
Nasim Lahbichi, @lahbco on Instagram,

00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:50.074
who makes beautiful video recipes,

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:52.017
but their captions are written

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:55.837
in a very small white font
in the middle of the video,

00:14:55.837 --> 00:14:58.043
as I'm showing in this slide.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:01.543
As you can see, they are mostly illegible.

00:15:03.828 --> 00:15:08.176
To find out all the best practices
in caption writing and formatting,

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:11.869
I refer you to a wonderful blog article
by Piccia Neri,

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.744
a UX designer who makes
a very comprehensive list

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:17.744
on how to write accessible captions.

00:15:18.052 --> 00:15:21.477
Here, I use the screenshot
of an Instagram video,

00:15:21.477 --> 00:15:25.310
a reel by an artist
I like very much, Alok V. Menon,

00:15:26.849 --> 00:15:30.932
to show you
what good captions should look like.

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:33.746
Write a short sentence at a time.

00:15:33.884 --> 00:15:35.732
Use sentence case.

00:15:35.732 --> 00:15:38.232
Avoid flashing effects.

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:41.453
Use a consistent layout for the words.

00:15:42.326 --> 00:15:45.493
And then prefer a simple sensory font.

00:15:49.577 --> 00:15:52.433
Use an eye contrast
between words and background.

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:57.600
As you see in this picture, black
text on a white background.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.001
Put your captions at the bottom
of the frame, but not too much.

00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:06.417
Try to adapt them to the social media UX.

00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:10.536
Speaking of social media posts,

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:13.536
I also want to mention that hashtags

00:16:13.763 --> 00:16:16.647
that are now a part
of our everyday communication

00:16:16.647 --> 00:16:20.832
on social media can be
and should be accessible too.

00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:24.256
This is a tweet from 2020
by Larene Le Gassick,

00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:28.673
showing the impact
of an accessibly-written hashtag.

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:35.075
The tweet says, "This is the difference
between a #aninaccessiblehashtag,"

00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:38.226
and all letters are written in lowercase,

00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:40.726
"and #VeryAccessibleHashTag."

00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:46.874
The initial letter of each word
that makes up the hashtag is capitalized.

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:51.041
"Another example,"
she says, "#blacklivesmatter,"

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.582
and all letters in lowercase,

00:16:53.582 --> 00:16:57.799
"versus #BlackLivesMatter,"
initial letters capitalized.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:01.225
She goes on with a last note
about the screen reader saying

00:17:01.225 --> 00:17:02.790
"number" and not "hashtag,"

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.425
that this may vary between screen readers.

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:10.425
The point is that to make hashtags
readable and accessible,

00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:13.470
remember to capitalize the first letter

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.636
and only the first letter
of the component words.

00:17:21.894 --> 00:17:27.006
Okay, let us now turn to the second letter
of the acronym for accessible writing,

00:17:27.006 --> 00:17:29.435
the O in operable.

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:33.486
The content must be well-structured
and meaningful.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.320
What does it mean for our writing?

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:40.496
Examples,
clear and explanatory page titles,

00:17:40.938 --> 00:17:45.354
conscious formatting of text,
descriptive link text.

00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:47.237
As a practical example,

00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:50.967
I bring you the Terms &amp; Conditions page
of Monzo bank,

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:54.906
a British online bank that places
great emphasis on accessibility,

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:57.406
both technical, textual,

00:17:57.621 --> 00:18:01.402
and also financial accessibility
for its users.

00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:05.333
The Terms &amp; Conditions page
is usually a difficult page to read

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:08.666
because it mostly contains legal jargon.

00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:13.907
However, Monzo bank Terms &amp; Conditions
page is designed

00:18:13.907 --> 00:18:20.323
to be understandable even to those
who are not familiar with legal language.

00:18:20.693 --> 00:18:24.509
I like this page because it has several
useful elements

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.009
that are easy to replicate.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.474
On the left, you can see the index,

00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:32.158
the table of contents
that helps you navigate

00:18:32.158 --> 00:18:34.839
through the document, which is quite long.

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:37.339
It is written in simple words.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:40.850
The emojis tone down
the seriousness of the page

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:46.183
and provide important visual support
that makes reading easier.

00:18:46.854 --> 00:18:50.336
The main text of the page consists
of short paragraphs,

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:54.594
each a few lines long,
well-separated by white space.

00:18:54.594 --> 00:18:59.088
Notice how white space
is an active component of the page.

00:18:59.088 --> 00:19:01.257
It's not just a simple background.

00:19:01.257 --> 00:19:03.485
We should use it like that.

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:06.901
The page titles are clear and meaningful.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.303
The anchor text of the links
are descriptive.

00:19:11.303 --> 00:19:16.749
This is also a topic that fully falls
under accessible and operable writing.

00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:18.831
Let me show you why

00:19:18.831 --> 00:19:22.209
Anchor text,
the text to which we attach links,

00:19:22.209 --> 00:19:25.125
must act as a guide for our readers

00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:28.030
They need to explain the purpose
of the link

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.542
and help the reader understand
what will happen when they click on it.

00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:35.625
They have to meet their expectations.

00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:41.337
Let's think about how links help us
scan the content of a page.

00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:45.847
First of all, because they stand out
visually compared to the rest of the text,

00:19:45.847 --> 00:19:50.077
good accessibility guidelines says
the link should appear underlined

00:19:50.077 --> 00:19:53.671
and in a different color
from the rest of the text

00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:55.703
Let's remember this rule.

00:19:55.703 --> 00:19:58.835
To write good anchor text for our links,

00:19:58.835 --> 00:20:02.335
we must think of them as stand-alone text,

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:07.440
microcopy without any surrounding text,
and ask ourselves,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.991
"Do they retain their meaning?"

00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:11.481
Unfortunately, even today,

00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:14.387
we fall into the temptation
of writing anchor text

00:20:14.387 --> 00:20:17.852
that are not very meaningful like,
"Click here,"

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:21.519
or simply "here"
as in these two sentences.

00:20:22.303 --> 00:20:28.220
The first says, "Click here," link,
"to read our data privacy notice."

00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:32.742
The second one says,
"Browse our data privacy notice here."

00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:35.992
I put the link only on the word "here."

00:20:37.386 --> 00:20:40.326
If we remove the surrounding text
from these links,

00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:43.621
we no longer understand
what is being talked about.

00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:46.862
From the first sentence,
I only read, "Click here."

00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:50.590
From the second sentence,
I only read "here."

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.711
This can become a problem for people
navigating the web

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.211
using assistive technologies.

00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:58.087
Screen readers, for example,

00:20:58.087 --> 00:21:01.491
allow users to access a site's navigation
directly

00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:04.574
from the list of links on a web page.

00:21:04.644 --> 00:21:09.723
Imagine the kind of list you would get
if all the links on a web page

00:21:09.723 --> 00:21:13.114
were anchored to generic and unclear words

00:21:13.114 --> 00:21:15.614
like "Click here," or "here."

00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:17.357
You completely lose the context

00:21:17.357 --> 00:21:21.024
and the sense of the page
you've landed on.

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:25.670
If, on the other hand,
I anchor my links to meaningful words

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.051
or group of words,
the result is very different.

00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.572
The two sentences
I wrote in this slide said,

00:21:31.572 --> 00:21:33.502
"Read our data privacy notice,"

00:21:33.502 --> 00:21:38.643
and all the words are linked,
or "Browse our data privacy notice,"

00:21:38.643 --> 00:21:41.227
and the final words are linked.

00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:46.248
These anchor links are rich,
meaningful, complete.

00:21:46.248 --> 00:21:48.095
They stand on their own.

00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:51.654
If I hide words that are not part
of the link's anchor text,

00:21:51.654 --> 00:21:56.737
it remains very clear what happens
when I click on the link.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.678
Okay.

00:21:58.678 --> 00:22:02.641
Now, let's move to the third letter
of our accessible writer acronym,

00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:04.969
the U for understandable.

00:22:04.969 --> 00:22:09.713
Our content must be understandable
and easy to memorize.

00:22:09.713 --> 00:22:13.473
Specifically, this means place
the main content of the text

00:22:13.473 --> 00:22:16.873
or a summary of it at the top of the page.

00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:21.873
Avoid unnecessary jargon and use
consistency in word choice

00:22:22.084 --> 00:22:24.584
and specific terms.

00:22:27.122 --> 00:22:30.248
For the concept of understandable writing,

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:35.582
I rely on all the practices
of plain language or plain English,

00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:37.467
which is the official website

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:40.180
for the US General Services
Administration,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.680
PlainLanguage.gov, reminds us,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.553
"It's the communication your audience
can understand the first time they read

00:22:47.553 --> 00:22:50.053
or hear it."

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:53.746
Plain language is the kind of writing
that puts reader first.

00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:57.872
It's based on clarity because it uses
straightforward language

00:22:57.872 --> 00:23:01.898
that is easy to understand,
common familiar words instead

00:23:01.898 --> 00:23:05.481
of complex or technical terms,
conciseness

00:23:06.699 --> 00:23:09.764
because it avoids unnecessary words
or jargon,

00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:12.879
focusing only on essential information,

00:23:12.879 --> 00:23:16.279
active voice instead
of passive voice preferably

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:19.530
to make sentences direct
and easy to follow,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.364
and simple sentence structure
to communicate effectively.

00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:30.092
A fantastic example is the content
of the website of the UK NHS,

00:23:31.169 --> 00:23:34.169
which is the national health system,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.707
which has been working
on accessible writing

00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:39.605
for several years with excellent results.

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:45.141
This, for instance, is the page dedicated
to urinary tract infections.

00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:49.090
A medical text, it could be difficult
for many people.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.045
However, the goal of the text is
that everyone searching

00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:57.467
for urinary tract infections
on search engines can land

00:23:57.467 --> 00:24:03.300
on a reliable page explained in a clear,
concise, and plain language.

00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:05.965
What do we notice here?

00:24:05.965 --> 00:24:07.954
The text is understandable

00:24:07.954 --> 00:24:11.257
because it is formatted
to be easily readable.

00:24:11.257 --> 00:24:13.069
The sentences are short.

00:24:13.069 --> 00:24:15.834
The bullet point list helps
to quickly scan

00:24:15.834 --> 00:24:18.417
the symptoms of the infections.

00:24:19.949 --> 00:24:22.415
The symptoms are described clearly

00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:24.044
because they are explained with common

00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:28.471
and familiar words for people
without medical experience.

00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:32.423
Words like "pee," "tummy pain,"
"feeling shivery"

00:24:32.423 --> 00:24:36.689
are used to describe the symptoms
in everyday words

00:24:36.689 --> 00:24:40.139
just as ordinary people do
when they describe how they feel

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:42.806
and don't master medical jargon.

00:24:46.984 --> 00:24:51.905
We have arrived at the last letter
of the principles of accessible writing,

00:24:51.905 --> 00:24:54.405
the R for robust.

00:24:54.783 --> 00:25:00.625
The textual content here must be
compatible with assistive technologies.

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:06.959
In particular, we must use semantic HTML,
ensure readability on any device.

00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:14.322
The expression, "semantic HTML,"
what does it mean?

00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:18.758
It refers to the use of HTML elements
that clearly describe their meaning

00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:21.508
and role in a web page structure.

00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:24.793
These elements provide both the browser

00:25:24.793 --> 00:25:29.710
and developers with a better
understanding of the content,

00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:34.124
but using semantic HTML
also improves accessibility

00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:37.593
for screen readers
and other assistive technologies.

00:25:37.593 --> 00:25:41.510
It also improves SEO
by helping search engines

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.150
to better understand the content.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.975
Why?

00:25:47.975 --> 00:25:50.706
If we are content creators,
content writer,

00:25:50.706 --> 00:25:53.956
why should we care about semantic HTML?

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:58.480
Well, actually, we still have
an interesting area of influence

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.396
when we write our text on WordPress
or other CMS platform.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.910
I give you the example
of the website of Piccia Neri,

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.216
the UX designer I mentioned earlier,

00:26:10.216 --> 00:26:15.175
because she perfectly combines
the concept of robust textual content

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:20.592
without sacrificing an aesthetically
pleasing visual experience.

00:26:22.231 --> 00:26:27.315
This is a screenshot of a web page
of Piccia Neri's website.

00:26:27.325 --> 00:26:32.825
I analyzed the website using
a browser widget called HeadingsMap.

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:38.425
This widget reveals the entire structure
of the page headings.

00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:41.175
On the left, you can see the menu

00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:46.479
with the heading structure created
by this HeadingsMap widget.

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:54.084
This widget allows me to see
at a glance that the page headings

00:26:54.084 --> 00:26:58.751
written by Piccia
follow the current heading hierarchy.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:02.216
They start with an H1, the highest level,

00:27:02.568 --> 00:27:04.721
which is also the title of the page,

00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:09.804
and then moving down to H2
with some H3s nested within them.

00:27:11.239 --> 00:27:14.090
The words used for the headings are clear.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.845
Allow me to understand at first glance
what the page is about.

00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:21.576
I can do a first reading of the page
and understand its contents

00:27:21.576 --> 00:27:24.826
just by scrolling through the headings.

00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:30.073
Use the headings to create
a meaningful outline of your page.

00:27:30.073 --> 00:27:32.573
You can nest the heading level

00:27:33.298 --> 00:27:37.055
if you have sub-items
of the headings above it,

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:43.555
but it's important not to skip headings
like do not jump from an H2 to an H4.

00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:46.896
There should be an H3 in the middle.

00:27:46.896 --> 00:27:51.329
This best practice translates
into a great advantage for readers,

00:27:51.329 --> 00:27:54.741
including those who use
assistive technologies.

00:27:54.741 --> 00:27:59.573
It's also a big plus for SEO
because respecting heading hierarchy

00:27:59.573 --> 00:28:02.990
is also highly favored by search engines.

00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:10.846
Speaking of aesthetically
pleasing visual experience,

00:28:10.846 --> 00:28:13.346
have you ever met fancy fonts?

00:28:13.481 --> 00:28:16.044
I bet you did, especially on social media.

00:28:16.044 --> 00:28:18.831
It is very common
to see social media posts

00:28:18.831 --> 00:28:22.723
where some phrases contain words
in fonts not native

00:28:22.723 --> 00:28:26.639
to the social platform
like bold text, italic,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:31.017
fancy fonts, gothic,
or modern font design.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.110
There's something for everyone.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.434
In this image, you can see a text of mine

00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:39.684
that I published on LinkedIn
for testing purposes.

00:28:40.523 --> 00:28:44.648
"Warning, this is a drill.
I repeat, this is just a drill.

00:28:44.648 --> 00:28:47.114
Here's a LinkedIn post
that will serve as a test

00:28:47.114 --> 00:28:51.123
during my talk at WordPress
Accessibility Days 2024.

00:28:51.123 --> 00:28:54.808
To make this post catchier,
I'm using a font generator

00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:57.891
to bold the date and time of my talk,

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:03.845
October 9, 2024 at 18:00 UTC,
20:00 Europe/Madrid time.

00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:11.058
The title of my talk is Practical Text
Accessibility Tips for Content Creators

00:29:11.058 --> 00:29:13.669
Yes, I used the font generator again

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:18.190
and selected the mono upper font
from the fancy category.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.200
Isn't it fancy, indeed?"

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.156
I then asked voiceover on my Mac
to read the text of this post

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:28.109
that I just read as I wanted to check

00:29:28.109 --> 00:29:32.660
how the screen reader reads the date
and time of the talk,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.743
which I wrote in a bold font,
and also the title of my talk,

00:29:37.907 --> 00:29:41.657
which I wrote in this fancy
mono upper font.

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:46.849
Okay, the result is that the very words
I decorated

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:52.233
with a bold fancy font generated
by an external site are ignored,

00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:54.733
are skipped by voiceover.

00:29:55.075 --> 00:29:58.875
The most important information
of my post are skipped

00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.312
by the screen reader.

00:30:00.312 --> 00:30:05.670
Assistive technologies don't get charmed
by decorations and special fonts,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.915
so they skip them in their stride.

00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:11.391
This happens because special fonts
are written in Unicode,

00:30:11.391 --> 00:30:14.178
a technology not supported by LinkedIn,

00:30:14.178 --> 00:30:17.678
nor any other social platform at this time

00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:23.158
If you want to write accessible, readable,
and understandable posts for everyone,

00:30:23.158 --> 00:30:28.075
you must avoid external font generators
to social platform

00:30:29.298 --> 00:30:31.698
because screen readers don't read them.

00:30:31.698 --> 00:30:35.678
They can be hard to read even
for sighted people.

00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:40.762
Sometimes they are not even searchable,
so not good for SEO.

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:45.269
I will conclude with another example
that will be familiar

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:51.176
to many people who regularly write
on social media or messaging apps, emoji.

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:53.194
Are they accessible?

00:30:53.194 --> 00:30:57.861
Yes, they can be,
but we need to use them with caution.

00:30:57.875 --> 00:30:59.703
In this slide, you see a screenshot

00:30:59.703 --> 00:31:06.370
from an old Netflix Italy post showing
close-ups of three TV series characters.

00:31:06.645 --> 00:31:10.483
Nick from Heartstopper,
Eric from Sex Education,

00:31:10.483 --> 00:31:12.561
Wilhelm from Young Royals.

00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:16.262
The caption of the post
is a long string of emoji

00:31:16.262 --> 00:31:19.595
in the shape of sparkles and red hearts.

00:31:20.052 --> 00:31:21.574
It's very cute.

00:31:21.574 --> 00:31:25.499
Emojis were clearly designed
to be self-explanatory,

00:31:25.499 --> 00:31:27.316
but there is a big problem.

00:31:27.316 --> 00:31:31.991
What happens when I use my voiceover
on the Mac to read these posts?

00:31:31.991 --> 00:31:36.824
The reader reports the series
of emojis with their label.

00:31:37.052 --> 00:31:40.779
Sparkles, sparkles, sparkles, sparkles,
red hearts, sparkles, sparkles,

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:43.279
and so on for six more times.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:47.020
As you can see,
for someone using a screen reader,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.520
this post is incomprehensible.

00:31:49.613 --> 00:31:52.113
There is no textual caption.

00:31:52.204 --> 00:31:56.287
The string of emojis doesn't convey
any meaning.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.750
Moreover, the alternative text is missing,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.703
which makes the picture accompanying
the post completely inaccessible.

00:32:04.703 --> 00:32:08.203
The meaning of the post vanishes entirely.

00:32:09.143 --> 00:32:14.355
What are the best practices
when we decorate our text with emojis?

00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:18.473
Don't overdo with them,
don't use them to replace words,

00:32:18.473 --> 00:32:22.640
and better place them
at the end of the sentence,

00:32:22.962 --> 00:32:26.629
spaced from the last word
of your sentence.

00:32:28.998 --> 00:32:31.728
With this final piece of advice, I'm done.

00:32:31.728 --> 00:32:35.362
I will leave you by saying
that as content writers and creators,

00:32:35.362 --> 00:32:38.158
we have the power to generate change.

00:32:38.158 --> 00:32:42.318
As people with privilege,
we have an obligation to do so.

00:32:42.318 --> 00:32:46.210
This sentence is inspired by one
of the first talks I saw

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:52.710
about accessible writing many years ago
done by a UX writer named Ada Powers.

00:32:53.737 --> 00:32:59.737
Thanks for the inspiration and thanks
to you for watching this session.

00:33:01.247 --> 00:33:03.747
[silence]

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:07.622
Marina: Well, thank you, Alice.

00:33:07.622 --> 00:33:09.362
That was incredible.

00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:12.362
All of your examples were fantastic.

00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:14.959
Alice: Thank you.

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:16.996
Marina: We have a lot
of really great questions

00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:21.913
in the Q&amp;A section
that I'd like to start to read for you.

00:33:22.165 --> 00:33:23.693
Just a reminder that, folks,

00:33:23.693 --> 00:33:27.811
if you do have questions,
you can put them in here

00:33:27.811 --> 00:33:30.977
Okay, so question number one from Rob.

00:33:31.814 --> 00:33:35.848
"We create maps
for transit buses for the public.

00:33:35.848 --> 00:33:39.030
What is the best way
to enter dates, times,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.280
directions if you use alt text
to describe a map?"

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.724
Alice: Well,
maps are very complex visual content,

00:33:47.724 --> 00:33:51.474
so I refer you
to a very incredible resource

00:33:52.244 --> 00:33:56.827
on the W3C website that is called
"alt decision tree,"

00:33:57.586 --> 00:34:02.389
which explains how to properly write
alt text for different types of images.

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:04.175
This is very useful

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.758
In general, for maps, the rule,

00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:13.512
the best practice would be to surely
describe the map in the alt text,

00:34:13.955 --> 00:34:19.803
but explain all the contexts of the visual
that we are seeing in clear,

00:34:19.803 --> 00:34:22.188
in the paragraph, in the page.

00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:27.567
Don't try to write like a romance
with your alt text to describe a map,

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:33.151
but use the rest of the page in clear
to explain what's happening,

00:34:34.387 --> 00:34:38.324
what we can see in the visual
because the balance

00:34:38.324 --> 00:34:41.573
between writing effective alt text
and alt text

00:34:41.573 --> 00:34:44.240
that are too long is a bit tiny.

00:34:47.063 --> 00:34:50.663
We have to find a nice balance
between the two things.

00:34:50.663 --> 00:34:53.639
If you have complex content to describe,

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:58.722
better to do that on the page
and not in the alt text field.

00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:00.693
Marina: Okay.

00:35:00.693 --> 00:35:05.443
I think this piggybacks off
of descriptiveness from Sam.

00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:12.244
"How descriptive should alt text be
for documentation and how-to posts?

00:35:12.244 --> 00:35:14.911
The images show navigation steps

00:35:15.694 --> 00:35:19.190
that are written
in the text above the image."

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.859
Alice: Okay.

00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:22.924
In this case,
I would avoid to repeat the same things,

00:35:22.924 --> 00:35:26.674
the instructions that we are given
in the documentation.

00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:32.007
Maybe I usually write alt text
like screenshots of this feature

00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:38.912
and then I will explain the features
in the content of the how-to post,

00:35:38.912 --> 00:35:40.072
for example.

00:35:40.072 --> 00:35:44.847
Let's try not to replicate the text
of the alt text in the instructions

00:35:44.847 --> 00:35:46.149
that were already given.

00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:51.063
Just imagine the alt text as part
of the reading experience of people.

00:35:51.063 --> 00:35:54.031
You don't want to read
the same sentence twice.

00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:58.781
That's the criteria
we should use when writing alt text.

00:36:00.093 --> 00:36:01.544
Marina: Great.

00:36:01.544 --> 00:36:04.044
This one is from Shauna.

00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:06.799
"What are the general guidelines you go by

00:36:06.799 --> 00:36:10.848
when deciding whether
to leave the alt text empty?

00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:15.176
If you have a page of people's mugshots
with their names under their photos,

00:36:15.176 --> 00:36:18.034
do you add their names
to the alt text too?

00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:21.878
When do you decide
to include gender or race or not?"

00:36:21.878 --> 00:36:23.103
Alice: Very.

00:36:23.103 --> 00:36:25.591
Marina: Yes, I had to think about how
to describe my headshot

00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:27.779
for this conference too.

00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:30.279
Alice: Exactly.
Marina: How descriptive should I be?

00:36:30.318 --> 00:36:32.661
Alice: Exactly That's a nice thing.

00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:38.828
The organizer team did let us describe
our pictures for today's streaming

00:36:44.357 --> 00:36:48.555
It's a very nice question
and also not controversial,

00:36:48.555 --> 00:36:50.402
but there is a lot of debate on it

00:36:50.402 --> 00:36:54.485
because the rule says
that decorative pictures,

00:36:56.199 --> 00:37:00.293
decorative images shouldn't be described
with an alt text,

00:37:00.293 --> 00:37:04.376
should stay empty
with the alt text field empty.

00:37:06.693 --> 00:37:09.758
There is also that criteria
that what is pleasable,

00:37:09.758 --> 00:37:14.424
what is enjoyable
as a decorative content on a web page

00:37:14.978 --> 00:37:21.478
for sighted users should also be enjoyable
for people with visual impairment.

00:37:21.629 --> 00:37:27.462
Again, the baseline here, the line,
the differentiation line is tiny.

00:37:29.033 --> 00:37:35.533
For example, if we are talking about
the little decorative images of an icon,

00:37:35.541 --> 00:37:39.424
which is already explained
in the rest of the page,

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:42.590
maybe we can leave the alt text empty.

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:48.234
In this case, you have people's mugshots
with their names.

00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:52.567
If this is useful in the comprehension
of the page,

00:37:53.153 --> 00:37:54.967
you can describe them as well.

00:37:54.967 --> 00:38:00.392
It really depends always
on the experience that you want to give.

00:38:00.392 --> 00:38:01.852
Also, we have different opinions.

00:38:01.852 --> 00:38:07.602
There are people who use screen readers
that are not interested in--

00:38:07.613 --> 00:38:12.696
I recently asked an accessibility
consultant for my website.

00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:20.590
He's a blind user
and he uses screen readers.

00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:24.131
He told me that he was not interested
in the description

00:38:24.131 --> 00:38:26.547
of my personal pictures in the About page,

00:38:26.547 --> 00:38:28.356
for example.

00:38:28.356 --> 00:38:33.308
It's just a matter of preference,
so it's very interesting.

00:38:33.308 --> 00:38:36.141
Also, the gender, race, et cetera.

00:38:37.922 --> 00:38:41.346
Again, if it's relevant
for the content you're writing,

00:38:41.346 --> 00:38:46.346
the place where you put in your image,
let's describe that.

00:38:46.463 --> 00:38:48.047
Marina: Great.

00:38:48.047 --> 00:38:50.547
Okay, next one from Andrew.

00:38:51.622 --> 00:38:54.671
"How far should stand-alone text
for links?

00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:58.563
For example, on a page of names,
should we have a link that reads,

00:38:58.563 --> 00:39:02.039
'Learn more about Joe,
learn more about the sun,'

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:06.705
et cetera, instead of links
that read, 'Joe, the sun'?"

00:39:07.162 --> 00:39:12.453
Alice: Okay, I imagine that this list
of names should be in a page named,

00:39:12.453 --> 00:39:15.392
for example, Our Team or About page,

00:39:15.392 --> 00:39:19.309
and then a list of all the people
of the team.

00:39:19.332 --> 00:39:24.832
This means that our links
are already placed in a page introduced

00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:29.232
by the word "About" or "Our Team."
The context is clear.

00:39:29.232 --> 00:39:33.934
It's not just a list of links and names
of people without any context.

00:39:33.934 --> 00:39:35.502
How far should we go?

00:39:35.502 --> 00:39:41.335
We should consider the context
of the links where we are seeing them.

00:39:43.956 --> 00:39:48.447
In this case, instead of linking,
"Learn more about Joe,"

00:39:48.447 --> 00:39:51.780
we could link only "About Joe" or "Joe,"

00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:55.862
because it's already clear
that we are speaking about people

00:39:55.862 --> 00:39:58.612
and we are listing them in links.

00:40:00.452 --> 00:40:02.952
Marina: Very interesting, yes.

00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:06.425
Okay, got some anonymous questions here.

00:40:06.891 --> 00:40:10.236
"Can you describe
if there are any big differences

00:40:10.236 --> 00:40:16.075
in what to do for accessibility
on regular web pages versus news posts?

00:40:16.075 --> 00:40:20.964
As far as writing type,
news posts tend to have long sentences,

00:40:20.964 --> 00:40:26.131
headings which have news headlines
versus regular web pages."

00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:30.610
Alice: That's interesting.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.360
I have not much experience
on news websites,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.441
but I can imagine
that the same principles apply here.

00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.341
If you are talking about a page
to be comprehensible,

00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:48.424
the content is designed to be scannable
by readers at first at a glance.

00:40:51.503 --> 00:40:55.253
I would use the same principle more
or less,

00:40:56.002 --> 00:40:59.168
but I have no much experience in this.

00:40:59.717 --> 00:41:02.133
I hope that the instructions

00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:07.471
that I gave you during this source
can be applicable also to news pages.

00:41:07.471 --> 00:41:11.599
We should prepare a webinar,
especially for that.

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:12.869
[chuckles]

00:41:12.869 --> 00:41:16.658
Marina: Right,
I think that was a good answer.

00:41:16.658 --> 00:41:23.074
Okay, "Do you have cutlines to enhance
accessibility for images and videos?"

00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:27.587
Alice: Cutlines?

00:41:27.587 --> 00:41:28.862
What does that mean?

00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:30.751
Marina: Cutlines.

00:41:30.751 --> 00:41:32.042
Actually, yes.

00:41:32.042 --> 00:41:36.209
Can anyone in the chat explain
what cutlines are?

00:41:38.456 --> 00:41:39.500
Maybe we can come back to that

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.483
because I don't know
if I've heard it either.

00:41:41.483 --> 00:41:43.513
Oh, captions. That's right.

00:41:43.513 --> 00:41:46.013
Alice: Ah, captions,
Marina: Maybe an older way to say it.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.453
Alice: Okay, sorry

00:41:48.453 --> 00:41:49.995
Do you use captions to enhance?

00:41:49.995 --> 00:41:51.107
Of course.

00:41:51.107 --> 00:41:54.607
Videos especially as I showed you
on social media

00:41:55.064 --> 00:41:59.648
or web pages in general,
captions are very important.

00:42:01.234 --> 00:42:04.484
Always use them because not everybody--

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:10.936
Of course, we have the deaf community,
which benefits from captions.

00:42:10.936 --> 00:42:14.035
Also, let's think about all the situations

00:42:14.035 --> 00:42:18.202
when people cannot hear
or listen to your videos.

00:42:19.142 --> 00:42:23.892
It's important to always have captions
on media content.

00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:32.784
Marina: "How do you check if a fancy font
is accessible or not?

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:37.784
What about fancy fonts
that are available on Google Fonts?"

00:42:38.095 --> 00:42:39.836
Alice: I was referring to fancy fonts

00:42:39.836 --> 00:42:43.920
that you can create
on external font generators.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.714
I was talking about them especially.

00:42:48.714 --> 00:42:51.714
If you google fancy font generators,

00:42:52.129 --> 00:42:58.329
you will find an incredible list
of many websites doing these decorations,

00:42:58.329 --> 00:43:00.345
creating decoration for fonts.

00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:05.511
In general, Google Fonts are accessible
as per my experience.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.331
If we choose Google Fonts,
it should be readable.

00:43:09.331 --> 00:43:11.502
It is not a Unicode.

00:43:11.502 --> 00:43:13.132
It's not a Unicode code.

00:43:13.132 --> 00:43:15.084
That's the skimming line.

00:43:15.084 --> 00:43:17.584
That's the differentiation.

00:43:18.374 --> 00:43:21.694
Marina: Got it. We're just going
through these questions rapid-fire.

00:43:21.694 --> 00:43:22.781
Great job

00:43:22.781 --> 00:43:24.807
[laughter]

00:43:24.807 --> 00:43:26.011
Marina: All right.

00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:29.837
Ashley asks, "Is it okay for buttons
to be more general

00:43:29.837 --> 00:43:32.894
like learn more if there is an alt text
on the button

00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:37.644
that is more descriptive
of where the button link goes?"

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:41.377
Alice: Is it okay for buttons
to be more general like learn more?

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:49.843
Well, I don't agree with that
because alt text is descriptive.

00:43:49.843 --> 00:43:55.177
The alt text will take its place
in describing the expectations

00:43:56.051 --> 00:43:57.357
when we click on the button,

00:43:57.357 --> 00:44:02.440
but also sighted user need
to have a good reader experience.

00:44:02.565 --> 00:44:08.315
General micro copies for buttons
are not a good practice in general.

00:44:10.204 --> 00:44:13.038
Try to be as specific as possible,

00:44:13.138 --> 00:44:16.471
as clear as possible with plain language

00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:21.418
to respect your readers
in general sighted or not sighted reader.

00:44:21.418 --> 00:44:22.798
It doesn't matter.

00:44:22.798 --> 00:44:27.279
Everybody has the right to be able
to scan a page right away

00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:29.779
and understand its meaning.

00:44:29.816 --> 00:44:33.408
Also, it always depends from the tone
of voice you're using in the content

00:44:33.408 --> 00:44:37.492
and your tone of voice,
your marketing strategy.

00:44:37.514 --> 00:44:40.086
Generally speaking, try to be as specific

00:44:40.086 --> 00:44:43.836
as possible for call to actions
and buttons.

00:44:45.952 --> 00:44:48.452
Marina: Great.

00:44:49.498 --> 00:44:54.002
I don't want to butcher your name,
so I'm not going to say it.

00:44:54.002 --> 00:44:58.252
"Alice, what is a fine balance
per your experience

00:44:58.765 --> 00:45:02.762
and expertise
between aesthetically pleasing design

00:45:02.762 --> 00:45:08.512
where client demands specifics
and those are non-negotiable for them

00:45:09.422 --> 00:45:12.256
or their brand and ensuring a11y?"

00:45:13.914 --> 00:45:15.497
Alice: Accessibility, yes.

00:45:15.497 --> 00:45:16.975
Marina: Accessibility, yes.

00:45:16.975 --> 00:45:19.559
Alice: That's a great question.

00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:23.864
I suggest you
to check Rian Rietveld's talk

00:45:24.973 --> 00:45:30.182
at WordCamp Europe a few months ago
at WordCamp Europe in Torino.

00:45:30.182 --> 00:45:33.978
Rian, who is an incredible WordPress
accessibility specialist,

00:45:33.978 --> 00:45:38.731
gave a talk on this and answered
exactly the same question.

00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:43.981
The balance between aesthetics
and accessibility is a concern,

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:50.047
but the answer is you can build
and write beautiful websites

00:45:50.721 --> 00:45:52.589
that are also accessible.

00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:57.339
We don't have to sacrifice aesthetics
for accessibility.

00:45:57.761 --> 00:46:01.711
I showed you Piccia Neri's website,
which is amazing.

00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:06.294
It's designed beautifully
and it's totally accessible,

00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:09.769
so you can totally do it.

00:46:10.946 --> 00:46:13.791
The difference is if you have
to convince your customers,

00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:17.791
sometimes this can be a hard point
to overcome.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.837
In general, if you collect nice use cases
of beautiful,

00:46:25.927 --> 00:46:29.264
accessible websites,
you should have enough material

00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:34.264
to show your clients
that the two things can live together.

00:46:36.092 --> 00:46:41.110
Let's try not to negotiate accessibility
for flashy effects,

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:46.610
animations, and all the things
that some clients think is a plus.

00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:47.768
It is not.

00:46:47.768 --> 00:46:50.154
We have to demonstrate them

00:46:50.154 --> 00:46:56.071
what happens when an aesthetically
pleasing website is not accessible.

00:46:58.258 --> 00:47:00.271
That should be our selling point

00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:05.355
How many customers we lose
when a website is not accessible.

00:47:05.382 --> 00:47:07.092
It's beautiful but not usable.

00:47:07.092 --> 00:47:09.366
It's beautiful but not accessible.

00:47:09.366 --> 00:47:13.532
That's also a nice selling point
for our clients.

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:16.131
Marina: Yes, indeed.

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:23.069
"Do you think sometimes we end up
giving people using screen readers

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:26.680
for access to content
rather than equal access?

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.589
How do you try to provide equal access
to everyone?

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:36.922
Alt text may give non-sighted users
more information than sighted readers."

00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:40.406
Alice: This is a nice question.

00:47:40.406 --> 00:47:46.322
I think that all the visual information
we get when we scan a website,

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.830
when we navigate through web pages,

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.821
so the visual inputs that we get,

00:47:50.821 --> 00:47:54.655
the audio inputs
that we get are information.

00:47:55.608 --> 00:47:59.775
There's no real imbalance
if we write accessibly.

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:04.043
There shouldn't be this imbalance
between sighted user

00:48:04.043 --> 00:48:06.876
and people with visual impairment.

00:48:09.582 --> 00:48:12.796
We can find the right balance, I think.

00:48:12.796 --> 00:48:15.031
Let's just think
that all the things that we can see

00:48:15.031 --> 00:48:17.865
and hear are added-up information.

00:48:18.575 --> 00:48:20.570
There should be no real difference.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:25.404
I don't know if I was clear,
if I answered your question.

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:32.977
Marina: I think someone had asked
if you could repeat the name of the--

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:36.954
was it the Pictionary website
that you gave as an example

00:48:36.954 --> 00:48:40.204
or if you gave a website as an example?

00:48:42.894 --> 00:48:44.076
Alice: Ah, Piccia.

00:48:44.076 --> 00:48:45.216
Piccia Neri.

00:48:45.216 --> 00:48:46.679
It's on my slides.

00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:49.846
You can find them linked to my slides.

00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:52.719
Marina: Okay, great.

00:48:54.259 --> 00:48:56.454
We have about two more minutes.

00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:59.836
Kayla asked, "We have stopped
using Read More buttons because

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:02.433
that text is not helpful
like you talked about.

00:49:02.433 --> 00:49:05.356
What about linking to portfolio pieces
or case studies,

00:49:05.356 --> 00:49:08.776
for example, that have an image,
heading, and a button

00:49:08.776 --> 00:49:11.549
The heading and image give context
where the button will go,

00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:13.867
but the button just says, 'Get details.'

00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:20.061
Is that text also too vague even
with the context of the heading before it?

00:49:20.061 --> 00:49:24.351
We want it to be actionable
to get people to click on these items."

00:49:24.351 --> 00:49:26.851
Alice: If this general text

00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:31.136
is well-placed in the context
of the web page,

00:49:31.198 --> 00:49:35.281
we don't have to demonize
all general microcopy.

00:49:36.213 --> 00:49:41.296
If it's readable and useful,
it's okay also if it's general.

00:49:42.606 --> 00:49:48.273
My point was let's build the whole context
of the web page in order

00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:51.418
for buttons to be useful and meaningful.

00:49:51.418 --> 00:49:55.579
If you already have a heading
and an image giving context

00:49:55.579 --> 00:49:56.945
and you wrote the alt text

00:49:56.945 --> 00:50:00.612
and all the language
of your page is clear,

00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:03.769
you can have a general button.

00:50:03.957 --> 00:50:08.957
It's not a strict rule,
but I hope it's clear what I meant.

00:50:09.691 --> 00:50:11.349
Get details.

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:14.849
It can be okay if the context is coherent.

00:50:17.249 --> 00:50:18.490
Marina: Great.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.792
All right.

00:50:19.792 --> 00:50:22.292
Well, thank you so much-

00:50:22.538 --> 00:50:23.432
