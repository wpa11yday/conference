00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Announcer> WordPress Accessibility
Day 2024.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.429
Same editor, same language.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.689
How Gutenberg's accessibility
enhances creativity and inclusion.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.559
With speakers Elena Brescacin,
Accessibility Consultant

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.699
at Tangity Design,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.822
NTT Data Italy, and Gloria Liuni,
Web Designer at Gloweb.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.762
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Yigakpoa Ikpae> Hi, everyone.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.510
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:35.703
My name is Yigakpoa Ikpae
and I am COO from Planned Africa.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.490
Thank you so much
for joining us for Same Editor,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.659
Same Language.

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:44.640
How Gutenberg's accessibility
enhances creativity and inclusion,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.880
with Gloria Liuni and Elena Brescacin.

00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:51.529
Gloria is a freelance web designer
who has been passionate

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:53.732
about WordPress since 2009.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029
She's involved in the WordPress community

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:59.789
as the moderator
of the Italian Support Forum,

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.510
organizer of local WordCamps,
and organizer of Turin WordPress Meetup.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.929
She has been a speaker
on several occasions,

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.239
promoting the use of Gutenberg.

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:18.103
She likes to experiment
with the new FSC full site editing system.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.169
She teaches the use of WordPress
with easy and kind words.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.079
She loves taking long walks with her dog.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.010
Elena works as an Accessibility
Consultant at Tangity,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.880
a NTT data design company.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.599
Totally blind since birth,
her passion for technology

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.470
allows her to find best solutions
to everyday lifestyle

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.940
that she doesn't own, or at least know.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.960
Other hobbies include playing chess,
word games,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.108
true crime podcasts,
and she maintains a blog

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.013
together with an HIV positive friend
where they invent stories

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.989
against HIV stigma.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:03.540
Please fill your questions
in the Zoom question and answer section.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.220
I will answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:09.839
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.799
<v Gloria Liuni> Okay.

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:17.812
So, let's go.

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:19.072
Start.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.660
Hi, everyone.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.560
I'm Gloria and my co-presenter is Elena.

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:30.154
Our first connection,

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.391
Elena and Gloria.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.371
My connection to social network
is not constant,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.590
but one day I was lucky to find
a very interesting content.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.910
Elena replies
to the Facebook support group

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.850
and her contribution inspired me.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.849
The Gutenberg editor
had only been introduced a few years ago

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.200
and many people
still preferred not to use it.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.015
Meeting a blind person
who instead found Gutenberg

00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:09.510
an important resource was exciting.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.491
So, I contacted her in DM
and pushed her to apply

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:18.101
as speaker
for the next WordCamp Italia.

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:22.587
Elena.

00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:31.195
<v Elena Brescacin> I have been very,
very surprised to be invited to WordCamp.

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:37.740
I was just replying to the support request
into Facebook about

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.540
one of many Italian support communities.

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:48.668
It's called SOSWP.

00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:51.509
It's an Italian community

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.258
that makes business by WordPress support,
and she invited me to speak

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.619
to that WordCamp.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.832
I could say,
what could I do in that field?

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:12.660
Because I was very,

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.690
very rusty in the use of WordPress.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.990
I was very, very, let's say,
rusty because I did not know

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680
what to do.

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.259
Gutenberg was quite new for me,

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:34.529
but I already discovered it
was accessible via keyboard,

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:45.883
so I caught the chance
and I spoke to the WordCamp.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.919
Gloria has believed in me

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.149
and I took it to the next level,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.084
bringing to the WordPress 2021
online WordCamp.

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.563
Explaining how Gutenberg
was used as a content editor

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:10.252
through Markdown syntax.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.479
It was very, very easy.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.010
I just pasted Markdown files
into the editor

00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:26.657
and it automatically processed
headings, titles, links, etc.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.690
I had superpowers then in editing files

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.020
and I was pleased
to share it with the public.

00:05:43.732 --> 00:05:45.172
<v Gloria> Full site editing.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:52.694
So, full site editing will change
how everyone uses themes

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.442
and how we build them,

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.448
but what is full site editing?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.909
Site editing is
a set of new WordPress features

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.910
that help us build and edit
all parts of our website using blocks.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.509
Site editor, global styles, block themes,

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:15.839
patterns, and theme.json.

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:22.290
Fullsiteediting.com is
an educational resource for learning

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.674
about the features.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.206
I have been following Project Gutenberg
for several years.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.909
On a theoretical level,

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:36.990
I also follow the introduction of the FSE.

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:40.799
The first time I used it for real

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.050
was the realization
of the WordCamp Torino 2023 website.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:55.709
Then I gave a speech at Verona 2023
on how to take the first step with FSE.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:07:03.269
Finally, I was part
of the WCEU 2024 website team

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.279
and I learned to practice templates
and then blocks very well.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Elena.

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:20.362
<v Elena> So, I heard about full site editing
in the online WordCamp 2021,

00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.447
where I was a speaker.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.836
Being charmed by Gutenberg,

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.198
I was very, very enthusiastic
of this further step,

00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:37.470
but it was not ready then.

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.282
I was using

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.380
another theme,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.020
another template system
that was called GeneratePress

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.129
and it was very, very basic.

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:52.767
I did not care about layout

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.590
and so on,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.820
but I had in mind
to switch sooner or later.

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:08.617
In the years 2022
and 2023, in the meanwhile,

00:08:08.893 --> 00:08:11.796
full site editing came out of beta stage

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:17.520
and I started to see
what it was all about.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:24.076
Then the make.wordpress.org
accessibility rule

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:31.177
provided information about WordPress
backend being accessible,

00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:38.418
core WordPress backend
being accessible and second level WCAG.

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:42.011
I was enthusiastic

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:51.983
because I saw that I could build one
interface like it was,

00:08:54.022 --> 00:08:58.973
let's call it like bricks,
like Lego bricks.

00:09:00.092 --> 00:09:04.164
I could move elements around and so on.

00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:09.293
I was lost because I did not know
about how to use it.

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:13.213
I needed advice, I needed suggestions.

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:16.273
I just tried to work,

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:22.144
to consult the fullsiteediting.com website
by Carolina Nymark,

00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:24.364
sorry for the pronunciation.

00:09:25.034 --> 00:09:32.989
I did not find sufficient help
because it had no accessibility support.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:40.134
I just took the chance to say
that it should be done,

00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:46.753
one section dedicated
to creators with disability

00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:50.307
into the Learn WordPress area.

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.241
<v Gloria> Okay, next.

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:58.879
We often use a page builder

00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:00.439
in the backend,

00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:06.188
but the page builders
are accessibility, Elena?

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.208
<v Elena> Well, this is the question.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.880
If page builders are accessible or not.

00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:15.311
A page builder,

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:16.329
a site builder,

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:19.169
as a definition, is very, very complex.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:29.368
It's a very, very complex environment
compared to the normal frontend reading

00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:31.588
information and basic interaction.

00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:34.139
I tried many of them.

00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:40.169
Elementor, Divi, SiteOrigin page builder.

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:48.028
Now I think Gloria is showing
the equalized digital report

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:54.687
by an Excel file where the approach
of various page builders

00:10:54.688 --> 00:11:02.120
has been treated in this Excel.

00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.229
What's the big deal?

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:08.911
It's because this report
is about frontend.

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:18.989
I mean, what developers can do
to make a frontend accessible,

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:22.709
but as far as I know,

00:11:22.768 --> 00:11:25.709
there is no report,

00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:33.268
no documentation on how backend
is in accessibility,

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:35.248
how Elementor,

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:41.008
Divi and so on are facing
the authoring tool

00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:42.959
and accessibility guidelines.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:46.199
Gutenberg is the best I have found

00:11:47.098 --> 00:11:50.869
because you can do everything by keyboard.

00:11:55.228 --> 00:11:56.590
I tried Elementor,

00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:03.899
I tried Divi, I tried everyone,
but no one was satisfying me.

00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:11.398
I even found once
the SiteOrigin page builder.

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:13.258
I think that was the name.

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:18.762
It was declaring it was accessible,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.749
priority accessible,

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:32.323
second priority WCAG accessibility,
but it just had tabindex elements.

00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:38.847
You reached everything by tab,
but you had no heading,

00:12:38.848 --> 00:12:45.019
no semantic HTML or semantic code
to indicate that it was accessible.

00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:46.268
In the end,

00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:53.249
I said bye-bye and waited
for better times,

00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:54.308
and in fact,

00:12:54.749 --> 00:13:00.749
it has come with Gutenberg
and now I am satisfied by Gutenberg.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:05.648
<v Gloria> Thank you, Elena.

00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:08.458
<v Elena> Sorry, the Excel, I was forgetting,

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:11.819
is coming from Equalize Digital.

00:13:15.538 --> 00:13:18.158
I think in their site you can find--

00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:22.340
If blind people
or someone you want to see,

00:13:22.341 --> 00:13:28.637
they can find Equalize Digital
accessibility page builder report

00:13:28.638 --> 00:13:30.388
or something like similar.

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:33.579
<v Gloria> Perfect.

00:13:34.558 --> 00:13:39.389
Now, the core, teacher-student double
learning experience.

00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:42.269
What's your experience, Elena?

00:13:44.038 --> 00:13:47.801
<v Elena> Well, as I said,

00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:50.479
my relationship

00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:54.238
networking with Gloria has been

00:13:55.798 --> 00:14:01.889
based on each other's mutual trust
and believing in each other.

00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:05.649
She has believed in me
when I spoke to WordCamp,

00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:11.458
and I could believe in her
about full site editing.

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:17.642
She spoke at WorldCamp
Verona last year, 2023,

00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:24.508
and I had a speech also
into the WorldCamp that was called Blind,

00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:26.499
Blog, Independent.

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:32.849
I created the word blind
by blog and independent.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:44.493
Then I knew that full site editing
was out of beta stage.

00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:50.008
I asked her for help
because as I said before,

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:51.009
I got lost.

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:56.254
I got lost because it was not just
the basic interface on Gutenberg.

00:14:57.449 --> 00:15:02.699
My worst experience was
because when I changed from GeneratePress

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:04.621
to 2024 default theme,

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:06.959
all my menus disappeared.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.040
I found the page

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:15.298
was switched to a default one,
was that I have lost everything.

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:20.338
So I asked, "Please, Gloria, help me.

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:22.528
If you can teach me

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:25.918
the interface and so on."

00:15:27.338 --> 00:15:30.715
Gutenberg is accessible,
has a screen reader support,

00:15:30.716 --> 00:15:36.658
so we can take each other hand by hand
and we will help.

00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:38.108
I thought

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:45.838
she could be afraid of this experience,
but in the end it went very,

00:15:45.868 --> 00:15:46.868
very smooth.

00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:50.369
Now I let her express her point of view.

00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:58.319
<v Gloria> Okay, teaching
a blind person has been challenging

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:04.115
because I had to change my method,
replacing the graphic symbols

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:06.239
explanation with the text names.

00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:10.768
For example, instead of back arrow,

00:16:12.342 --> 00:16:16.138
I had to say, press the button named back.

00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:22.679
I could not use terms
that were familiar to me,

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:27.568
like hamburger menu for example.

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:31.557
<v Elena> The pencil.

00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:32.867
She told me editor--
<v Gloria> No, no.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:39.384
Maybe I show the back end.

00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:40.385
I lost.

00:16:41.628 --> 00:16:44.070
I'm exciting and I'm lost.

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:56.048
Now I found the hamburger menu.

00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:00.398
I repeat.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.019
Hamburger menu,

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:06.028
which corresponds

00:17:06.702 --> 00:17:08.129
to menu action,

00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:14.339
or another terms--

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:28.928
Sorry, I don't found the--

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:35.470
Okay, fine, or the pencil icon.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.668
The pencil icon which corresponds
to edit element.

00:17:39.282 --> 00:17:43.228
This term I could not use.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:50.059
One of the difficulty was
that the screen reader detect content

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:59.428
that I could see on the screen
because it was above the fold.

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:08.668
I therefore had to ask Elena
to move the tab so that I could see

00:18:08.728 --> 00:18:10.079
what she was doing.

00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:17.549
The glossary.

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:24.989
To prepare a glossary accessible
to both blind and sight people

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:27.179
required discussions.

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:32.649
What worked for Elena
did not work for me and the opposite.

00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:38.699
Now Elena tells you
which compromise we found.

00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:41.569
<v Elena> Yes.

00:18:42.658 --> 00:18:45.459
Let me say that I have tried

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.738
many strategies for the glossary.

00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:51.779
I used the plugin,

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:57.688
the Code8 was the pronunciation,
plugin glossary,

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.399
but it did not satisfy me,

00:19:03.569 --> 00:19:06.658
especially for back end accessibility.

00:19:07.288 --> 00:19:12.619
It's not so accurated,
accessibility of its back end.

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:19.289
I said I want to create a simple one,
a page with terms and so on.

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:25.799
The problem came because I needed
to place the navigation letter,

00:19:25.946 --> 00:19:27.726
the alphabet letters.

00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:33.479
For me, it was very functional
to have a list of letters before.

00:19:36.257 --> 00:19:37.799
The first element could be

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:40.017
the navigation letters,

00:19:40.018 --> 00:19:46.563
then all the terms and that's all.

00:19:46.965 --> 00:19:50.010
Headings, one heading
level two for the letter,

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:54.519
and one heading level three
for the corresponding term.

00:19:55.019 --> 00:20:04.918
With after each term a back to menu link
to go back to the navigation.

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:09.814
If it could be functional
for screen reader users

00:20:09.864 --> 00:20:14.808
because it was easy to jump among
the links and the headings.

00:20:16.068 --> 00:20:17.419
For a sighted person,

00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:18.478
the experience

00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:26.929
was not friendly at all because you had
the screen going back and forth,

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:29.628
changing the page,

00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:37.727
and the glossary could be very important
to understand the technical terms

00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:41.408
to not create misunderstandings and so on.

00:20:42.168 --> 00:20:53.058
It had to be a friendly experience
for both target audience.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:56.267
So me and Gloria,

00:20:56.268 --> 00:21:02.208
I had to explain her screen reader logic,

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:09.138
and that's why I called
my speech Same Editor,

00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:10.161
Same Language,

00:21:10.218 --> 00:21:15.628
because Gutenberg has
the same structure of a screen reader.

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.039
If you have, for example,

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:20.208
the blocks list view,

00:21:21.307 --> 00:21:23.989
you will see that it's a tree structure.

00:21:25.248 --> 00:21:27.228
If you have the column group,

00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:30.078
you have column one

00:21:30.978 --> 00:21:34.458
and under column one there is column two.

00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:37.609
I had no trouble to tell Gloria, look

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:44.779
the logical order is not correct
because you have column one

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:46.879
with the content of the page,

00:21:47.448 --> 00:21:52.999
with terms and actual words

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.529
and then you have letters.

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:56.769
It makes no sense

00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:02.268
because I want to I have
to read first the letters,

00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:05.812
the navigation and then the terms.

00:22:09.019 --> 00:22:11.304
What Gloria did was helping me

00:22:12.618 --> 00:22:17.358
to have a right sidebar,
a sidebar to the right side,

00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:22.285
a fixed sidebar
to the right side, and a content,

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:26.718
a duplicated menu with letters

00:22:27.968 --> 00:22:30.394
before the glossary term.

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:36.408
It's limited
because it has not the search field

00:22:36.948 --> 00:22:41.808
and other features,
but for few terms that they are,

00:22:42.009 --> 00:22:49.430
I did not invest too much time
to do such an effort.

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.455
<v Gloria> Perfect.

00:22:56.643 --> 00:23:01.841
Another task.

00:23:05.474 --> 00:23:08.173
Query loop organized page.

00:23:18.795 --> 00:23:20.650
The query loop,

00:23:24.414 --> 00:23:27.918
all of the display of the latest article.

00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:32.448
It's also possible
to add a filter to select

00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:35.779
the latest article of a specific category.

00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:46.789
The query loop is the method used
to show the content dynamically.

00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:50.869
Elena has a story split in chapters

00:23:51.408 --> 00:23:54.948
and we needed to show it in order.

00:23:55.459 --> 00:23:57.479
This is the quest.

00:24:00.152 --> 00:24:01.190
Go, Elena, go.

00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:11.381
<v Elena> Gloria is showing the story
of the screen of how we implemented

00:24:11.382 --> 00:24:12.082
the feature.

00:24:12.113 --> 00:24:14.592
Well, in this case,

00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:19.192
we noticed one important,
let's call it gap,

00:24:19.452 --> 00:24:22.368
wall, barrier, let's call it as you want.

00:24:23.508 --> 00:24:27.919
Because if sighted people

00:24:29.058 --> 00:24:34.519
do not understand completely
how a blind person can reason

00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:38.118
while navigating a page,

00:24:39.598 --> 00:24:43.908
it's valid the opposite as well.

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:46.608
That is, well,

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:51.439
I was born blind
and I could study whatever I want,

00:24:51.498 --> 00:24:53.208
but I will never know

00:24:55.009 --> 00:25:06.288
for sure and mathematically certain
what a sighted person wants,

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:10.819
likes, and what is
the best user experience

00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:12.499
for a sighted person.

00:25:13.338 --> 00:25:17.748
What I created was
a query loop with a pager,

00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:23.118
the long introduction to the story,
characters and so on.

00:25:24.498 --> 00:25:28.698
Then my plan was to have 10 chapters

00:25:29.209 --> 00:25:31.896
or 5 chapters, whatever, then pager,

00:25:31.998 --> 00:25:32.998
next page.

00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:38.148
Unfortunately, I used my point of view.

00:25:39.138 --> 00:25:44.987
I said there are jumping elements,
there are the skipped main content,

00:25:44.988 --> 00:25:46.804
there is the headings,

00:25:46.805 --> 00:25:49.069
there are links,

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:53.327
there are the possibility
to find text in a page,

00:25:53.328 --> 00:25:55.844
everyone could jump the introduction.

00:25:56.313 --> 00:25:59.717
A sighted point of view said no,

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:06.318
it's not true because when you skip
to another page

00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:08.794
to read next chapters,

00:26:10.343 --> 00:26:15.499
you have again
all the long page of introduction

00:26:16.278 --> 00:26:18.709
and it's not a good user experience.

00:26:19.337 --> 00:26:25.188
The readers just close
the window and skip,

00:26:25.189 --> 00:26:27.078
keep your story for yourself.

00:26:30.158 --> 00:26:34.398
What we did was to find
a compromise that is

00:26:35.089 --> 00:26:38.267
the query loop is set

00:26:38.778 --> 00:26:40.248
to order,

00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:43.638
to sort the story alphabetically,

00:26:45.888 --> 00:26:53.508
from 01 to 20, to let it go,
as there are 20 chapters.

00:26:55.629 --> 00:26:59.029
Every chapter is displayed
with its summary

00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:00.599
in a list,

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:09.798
and there is an anchor link skipping
the introduction.

00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:18.648
Then into the internal chapter,
into the every single story chapter,

00:27:21.018 --> 00:27:26.418
we just placed the navigation
block previous and next,

00:27:26.418 --> 00:27:33.259
filtered by the taxonomy term
concerning the specific story.

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:40.189
<v Gloria> Okay, you write very much.

00:27:43.598 --> 00:27:48.949
We are in the backend
of the template for this content

00:27:49.498 --> 00:27:52.977
and like Elena says,

00:27:52.978 --> 00:27:57.258
we used a private next Gutenberg block

00:27:57.739 --> 00:28:03.558
and filtered the results by taxonomy.

00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:13.598
We can read every chapter
of the story one by one.

00:28:18.131 --> 00:28:19.131
Perfect.

00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:25.213
Next, typography and headings.

00:28:26.209 --> 00:28:27.618
Return to glossary.

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:33.049
One day I noticed
that the headings text of glossary

00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:37.189
was unreadable, too small.

00:28:38.328 --> 00:28:42.559
To understand what happened,
we had to work together.

00:28:43.718 --> 00:28:44.718
Synchronized.

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:48.889
I placed the correct size
in the glossary headings,

00:28:49.088 --> 00:28:53.558
but when Elena added new terms,
the problem was there again.

00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:59.299
I followed her movements
on screen until I noticed

00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:04.999
that the tabbing of typography settings,
the small option selected automatically

00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:06.648
when focused.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.099
You turn, Elena.

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:13.859
<v Elena> Yes.

00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:21.234
I'm afraid, I fear
it's a long-lasting Gutenberg bug,

00:29:22.009 --> 00:29:26.897
because when you write a block,
a paragraph or a title

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:31.339
or whatever block
which supports typography,

00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:33.409
then you move

00:29:33.979 --> 00:29:38.512
with the tab key
to reach the block settings.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.686
When you are
in interaction mode screen reader,

00:29:47.178 --> 00:29:54.469
because I explained, Gloria,
that screen readers have mostly two modes.

00:29:55.778 --> 00:29:59.954
Browse mode or virtual cursor
or navigation mode,

00:29:59.984 --> 00:30:01.818
every screen reader has its name,

00:30:02.478 --> 00:30:08.449
and interaction mode
that lets interact with elements

00:30:09.406 --> 00:30:10.406
directly.

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.959
In interaction mode,

00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:21.900
when I press the tab
to the text size settings,

00:30:22.272 --> 00:30:29.164
the first radio button
regarding the text settings,

00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:37.978
gets switched on, unrequested,
just by placing the focus on it.

00:30:40.169 --> 00:30:47.338
I assumed it was normal behavior,
that the small was the default size,

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:49.409
and I left it like that.

00:30:52.258 --> 00:30:54.929
Then, Gloria has,

00:30:56.069 --> 00:31:01.927
thanks to the synchronized cooperation,
we just discovered

00:31:01.928 --> 00:31:07.348
that it's a possible error, and maybe

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:10.909
to reset the settings,

00:31:11.206 --> 00:31:18.276
we had to revert the block setting
to the default size.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.660
<v Gloria> Perfect.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:34.210
Last but not least,
last challenge has been

00:31:34.261 --> 00:31:37.408
to create a website English version

00:31:38.219 --> 00:31:42.868
without plugins,
because multilingual solutions,

00:31:43.138 --> 00:31:44.548
just like page builders,

00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:48.299
often do not consider
accessibility support.

00:31:49.417 --> 00:31:54.190
Based on WorldCamp Torino 2023
site realization

00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:56.805
in Italian plus English,

00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:59.264
we created templates and pages.

00:32:00.689 --> 00:32:05.090
Currently FSE does not support
template duplication,

00:32:05.548 --> 00:32:11.129
so we had to copy and paste
every single block from a template

00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:12.219
to another.

00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:17.428
We have added basic languages
which functionality

00:32:18.118 --> 00:32:25.078
Italian and English flags point
to corresponding home page,

00:32:25.438 --> 00:32:27.899
Italian and home page English.

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:37.048
The real challenge came
when we decided to add a search field,

00:32:37.558 --> 00:32:42.328
because by default WordPress searches
within all its content.

00:32:43.138 --> 00:32:47.038
We tested a few plugins,
but the ones that had

00:32:47.101 --> 00:32:51.178
the function we needed
were not accessible for Elena,

00:32:51.718 --> 00:32:56.219
so we had to adopt to a custom solution.

00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:07.168
<v Elena> I enter in detail because this
is still a work-in-progress adventure,

00:33:08.608 --> 00:33:11.548
this multilingual site.

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:18.567
I tried many plugins,
WPTranslate, Polylang, WPML

00:33:18.568 --> 00:33:19.568
and so on,

00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:27.060
but besides accessibility

00:33:28.098 --> 00:33:32.459
needs that every need was covered.

00:33:33.748 --> 00:33:36.118
as my website

00:33:37.064 --> 00:33:39.238
mostly fiction stories have

00:33:39.862 --> 00:33:46.444
inside word games and things
that cannot be automatically

00:33:46.445 --> 00:33:48.505
rendered into English,

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:54.221
or at least the content
cannot be the same,

00:33:54.357 --> 00:33:55.408
let's say that.

00:33:59.239 --> 00:34:03.449
I had to choose to do it on my own,

00:34:04.129 --> 00:34:07.573
so we just created

00:34:07.863 --> 00:34:10.159
two headers, two footers,

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:12.689
four sidebars,

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:17.079
Italian-English for real
and Italian-English for fantasy.

00:34:18.273 --> 00:34:22.363
The patterns and the template parts
I had to practice to with

00:34:22.383 --> 00:34:33.746
these new terms and new concepts
that Gloria has accurately explained me

00:34:33.747 --> 00:34:34.747
what they were.

00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:44.593
Then every time I have to write a post,
I manually switch the template

00:34:45.063 --> 00:34:46.288
from one to another.

00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:51.867
So, search field,
WordPress search block has

00:34:51.868 --> 00:34:54.569
no customization,

00:34:54.838 --> 00:35:00.628
you cannot set the query
by slash queries you can use,

00:35:01.068 --> 00:35:05.339
you cannot address it to use queries.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.846
Well, you can edit it
in Gutenberg's code view,

00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:17.729
you can establish which category ID
or taxonomy to use,

00:35:18.018 --> 00:35:20.613
but not in the interface.

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:30.389
I just called one external dev
which helped me

00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:32.338
to create this,

00:35:34.452 --> 00:35:36.868
the intervention from PHP

00:35:39.648 --> 00:35:40.648
to interface.

00:35:40.649 --> 00:35:45.988
Because if Gutenberg helped me to create

00:35:47.038 --> 00:35:52.828
the basic query,
and by JSON code I added manually

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:54.099
the taxonomy,

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:57.958
then the result was not coherent.

00:35:58.806 --> 00:36:04.978
There was no coherence within the result,
and it's a header or footer.

00:36:04.979 --> 00:36:10.828
You got the result with text in English,
but header or footer in Italian,

00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:12.449
that's not good.

00:36:13.709 --> 00:36:18.959
The developer has helped me to make
the search check for templates.

00:36:21.798 --> 00:36:24.118
Then another trouble happened,

00:36:25.078 --> 00:36:31.847
it was lock screen reader language,
because when you set

00:36:31.848 --> 00:36:34.462
the language of WordPress,

00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:39.002
HTML language
attribute changes accordingly.

00:36:39.212 --> 00:36:42.988
It is a good behavior,
it is a correct behavior,

00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:47.038
but if the WordPress language

00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:52.739
is set in Italian by default
and you are reading English content,

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.299
screen reader has
the wrong pronunciation and vice versa.

00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:00.759
What did I do?

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:07.258
I consulted both Google
and Artificial Intelligence

00:37:08.279 --> 00:37:11.369
and edited manually

00:37:12.389 --> 00:37:19.378
the developer plugin adding
if category, whatever,

00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:21.898
blog post, whatever,

00:37:23.009 --> 00:37:27.958
switch locale to Italian
or English accordingly.

00:37:28.529 --> 00:37:34.409
Then, the challenge was in common areas.

00:37:35.098 --> 00:37:38.958
Common area means archives, authors,

00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:41.383
404 error.

00:37:42.328 --> 00:37:44.648
The heading remained in Italian.

00:37:46.658 --> 00:37:52.278
Helping with the help
of the Artificial Intelligence,

00:37:52.778 --> 00:37:56.953
I created some very,
very basic,

00:37:56.984 --> 00:37:59.038
very rudimental code,

00:38:00.808 --> 00:38:07.228
because I am not a coder and I want
to remind it that I am not a developer.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:18.142
With the aid of these automated tools,
I created those basic if-else conditions.

00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:21.627
If checking the category,

00:38:21.628 --> 00:38:31.888
checking the author, the post/page author,
and to change the language accordingly.

00:38:32.038 --> 00:38:33.748
If the author is English,

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:37.109
please change English
and Italian and so on.

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:49.499
Then, inspired by another basic plugin
developed by an Egyptian developer,

00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:51.129
it's called IntelliBuilder.

00:38:53.218 --> 00:38:55.738
It deals with visibility blocks,

00:38:56.729 --> 00:39:00.509
blocks visible or invisible
according to conditions.

00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:05.309
I discovered that you can use

00:39:06.598 --> 00:39:08.069
check for browser language

00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:18.058
and finally I found the challenge
to register WordPress short code.

00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:21.808
That if the browser language

00:39:22.379 --> 00:39:23.379
is Italian,

00:39:24.198 --> 00:39:30.839
show the text enclosed
into ETA short code,

00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:38.009
or if you have the English short code,

00:39:39.028 --> 00:39:48.869
this text enclosed into English short code
is shown if browser language is different

00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:49.928
from Italian.

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:59.969
It's very basic because it does not have
a multilingual exclusive functionality,

00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:05.939
but for the moment is what I need
and what respects my needs.

00:40:07.305 --> 00:40:09.628
I just share my experience.

00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:15.665
<v Gloria> Perfect.

00:40:15.975 --> 00:40:17.626
Now--

00:40:21.882 --> 00:40:22.882
Okay.

00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:31.953
In the slide of this talk,

00:40:32.859 --> 00:40:35.259
we found our contact

00:40:35.799 --> 00:40:37.178
and thank you.

00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:39.289
We finish it.

00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:52.859
<v Elena> You can find me on LinkedIn,
on the Slack,

00:40:53.049 --> 00:40:57.817
on wordpress.org Slack, on Mastodon.

00:40:58.858 --> 00:41:03.918
There are my--
<v Gloria> Everywhere [laughs].

00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:08.248
You are everywhere, Elena.

00:41:09.168 --> 00:41:10.388
<v Elena> Yes.

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:16.838
<v Gloria> Okay, any questions?

00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:20.879
<v Elena> Any question.
<v Gloria> You are okay.

00:41:24.785 --> 00:41:27.068
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you so much, Elena

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:31.088
and Gloria for that lovely,
lovely session,

00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:33.878
and thank you everyone for listening.

00:41:33.878 --> 00:41:38.258
Just remember that you can ask
your questions in the Q&amp;A section

00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:43.229
and they will be available
to answer all of them.

00:41:46.725 --> 00:41:47.725
Okay.

00:41:50.155 --> 00:41:57.747
We have a question from David DeNedo.

00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:02.561
He says, in your opinion,

00:42:02.671 --> 00:42:05.611
is the editor backend of full site

00:42:05.641 --> 00:42:09.690
editing more accessible
for visually impaired developers

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.543
than classic teams like GeneratePress?

00:42:13.578 --> 00:42:15.928
I don't know
if you would like to take that,

00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:17.078
Elena or Gloria?

00:42:17.948 --> 00:42:19.088
<v Gloria> Elena.

00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:25.392
<v Elena> I think it depends
on the point of view,

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.238
because as I said, I am not a coder.

00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:41.193
I find the user interface
more easier to handle than the coder.

00:42:42.338 --> 00:42:47.469
Because you have not to worry
about many things,

00:42:47.528 --> 00:42:49.158
many errors.

00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:53.379
Something can go wrong
and block everything.

00:42:54.804 --> 00:42:58.839
It's quite accurate.

00:42:58.899 --> 00:43:02.708
The accessibility of interface
is quite accurate.

00:43:04.058 --> 00:43:10.239
I think it can be improved
because you should personalize more.

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:13.957
For example, the search block,
it could be integrated

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:16.959
and much more personalization
should be made

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:20.686
and should be possible
using the search block.

00:43:23.486 --> 00:43:25.285
If you are a coder,

00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:29.730
if you can deal with code and so on,

00:43:30.648 --> 00:43:35.028
you could find the classic editor easier.

00:43:36.518 --> 00:43:38.317
From my point of view,

00:43:38.348 --> 00:43:42.891
I was very, very upset to hear
that many blind people still use

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.176
classic editors.

00:43:45.513 --> 00:43:48.150
Gutenberg is not a nuclear weapon.

00:43:49.688 --> 00:43:51.669
I think give it a try,

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:55.568
because if no one gives

00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:57.366
a try to it,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:05.511
you never become aware of bugs,
of what to improve.

00:44:06.638 --> 00:44:08.528
If people are unhappy,

00:44:08.649 --> 00:44:16.160
please use it and share the experience
to proper GitHub and so on.

00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:18.059
Thank you.

00:44:21.567 --> 00:44:24.488
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you so much.

00:44:25.034 --> 00:44:30.060
We have another question.

00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:34.956
It says, have you found
that any other plugins

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:38.487
hinder the accessibility
of the full site editor?

00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:42.209
<v Elena> No, I didn't understand.

00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:43.908
Have you found--

00:44:45.277 --> 00:44:50.017
<v Yigakpoa> Okay, so the person is asking
if there are any other plugins that hinder

00:44:50.018 --> 00:44:53.199
the accessibility of the full site editor.

00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:01.749
<v Elena> Other plugins?

00:45:01.797 --> 00:45:08.892
There are many Gutenberg-based
block plugins,

00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:18.401
but I don't know if they take care
of accessibility so much.

00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:26.679
It depends on the developer,
how aware they are,

00:45:27.039 --> 00:45:30.069
if they use native core functionalities,

00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:34.694
or they customize
the interface.

00:45:35.144 --> 00:45:37.149
I found, for example,

00:45:37.209 --> 00:45:38.209
a plugin

00:45:38.649 --> 00:45:47.229
called Ultimate Block that Gloria
and I were using for table of contents,

00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:50.948
to add the table of contents to stories.

00:45:51.959 --> 00:45:55.696
They were not accessible
because screen reader

00:45:55.697 --> 00:46:01.921
did not detect which element
was turned on or off, checkboxes,

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.820
radio buttons, and so on.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:10.778
It's always a challenge when dealing
with third-party plugins.

00:46:12.749 --> 00:46:17.405
My invitation for developers is,
please, do it accessible

00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:27.234
because it gives more chances to creators.

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.707
<v Yigakpoa> Thank you so much.

00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:37.419
Thank you so much,
Elena, for this insightful session.

00:46:37.959 --> 00:46:39.098
Thank you everyone,

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:42.796
for attending the session
with Gloria Liuni

00:46:42.855 --> 00:46:44.705
and Elena Brescacin.
