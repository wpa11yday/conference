>> JEREMY RIVERA: Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:42.024
My name is Jeremy Rivera
and I'm a developer advocate

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:43.760
from Deque Systems.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.262
Thank you for joining us
for a game-changing approach

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:50.913
to accessibility education
with Olivia Richter.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.068
Olivia is a web designer,
passionate about

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.005
creating accessible
digital solutions.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.774
Since founding her own
company in 2023,

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:00.876
she has been creating
user-friendly websites

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:05.161
with WordPress that prioritize
accessibility standards.

00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:09.084
For Olivia, creative projects
are more than just work.

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.686
They are heartfelt endeavors

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.099
that combine functionality
with inclusivity,

00:02:14.257 --> 00:02:18.224
ensuring the web
is a welcoming place for everyone.

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.761
She believes accessibility

00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:22.764
should be as engaging
as it is essential.

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:27.169
This philosophy led her to develop
a unique digital escape game

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.772
that flips the rules of access,
challenging players

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:34.026
to rethink how they interact
with the web.

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.402
Please feel free
to add your questions

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:38.180
in the Zoom Q&A section,

00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:41.049
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.541
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:47.789
>> OLIVIA RICHTER: Hello.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.760
Today, I'm going to talk about
a game-changing approach

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.097
to accessibility education.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.064
I'm Olivia Richter.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:03:01.136
I have a brown pixie cut,
I wear glasses, and a black shirt.

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:03.605
I'm a WordPress web designer by day,

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.575
and an accessibility
advocate by passion.

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:08.744
My job is building
inclusive websites,

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:11.213
but my superpower
is learning new things,

00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:13.749
and getting lost in side quests.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.985
The last part is probably
how I ended up here.

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:18.687
Not necessarily to teach you,

00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:22.124
but to take you through my journey
of getting people on board

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.356
with digital accessibility.

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.596
See, here's the thing I've learned.

00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:30.132
We all say we care about inclusion,

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.135
but getting people to act on it,

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:36.138
that's where
the real adventure begins.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.701
Let's start from the beginning.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.545
People create digital experiences.

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:48.216
I know, incredibly insightful,
but if you really think about it,

00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:49.706
that is where the issue

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:53.321
of inaccessible
experiences has its root.

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:57.526
Most of those people never
face the barriers they create.

00:03:57.527 --> 00:04:01.229
They are like chefs
who don't taste their own food,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.599
serving up dishes
that poison some of the diners,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.302
and they don't even realize it.

00:04:07.303 --> 00:04:08.336
Why?

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:11.606
Because when you can glide
through a website with a mouse,

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:14.876
why would you question
a broken tab border?

00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:19.637
When you can see colors perfectly,
why stress about contrast?

00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:22.450
Exclusion isn't malice, mostly.

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.765
It's ignorance on autopilot.

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:30.992
We call this issue the empathy gap,

00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:33.461
an inability for people to empathize

00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:35.463
with others, in this case people

00:04:35.464 --> 00:04:38.066
with disabilities,
leading them to ignore

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:41.875
the barriers that disabled
people face every day,

00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:44.739
but let's call it what it is.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.178
Most people don't give
a damn until it happens to them.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:53.014
Disability is the thought of,
"It won't be me."

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.318
Until, of course, it is.

00:04:55.618 --> 00:04:59.855
Broken arms, aging eyes,
situational limits,

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:02.425
or getting into a car accident.

00:05:02.558 --> 00:05:06.128
Disability is the world's
most inclusive club.

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:12.300
How do we close the empathy gap?

00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:15.470
How do we get every developer,
every designer,

00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:18.240
every editor to create
while having people

00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:20.342
with disabilities in mind?

00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:22.612
Well, it's complicated.

00:05:24.447 --> 00:05:27.949
A common way we try to get
people to empathize with people

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.472
with disabilities, is to simulate
the disability for them.

00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:36.992
This can look something
like using a wheelchair for an hour,

00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:40.881
or you blindfold yourself
to simulate being blind.

00:05:40.963 --> 00:05:44.216
Think about these
blindfolded trust walks,

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:47.469
or using earplugs
where you simulate being hard

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.472
of hearing or deaf.

00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:53.299
Let me give you a personal example.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.379
I visited this museum
in the Netherlands,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.579
the Muzieum in Nijmegen,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.686
where they take you on a tour
in complete darkness.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.787
Unlike in this picture here,

00:06:05.788 --> 00:06:08.690
where you can rarely
see a chair and the floor,

00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.927
it was completely dark.

00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:12.661
You're led by a guide you meet

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:16.197
in the darkness, so,
you can't see them.

00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:17.632
They don't see you either.

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.601
Not just because of the darkness,

00:06:19.602 --> 00:06:22.404
but because they're visually
impaired.

00:06:22.405 --> 00:06:25.407
In the dark,
you're navigating everyday spaces.

00:06:25.408 --> 00:06:29.644
Like a home, you cross a street,
and you end up in a bar.

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:32.415
All without relying on sight.

00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:34.410
While enjoying your drink,

00:06:34.411 --> 00:06:38.788
your guide asks
you what you think they look like.

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:42.546
I have to say,
it was incredibly eye-opening.

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:45.360
While it was just a brief experience

00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:48.063
for me, the real purpose hits home.

00:06:48.064 --> 00:06:50.532
The simulation
of blindness can help people

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:55.037
with degenerative vision
prepare for the future.

00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:59.914
Imagine training your other senses
to handle daily tasks.

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:05.023
Here's a simulation of dyslexia.

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:10.041
The letters in the text change
places, and it's hard to read.

00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:13.154
It's a great reminder
that what seems simple to you,

00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:14.622
can be a real challenge

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:18.511
when your brain processes
information differently.

00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:23.099
With all that said, does it work?

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:25.467
Does simulating
the experience of people

00:07:25.468 --> 00:07:29.371
with disabilities work to get
non-disabled people to create

00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:31.686
more accessible experiences?

00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:33.809
It depends.

00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:37.812
Targeted simulations
can be surprisingly effective

00:07:37.813 --> 00:07:41.304
when used like a spotlight,
not a floodlight.

00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:45.153
You need to show
why color contrast matters.

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.255
A quick color blindness
simulation slaps

00:07:47.256 --> 00:07:49.391
the designer with an, "Oh wow,

00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:52.527
I literally can't read that moment."

00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:54.759
No guideline can replicate.

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:58.099
Here, we have such
a simulation of green

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.935
blindness with a yellow
forest in the background,

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:05.975
and text in the foreground that,
well, I can't read.

00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.981
Also, the same simulation

00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:11.790
with complete color
blindness in black and white,

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:16.365
and this is the picture
without the simulation.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:18.720
The forest stays yellow,

00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:22.257
but you have red text
on top of it that reads,

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:24.060
"Can you read that?"

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.597
It's not a great contrast,
but that's the whole point.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:32.944
While simulations
like blindfolding sometimes stick

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:36.538
where theory fails,
there are a few reasons.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.874
First, they're visceral.

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:41.509
They expose hidden design flaws,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.237
and they make barriers feel real.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.748
Nothing makes a manager prioritize

00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:51.033
accessibility like struggling
to use their own product,

00:08:51.187 --> 00:08:53.988
but there are a lot of limitations.

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:56.303
Let's get into some of them.

00:08:57.293 --> 00:09:00.229
Disabilities aren't
one-size-fits-all.

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:03.331
We need to acknowledge
that disabilities,

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:06.801
even specific diagnosis,
do not always cause

00:09:06.802 --> 00:09:10.372
the same experience
for every affected person.

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:12.941
You can see two different simulations

00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:15.810
of diabetic retinopathy here.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.947
There are different dark spots
in the field of view.

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:21.797
On one, there are
smaller and more dots,

00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:25.353
and on the other one,
on the other simulation,

00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:29.825
there are a few bigger,
more irregular spots.

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:32.760
This means that
the simulation can, at best,

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:37.165
only simulate the temporary
experience of a specific person.

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:41.450
More likely, it will simulate
the experience of no one.

00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:46.873
A temporary simulation
is not the same as lived experience.

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:50.081
Spending an hour
in a wheelchair teaches you

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:52.847
how to spend an hour in a wheelchair.

00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:56.818
What's missed is the exhaustion
of planning every route,

00:09:56.819 --> 00:09:59.654
the stairs, the broken elevator,

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:03.054
the train and bus that can't
accommodate you at the moment,

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:05.727
the plane crew
that destroys your wheelchair,

00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:08.696
the bureaucracy
with the healthcare system,

00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:12.347
and to tie it all together,
the discrimination.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:16.066
Even more,
if a disability is combined

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:18.973
with factors such as race or class,

00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:22.311
intersectionality
plays additionally to it.

00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:25.130
Intersectionality is the intersection

00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:28.031
of multiple forms of discrimination.

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:33.389
Simulations can distort reality.

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:35.690
They can be misleading.

00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:37.225
You might think you know about

00:10:37.226 --> 00:10:39.661
the capabilities
of a disabled person,

00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:43.331
but you didn't train
and you don't have the context.

00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:46.100
This can lead to pity
for the disabled person,

00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:49.170
to frustration,
and the idea of incompetence,

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:54.343
which does not reflect the experience
of people with disabilities.

00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:56.862
It can be patronizing.

00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:02.717
Simulations can reduce disabilities

00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:06.821
to stereotypes like,
"All blind people use Braille,"

00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:09.357
or more relevant to this talk,

00:11:09.358 --> 00:11:12.360
"All blind people
use a Screen Reader."

00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.997
This, of course, is not true.

00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:18.132
Another issue is the simple fact

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:21.736
that some disabilities just
cannot be simulated in a way

00:11:21.737 --> 00:11:24.911
that even remotely
matches lived reality.

00:11:25.574 --> 00:11:27.809
Think about chronic pain.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.015
How do you simulate fatigue
that builds up over hours?

00:11:32.414 --> 00:11:34.148
Autistic sensory overload,

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:37.853
which isn't just loud
noises equals to bad.

00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:40.755
Another example
is the loss of mobility,

00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:44.406
which can cause issues
with some input devices.

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:48.296
Like in this picture where the person
has a prosthetic hand.

00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:51.633
People who are used to working
with a mouse can understand

00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:53.368
that some people need websites

00:11:53.369 --> 00:11:56.404
to work with a keyboard,
but too often

00:11:56.405 --> 00:11:58.740
that ends up being translated into,

00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:00.675
"Let's add a bunch of keyboard macros

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:03.770
to make our app
usable with a keyboard."

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:08.349
In reality, this approach
often causes even more issues,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.396
because the developer
didn't understand the problem.

00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:17.025
We run the risk of giving
designers ideas for fixes that do fix

00:12:17.026 --> 00:12:20.329
the barriers
for the simulated disability,

00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:22.032
but do little to improve

00:12:22.062 --> 00:12:25.360
the experience
of real disabled people.

00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:28.903
We end up training developers
and designers to design

00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:34.008
for simulations, not people,
and we waste time on fixes

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:36.819
that can create even new barriers.

00:12:38.814 --> 00:12:42.650
We also need to address
the fact that simulated disabilities

00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:45.054
are a controversial topic.

00:12:45.354 --> 00:12:48.189
A simulated disability
is trying to portray

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.724
the experience of people,

00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:54.089
but only portrays a very narrow
part of this experience,

00:12:54.096 --> 00:12:58.856
and it reduces lived experience
to a temporary inconvenience.

00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:02.970
Furthermore, the simulation
of a disability creates

00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:05.606
the perception that the problem

00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:08.309
is within the person
with a disability,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.447
and that we as creators
of digital spaces have to adapt

00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:15.017
our products to their needs.

00:13:15.984 --> 00:13:19.554
I would see parallels
to the medical model of disability,

00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:24.759
where disability is seen as something
that has to be cured, or corrected.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.595
The focus is on
the individual's impairment,

00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:30.323
rather than the system's failure.

00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:35.677
This model faces a lot of criticism
because of its ableist views,

00:13:35.804 --> 00:13:38.606
so we always need to contextualize

00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:40.616
these simulations with the knowledge

00:13:40.617 --> 00:13:42.410
that the barriers are the problem,

00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:44.812
not the disabilities, and especially,

00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:47.749
not the people with the disabilities.

00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.619
Then, there's the ethical question.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.654
Is it appropriate for someone

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:57.725
without a disability
to pretend to have one,

00:13:57.726 --> 00:14:00.596
even for educational purposes?

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.398
Some argue
that it can feel dismissive,

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:06.567
or even exploitative,
especially when it's done

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:10.297
without the input
from the disability community.

00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:12.507
The uncomfortable truth is,

00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:16.078
simulations can feel
like disability cosplay.

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:22.583
People may gain some empathy
through a simulation,

00:14:22.584 --> 00:14:25.820
but is this empathy
really directed towards

00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:28.383
the person with the disability?

00:14:28.557 --> 00:14:33.061
Maybe, but often in a pitiful way,
and not empowering.

00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:35.129
In most cases,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.367
this empathy is more likely
directed at the perceived reality

00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:44.038
of the simulation, and often
ends up solving the wrong problem.

00:14:44.039 --> 00:14:48.509
To summarize, critics argue
this empathy is short-lived,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.345
and doesn't equate
to lived experience.

00:14:51.346 --> 00:14:56.106
You might prioritize temporary
fixes over systemic inclusion.

00:14:56.452 --> 00:15:00.154
These simulations can reinforce
the medical model thinking,

00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:03.646
where disability is seen
as a problem to fix.

00:15:04.793 --> 00:15:06.994
I want to empathize that I do think

00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.963
that simulations can have merits,

00:15:08.964 --> 00:15:12.455
and can be very useful
in some circumstances,

00:15:13.135 --> 00:15:17.772
but clearly, simulating
a disability to encourage empathy

00:15:17.773 --> 00:15:21.309
is not a catch-all solution
to the complex topic

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:26.648
of accessibility advocacy,
so, what is?

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:32.620
The real answer to the empathy gap

00:15:32.621 --> 00:15:35.795
is listening to people
with disabilities.

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.993
Plain and simple.

00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:39.994
It's about listening, learning,

00:15:39.995 --> 00:15:45.267
and committing to creating
experiences that work for everyone.

00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:47.935
The empathy gap doesn't close

00:15:47.936 --> 00:15:51.073
through simulations,
pity, or guesswork.

00:15:51.206 --> 00:15:54.309
It closes when we shut up and listen.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.310
At the end of the day,

00:15:56.311 --> 00:15:59.981
accessibility isn't about
assuming what works.

00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:02.083
It's about centering disabled voices

00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:05.496
in design, development,
and decision-making.

00:16:06.221 --> 00:16:07.955
This is shown and shown again.

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:10.435
Accessibility improves
when designers,

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:14.362
developers, creators,
managers, and everyone else

00:16:14.363 --> 00:16:17.765
involved in the process
of creating digital experiences,

00:16:17.766 --> 00:16:20.635
has direct conversations
with disabled people,

00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:23.639
and actually listens to them.

00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:29.310
This works so well, because,
as people, we can empathize

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:32.813
really well with the people
we meet in our real lives.

00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:34.582
We understand their experience much

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:38.452
better if we see how they interact
with our products.

00:16:38.453 --> 00:16:42.023
There is no real replacement
for this process.

00:16:42.658 --> 00:16:44.659
Watching a screen
reader user struggle

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.495
with your intuitive UI is much

00:16:47.496 --> 00:16:50.987
more eye-opening than
any blindfold exercise.

00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:57.071
This approach also comes
with plenty of other benefits,

00:16:57.072 --> 00:17:01.342
including but not limited
to more diverse viewpoints,

00:17:01.343 --> 00:17:05.213
and product teams,
increased adaptability,

00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:08.849
higher employee
retention and satisfaction,

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:11.786
better company culture,
and many more.

00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:16.045
When disabled people
are part of the process,

00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:18.993
designs are stress-tested early,
you don't get

00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:22.029
these last-minute
accessibility patches,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.766
innovation thrives,
and everyone wins.

00:17:25.767 --> 00:17:27.468
Think about the curb cut effect,

00:17:27.469 --> 00:17:29.770
where curb cuts
were invented for wheelchairs,

00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:32.473
but now everyone uses them.

00:17:32.474 --> 00:17:36.110
For example, if you use a stroller,
a bike, a trolley,

00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.714
or your transport-heavy stuff.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:46.021
Our goal is to normalize
accessibility as a core skill,

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:50.458
not a niche checklist,
and never ever assume you know

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:53.871
better than the people
you're designing for.

00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:57.431
A lot of people hear this, and think

00:17:57.432 --> 00:18:00.968
that I am suggesting
that they should need to add people

00:18:00.969 --> 00:18:04.305
with disabilities to their quality
assurance pipeline,

00:18:04.306 --> 00:18:06.407
and they absolutely should,

00:18:06.408 --> 00:18:09.577
but this is not just
what I am saying.

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:14.100
People with disabilities
should be involved in every step.

00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:16.317
They should be involved in every step

00:18:16.318 --> 00:18:19.421
of the way towards the final product.

00:18:20.989 --> 00:18:25.092
This solution is not as easy
to implement as it sounds.

00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:28.896
Hiring disabled talent
isn't as simple as posting a job ad,

00:18:28.897 --> 00:18:31.542
and waiting for magic to happen.

00:18:31.633 --> 00:18:34.268
We have the perfect candidate trap.

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:38.472
The problem is,
companies want unicorns, for example,

00:18:38.473 --> 00:18:43.077
a senior React developer
who is also an accessibility expert,

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.247
and has lived experience.

00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:49.250
The reality is,
you don't need a disability hire.

00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:53.059
You need great talent
who happens to be disabled.

00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:55.723
The awareness gap.

00:18:55.724 --> 00:18:57.958
Many companies don't even realize

00:18:57.959 --> 00:19:00.594
that their product,
or website is inaccessible,

00:19:00.595 --> 00:19:04.562
and that they should hire
people with disabilities.

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:07.735
The accessibility paradox.

00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:10.706
Career pages are often inaccessible.

00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:14.241
The irony is,
that companies often say,

00:19:14.242 --> 00:19:16.677
"We can't hire
people with disabilities

00:19:16.678 --> 00:19:19.647
until we fix our site,
which we need people

00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:22.127
with disabilities to help fix.

00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:27.254
Yes, this takes time and work,
but guess what?

00:19:27.255 --> 00:19:29.604
So does retrofitting accessibility

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:32.937
after you've built
an exclusionary product.

00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:37.846
You can't build products
for people you refuse to hire.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.234
This isn't about charity hiring.

00:19:40.235 --> 00:19:43.804
It's about closing the empathy
gap where it matters most.

00:19:43.805 --> 00:19:45.507
Your payroll.

00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:50.377
With all these problems in mind,
I would argue

00:19:50.378 --> 00:19:53.481
that there is some space
for another approach.

00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:55.916
This approach, of course,
still can't replace

00:19:55.917 --> 00:19:59.987
the input from the people
with disabilities, but it can address

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:03.357
some of the issues
with simulating disabilities,

00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:08.997
and that is simulating barriers,

00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:13.467
but wait, didn't
I just say five minutes ago

00:20:13.468 --> 00:20:16.483
that simulations
are not the way to go?

00:20:17.072 --> 00:20:20.007
I did, but there's a seemingly
subtle difference

00:20:20.008 --> 00:20:24.211
between simulating disabilities
and simulating barriers,

00:20:24.212 --> 00:20:26.857
so what am I even talking about?

00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:30.985
Let me give you an example,
which we will use to explain

00:20:30.986 --> 00:20:35.984
the difference, and why I think
this might be a better approach.

00:20:36.124 --> 00:20:38.159
A simple and crude way to simulate

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.095
visual impairment
might involve using glasses

00:20:41.096 --> 00:20:43.597
that restrict peripheral vision,

00:20:43.598 --> 00:20:46.867
forcing a developer
to resize their browser window

00:20:46.868 --> 00:20:49.437
to fit a narrow field of view.

00:20:49.504 --> 00:20:51.672
In doing so, they might realize

00:20:51.673 --> 00:20:55.376
their app doesn't handle
different viewport sizes,

00:20:55.377 --> 00:20:59.013
but that comes with all the problems
we talked about before,

00:20:59.014 --> 00:21:03.284
like shifting the focus
to adapting to the disability,

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:06.935
instead of the barriers
within the application.

00:21:07.422 --> 00:21:10.991
Let's try to simulate a barrier
which does not require

00:21:10.992 --> 00:21:14.721
the user to take
on a different kind of persona.

00:21:15.096 --> 00:21:17.131
What if we designed an application

00:21:17.132 --> 00:21:20.034
that worked perfectly
for narrow viewports,

00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:21.602
but is completely broken

00:21:21.603 --> 00:21:25.094
when viewed on a standard
widescreen display?

00:21:26.174 --> 00:21:28.276
Something like this.

00:21:29.644 --> 00:21:32.580
I am showing a video,
where the content shifts

00:21:32.581 --> 00:21:37.017
or disappears unpredictably
in a widescreen format,

00:21:37.018 --> 00:21:40.826
but it is completely
fine in the narrow viewport.

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:51.565
Why do I think
this approach is better?

00:21:51.566 --> 00:21:55.069
Well, for a start,
it hits people without forcing them

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.137
to change their perspective.

00:21:57.138 --> 00:22:00.342
It hits them at home, so to speak.

00:22:00.642 --> 00:22:04.178
Users don't have to pretend
to be someone else.

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:09.016
They just experience frustration
the way they naturally browse.

00:22:09.017 --> 00:22:12.920
They get to experience the feeling
of getting into a digital experience

00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:16.557
which works as it should,
and does what it says, yet,

00:22:16.558 --> 00:22:18.259
it is not designed for them,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.496
and therefore,
does not work for them.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.998
The problem isn't them.

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:26.067
It's the broken design.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.374
Instead of thinking, "Wow, being
visually impaired must be hard,"

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:35.654
and pitying disabled people,

00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:39.380
they think, "Wow,
this layout is terrible.

00:22:39.381 --> 00:22:42.108
Now, I am furious at bad design."

00:22:43.652 --> 00:22:48.730
The focus stays on fixing the system,
not adapting to disability.

00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:53.420
One leads to charity,
the other leads to change.

00:22:55.997 --> 00:22:57.431
You shouldn't need to pretend

00:22:57.432 --> 00:23:00.764
to be disabled to care
about accessibility.

00:23:00.835 --> 00:23:05.607
You just need to experience
bad design, and get mad about it.

00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:09.877
Let's talk about
some of the limitations,

00:23:09.878 --> 00:23:14.083
and potential new issues
that come with this approach.

00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:21.989
While simulating barriers
is a step forward, it is not magic.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.524
The obvious first step first issue

00:23:23.525 --> 00:23:27.027
is that it can't be seen
as a plug and play

00:23:27.028 --> 00:23:30.678
replacement for
the simulation of disabilities.

00:23:30.932 --> 00:23:33.041
To explain what I mean by this,

00:23:33.042 --> 00:23:36.236
let's take the simulation
of colorblindness.

00:23:36.237 --> 00:23:39.440
We could apply a filter
to a website to simulate

00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:41.838
the loss of color perception.

00:23:41.943 --> 00:23:45.879
If we try to apply our technique
of simulating a barrier instead

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.116
of a disability,
we very quickly realize

00:23:49.117 --> 00:23:52.608
that it just doesn't work
for this situation.

00:23:52.954 --> 00:23:54.288
We can't take the website,

00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:58.225
and change it in a way to add
barriers, or to make it seem

00:23:58.226 --> 00:24:01.955
like it wasn't designed
for non-disabled people.

00:24:02.597 --> 00:24:05.106
Simulating barriers
isn't a replacement

00:24:05.107 --> 00:24:07.256
for disabled perspectives.

00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:09.737
It's a bridge to get
teams to care enough

00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:11.969
to seek those perspectives.

00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:15.042
We are not here to mimic struggle.

00:24:15.043 --> 00:24:20.849
We are here to destroy unnecessary
struggle at its source, bad design.

00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:25.986
Earlier, we identified key problems

00:24:25.987 --> 00:24:28.856
with traditional disability
simulations.

00:24:28.857 --> 00:24:31.526
Now, let's compare the two.

00:24:32.093 --> 00:24:34.294
Simulating a disability often leads

00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:38.799
to fixes that don't actually
help real disabled users,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.568
because the simulation
is based on assumptions,

00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:43.438
not lived experience.

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:45.939
Barrier simulations avoid this,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.244
because the problem
isn't tied to a specific disability.

00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:52.346
Instead of prompting a solution,

00:24:52.347 --> 00:24:54.882
it simply prompts us
to think about barriers

00:24:54.883 --> 00:24:57.819
and accessibility in a different way.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.390
The next big topic is,
of course, controversy.

00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:04.558
To be honest, I can't know for sure

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:08.362
that this different approach
is free from controversy.

00:25:08.363 --> 00:25:11.732
There's a good argument
that we are still trying to simulate

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:15.669
a part of lived experience
of people with disabilities

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:20.034
in a way that simply does
not reflect the whole picture.

00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.676
I actually agree with this argument,

00:25:22.677 --> 00:25:24.545
which is why I will always insist

00:25:24.546 --> 00:25:27.581
that the only real solution
to the empathy gap

00:25:27.582 --> 00:25:29.883
is working with people
with disabilities,

00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:33.354
and actually listening to them.

00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:37.124
My reply is, therefore,
focused on why I think

00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:39.893
that simulating barriers
at least does not shift

00:25:39.894 --> 00:25:42.096
the focus to the disability.

00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:46.266
It does not center the person
with the disability as the problem.

00:25:46.267 --> 00:25:48.836
Instead, the attention
is directed towards

00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:52.906
the products we create,
and the barriers they contain.

00:25:52.907 --> 00:25:57.747
The focus stays on broken systems,
not individual impairments.

00:25:58.413 --> 00:26:01.982
This is why I think this approach
might be more useful to trigger

00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:04.952
the kind of thinking,
and consideration that we want

00:26:04.953 --> 00:26:07.889
to see from designers and developers.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.959
This isn't about walking
in someone else's shoes.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.362
It's about realizing the shoes
we've designed are terrible,

00:26:15.363 --> 00:26:18.466
and demanding
better ones for everyone.

00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:23.036
With that said,
my personal conclusion

00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:24.638
is that these two concepts

00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:28.923
can be very useful if applied
to the correct situation.

00:26:29.177 --> 00:26:32.070
They serve very different purposes.

00:26:32.113 --> 00:26:35.482
If you want to highlight
a specific accessibility issue,

00:26:35.483 --> 00:26:38.952
a simulated disability
might be very helpful to improve

00:26:38.953 --> 00:26:43.257
the understanding for both technical,
and non-technical people.

00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:45.826
If you want to achieve
a more general mindset

00:26:45.827 --> 00:26:49.062
shift towards thinking
about the barriers we create,

00:26:49.063 --> 00:26:51.064
and provoke conversations and further

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:53.667
interest in the topic
of accessibility,

00:26:53.668 --> 00:26:56.036
an experience with simulated barriers

00:26:56.037 --> 00:26:58.351
could be much more powerful.

00:27:00.475 --> 00:27:04.521
This realization left me
with a practical challenge.

00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:08.749
How do we turn this concept
into an actual experience

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.852
that serves its purpose,

00:27:11.352 --> 00:27:14.446
and where can I find
simulated barriers?

00:27:14.589 --> 00:27:17.725
At first,
I didn't have a clear answer.

00:27:18.126 --> 00:27:19.893
Which is why I decided to start

00:27:19.894 --> 00:27:23.998
building some simulated barriers,
and go from there.

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:26.401
Here was the problem.

00:27:26.801 --> 00:27:29.770
It's surprisingly hard
to create meaningful barriers

00:27:29.771 --> 00:27:33.074
for non-disabled users
in digital spaces.

00:27:33.408 --> 00:27:36.076
I can't change
their physical capabilities,

00:27:36.077 --> 00:27:39.780
but I can change
how they interact with my designs.

00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:42.115
The solution became clear.

00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:45.065
I needed to use assistive
technologies themselves

00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:46.688
as the barriers.

00:27:46.988 --> 00:27:49.056
My approach focused on web design,

00:27:49.057 --> 00:27:52.227
where many accessibility
failures occur.

00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:54.895
Most non-disabled people navigate

00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:57.898
effortlessly with a mouse
and clear visuals,

00:27:57.899 --> 00:28:01.628
but what if those tools
suddenly became useless?

00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:04.271
That became my goal.

00:28:04.272 --> 00:28:07.908
To create experiences
where traditional tools fail,

00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:12.035
forcing users to confront
digital barriers firsthand.

00:28:14.916 --> 00:28:18.252
With this in mind,
I came up with a list of requirements

00:28:18.253 --> 00:28:22.537
for a proof of concept
that I can use for this purpose.

00:28:22.824 --> 00:28:25.025
It should be easy to understand,

00:28:25.026 --> 00:28:28.696
short, engaging, and lastly, fun.

00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:33.501
I quickly go through my thought
process of each of these.

00:28:33.835 --> 00:28:35.570
Easy to understand.

00:28:35.903 --> 00:28:38.639
No jargon, no technical deep dives.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.143
It should just be a simple,
relatable digital interaction.

00:28:43.144 --> 00:28:45.412
The goal is that anyone who uses

00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:48.666
the internet for their job,
should get it.

00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:51.685
Short, this is not
a full training course,

00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:55.323
not a lecture,
just a short "aha" moment.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.925
Because this is the appetizer,
not the main course.

00:28:58.926 --> 00:29:03.607
It's meant to spark curiosity,
not to place deeper learning.

00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:06.333
It serves as a baseline
for conversations

00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:08.736
and more in-depth learning.

00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:10.872
Engaging.

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.873
If you make the user do something,

00:29:12.874 --> 00:29:16.365
not just watch or read,
it is more memorable.

00:29:17.178 --> 00:29:18.379
Fun.

00:29:18.413 --> 00:29:21.411
The topic of fun
with this experience is something

00:29:21.412 --> 00:29:23.817
that I want to talk
a little bit deeper about

00:29:23.818 --> 00:29:26.187
because it is more nuanced.

00:29:29.357 --> 00:29:32.426
Fundamentally,
we are simulating an experience

00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:33.553
which is something

00:29:33.554 --> 00:29:36.229
that non-disabled people
are not used to.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.100
People with disabilities
are used to encountering barriers,

00:29:40.101 --> 00:29:45.639
and it is definitely not fun,
so it is reasonable to say

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.209
that the simulation of barriers
should not be fun either,

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.280
so why did I set this requirement?

00:29:53.448 --> 00:29:55.916
Fun is a powerful tool.

00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:57.719
It lowers defenses.

00:29:58.186 --> 00:30:01.988
People learn better when
they are not feeling attacked.

00:30:01.989 --> 00:30:04.192
It encourages exploration.

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:06.326
If it's interesting, they'll poke

00:30:06.327 --> 00:30:09.129
around and discover more barriers.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.256
Playful experiences
are more memorable than dry ones.

00:30:13.701 --> 00:30:15.837
We reach more people.

00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:18.805
If the experience
is pure frustration,

00:30:18.806 --> 00:30:21.616
it leads to venting, not learning.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.380
Of course, this is a balance act,
because if we focus too much

00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:28.281
on making it a fun experience,

00:30:28.282 --> 00:30:30.183
the result
would be that we lose sight

00:30:30.184 --> 00:30:34.287
of the seriousness of the issue
we are trying to highlight.

00:30:34.288 --> 00:30:38.859
It's a balance act, and never
let the fun overshadow the point.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.961
With these requirements laid out,

00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:44.165
let's talk about
the actual escape game.

00:30:45.099 --> 00:30:52.079
You can find the game
at game.ideenquelle-webdesign.de.

00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:55.175
The game is set up as a website,

00:30:55.176 --> 00:30:58.078
which I created using
the tools that I know,

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:00.013
and use in my work every day.

00:31:00.014 --> 00:31:03.822
WordPress in conjunction
with the Bricks builder.

00:31:05.787 --> 00:31:08.588
Here we have the technical
requirements.

00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:11.683
You need a screen
reader and a keyboard.

00:31:11.692 --> 00:31:16.029
Technically, you can also play
the game on an Android smartphone,

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.367
but I encourage you to use a desktop.

00:31:20.101 --> 00:31:23.336
You might ask yourself, "Well,

00:31:23.337 --> 00:31:26.473
if I'm disabled,
can I still play the game?"

00:31:26.474 --> 00:31:28.375
That's a good question.

00:31:28.376 --> 00:31:30.343
The gameplay is based on barriers,

00:31:30.344 --> 00:31:34.182
so technically speaking,
it is not accessible,

00:31:34.982 --> 00:31:39.186
but if you use a screen reader

00:31:39.187 --> 00:31:41.922
in your everyday life,
you can play the game,

00:31:41.923 --> 00:31:46.928
but some of the challenges
won't be any challenges for you.

00:31:48.596 --> 00:31:49.725
You might ask yourself,

00:31:49.726 --> 00:31:52.098
"What was so difficult about
that step?"

00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:54.968
On the other hand,
there are some challenges

00:31:54.969 --> 00:31:59.906
that are more difficult for you,
but are still possible to solve.

00:31:59.907 --> 00:32:02.209
Similar goes if you use a keyboard,

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.378
some challenges
are no challenges for you.

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:08.381
As I spoiled before that you need
a screen reader,

00:32:08.382 --> 00:32:10.861
what about hearing impairment?

00:32:11.152 --> 00:32:13.653
You can use the NVDA screen reader,

00:32:13.654 --> 00:32:15.655
for example, where you can display

00:32:15.656 --> 00:32:19.193
the text, and with that you can play.

00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:22.697
Finally, let's play.

00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:25.932
Welcome to Barrieria,

00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:29.583
a world designed
to frustrate the non-disabled.

00:32:30.638 --> 00:32:32.139
Meet Freddy.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.242
The story is centered
on a character called Freddy.

00:32:35.243 --> 00:32:39.012
Freddy has long red hair,
wears glasses, and a dark blazer.

00:32:39.013 --> 00:32:40.280
They live in Barrieria,

00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:43.083
but have a lot of knowledge
about our world.

00:32:43.084 --> 00:32:44.873
They, therefore, give us a tour

00:32:44.874 --> 00:32:48.188
through some of the barriers
people from our world tend

00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:51.125
to encounter
on websites in Barrieria.

00:32:51.292 --> 00:32:53.481
They lead
you through digital barriers

00:32:53.482 --> 00:32:55.796
locals navigate easily.

00:32:56.264 --> 00:32:59.065
Freddy is a legally
blind resident of Barrieria

00:32:59.066 --> 00:33:00.901
who knows our world well.

00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:02.202
Their role?

00:33:02.203 --> 00:33:03.537
They are your helper.

00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:05.805
They give hints when you're stuck.

00:33:05.806 --> 00:33:10.076
It was important to me
to normalize disabled expertise.

00:33:10.077 --> 00:33:11.778
We often see disabled people

00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:14.114
as the ones needing
help in the media,

00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:17.017
but rarely,
we see them as the helper.

00:33:17.018 --> 00:33:18.836
I want to change that.

00:33:19.186 --> 00:33:20.515
The second role for Freddy

00:33:20.516 --> 00:33:22.322
is to encourage us to think about

00:33:22.323 --> 00:33:24.724
the barriers in our own world.

00:33:24.725 --> 00:33:29.565
They do this by asking questions,
and providing some examples.

00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:36.579
Let me introduce
you to this world properly.

00:33:37.138 --> 00:33:39.806
Barrieria
is very similar to our world.

00:33:39.807 --> 00:33:41.775
On the surface, it may not even look

00:33:41.776 --> 00:33:45.108
that different,
until we look more closely.

00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:49.316
All public spaces have floor
markings to guide you.

00:33:49.317 --> 00:33:52.018
If you want to cross the street,
you better listen closely,

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:54.721
because the traffic
signal doesn't provide

00:33:54.722 --> 00:33:57.891
a visual indication,
just an acoustic one.

00:33:57.892 --> 00:34:01.780
Signs, books,
and menus are in Braille by default.

00:34:01.963 --> 00:34:06.327
I'm sure you can imagine
some other parts of this world.

00:34:06.734 --> 00:34:09.033
It is important to me
that we do not think

00:34:09.034 --> 00:34:12.373
of Barrieria as some kind of utopia.

00:34:12.473 --> 00:34:15.041
It isn't objectively
better than our world.

00:34:15.042 --> 00:34:16.811
It's just different.

00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:21.081
In fact, many of its features
would be inaccessible to people

00:34:21.082 --> 00:34:23.817
with certain
disabilities in our world.

00:34:23.818 --> 00:34:27.621
That's because Barrieria
wasn't designed for disabled people.

00:34:27.622 --> 00:34:30.954
It was designed
against non-disabled norms.

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:33.793
It's tempting to imagine Barrierians

00:34:33.794 --> 00:34:37.931
as some hypothetical group
with mixed assistive needs,

00:34:37.932 --> 00:34:40.081
but that misses the point.

00:34:40.201 --> 00:34:42.535
Barrieria isn't for anyone.

00:34:42.536 --> 00:34:44.471
It exists for one purpose.

00:34:44.472 --> 00:34:47.207
It's a world designed
to spite every mouse user,

00:34:47.208 --> 00:34:51.178
and annoy anyone
who relies on their vision.

00:34:52.046 --> 00:34:56.416
This might seem like overthinking,
but it's actually liberating.

00:34:56.417 --> 00:34:59.953
It frees me from worrying
whether simulations are realistic,

00:34:59.954 --> 00:35:01.755
they are not meant to be,

00:35:01.756 --> 00:35:05.802
and are not something
that would happen by accident.

00:35:05.893 --> 00:35:09.295
It centers the truth
that all design excludes someone.

00:35:09.296 --> 00:35:13.367
We just rarely notice
when we are the included ones.

00:35:14.101 --> 00:35:19.072
Now, let's go to the next page.

00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:23.110
Here's a button that says,
"To the next adventure."

00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:29.717
I am trying to click on it,
and nothing happens.

00:35:30.017 --> 00:35:31.697
What should I do?

00:35:31.886 --> 00:35:33.653
Well, it's an escape game,

00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:36.923
so we have to be a little
bit more creative,

00:35:36.924 --> 00:35:41.528
but don't worry, we just learned
that Freddy can help us.

00:35:41.529 --> 00:35:46.467
Whenever Freddy has a border
like here, we can click on them.

00:35:47.001 --> 00:35:51.772
I do that now,
and they provide us with a hint.

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:55.742
Many of you have probably
already guessed what to do.

00:35:55.743 --> 00:35:58.057
We need to use the keyboard,

00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:06.120
and yes, with the Tab key,
we can get to the button.

00:36:06.687 --> 00:36:10.124
You can see the focus indicator here.

00:36:10.458 --> 00:36:16.296
I click "Enter", and yes, we did it.

00:36:17.264 --> 00:36:20.734
We accomplished
the first of eight challenges.

00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:23.036
Freddy gives us some more explanation

00:36:23.037 --> 00:36:27.956
why it is important to have a website
usable with the keyboard.

00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:29.543
Next challenge.

00:36:31.479 --> 00:36:36.239
We have a page with a heading
that says, "Invisible message."

00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:38.852
There's a picture with black text

00:36:38.853 --> 00:36:41.922
on a dark background
that with the words,

00:36:41.923 --> 00:36:43.323
"What's the problem?"

00:36:43.324 --> 00:36:45.573
Of course,
we have Freddy with a border

00:36:45.574 --> 00:36:48.384
who could help us if we are stuck.

00:36:51.766 --> 00:36:56.336
Freddy also lets us know
why alt text is so important,

00:36:56.337 --> 00:37:01.175
and we learn about
possible barriers on websites.

00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:02.909
That's it.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.879
That's the whole page.

00:37:05.846 --> 00:37:09.115
Before we had a button
that indicated what to do.

00:37:09.116 --> 00:37:11.351
Here, we don't have
any obvious button

00:37:11.352 --> 00:37:14.655
or link, so what do we do?

00:37:14.822 --> 00:37:17.757
Freddy already gave us a little hint.

00:37:17.758 --> 00:37:19.793
They talked about the alt text.

00:37:19.794 --> 00:37:22.929
Maybe we should look into that.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.898
I'm going to start the screen reader,

00:37:24.899 --> 00:37:29.036
and let it read out
the alt text of the image.

00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:34.874
>> SCREEN READER: VoiceOver on Safari.

Heading level: Black text
on a dark blue background.

00:37:46.387 --> 00:37:47.520
What's the problem?

00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:51.124
Below in small dark blue text,
add the following part

00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:53.991
to the URL after .de/headings,

00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:56.306
then you will find your way.

00:37:56.397 --> 00:37:57.530
>> OLIVIA: Interesting.

00:37:57.531 --> 00:37:59.833
It told us that we can
there's a hidden message

00:37:59.834 --> 00:38:05.806
that we need to change the URL
to headings, so let's do that.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.182
That was correct.

00:38:15.316 --> 00:38:20.156
Alt text is very important for people
who use a screen reader.

00:38:20.688 --> 00:38:22.488
Chaotic headings.

00:38:22.489 --> 00:38:23.389
All right.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:27.227
On this page, we have multiple
headings in different sizes.

00:38:27.228 --> 00:38:29.396
That's kind of confusing.

00:38:29.496 --> 00:38:32.566
What's this page primarily about?

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.635
We could ask Freddy,
or challenge ourselves,

00:38:35.636 --> 00:38:38.572
and see if we come
up with a solution.

00:38:40.474 --> 00:38:42.041
Freddy tells us something about

00:38:42.042 --> 00:38:45.545
semantic heading structure,
and of course,

00:38:45.546 --> 00:38:47.548
some possible barriers.

00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:53.291
The focus on the page
is about heading structure.

00:38:54.321 --> 00:38:57.156
If you want to know
what this page is about,

00:38:57.157 --> 00:39:02.463
we could read the H1 heading,
but which of these is the H1?

00:39:03.264 --> 00:39:06.834
We could use a screen
reader to find that out.

00:39:09.236 --> 00:39:10.770

Chaotic headings.

Link.

00:39:20.147 --> 00:39:21.436
What is this?

00:39:21.548 --> 00:39:22.548
Heading level 1.

00:39:22.549 --> 00:39:22.982
Link.

00:39:22.983 --> 00:39:25.132
The path into the unknown.

00:39:25.686 --> 00:39:30.457
>> OLIVIA: Okay,
now we have the H1 heading level.

00:39:30.624 --> 00:39:34.193
Although it is much smaller
than the other ones, it didn't look

00:39:34.194 --> 00:39:37.230
like it was the main
heading for this page.

00:39:37.231 --> 00:39:40.967
The screen reader also told
us that the heading is clickable.

00:39:40.968 --> 00:39:42.601
Now, I'm going to click on it.

00:39:42.602 --> 00:39:45.371
>> SCREEN READER: The path

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:55.348
>> OLIVIA: Yes, we found our solution,
and solved the third puzzle.

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.167
To the next adventure.

00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:01.354
This page is very short.

00:40:01.355 --> 00:40:03.923
We have some text
in a normal font size,

00:40:03.924 --> 00:40:07.393
and in between some text
that is really small.

00:40:07.394 --> 00:40:09.862
I for sure can't read that.

00:40:09.863 --> 00:40:11.597
Again, Freddy could help us,

00:40:11.598 --> 00:40:17.104
and we have some information
about possible barriers.

00:40:18.572 --> 00:40:21.474
This one is where I let you figure
out yourself

00:40:21.475 --> 00:40:23.409
how you can solve this puzzle.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.844
A little spoiler.

00:40:24.845 --> 00:40:27.483
This time a screen
reader won't help you out,

00:40:27.484 --> 00:40:30.377
but you will see that for yourself.

00:40:30.684 --> 00:40:32.819
Also, every challenge is different,

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.470
and you have to be creative
to find a solution.

00:40:38.025 --> 00:40:40.960
Now, you got a sneak
peek into the game,

00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:44.398
but what do we actually learn
from it?

00:40:45.632 --> 00:40:48.035
Barrieria exposes the truth.

00:40:48.068 --> 00:40:49.769
Barriers aren't natural.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.450
They are designed.

00:40:51.905 --> 00:40:53.406
I want to use Barrieria

00:40:53.407 --> 00:40:55.908
and the simulation
of barriers, in general,

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:58.511
to frame the issue
of inaccessible spaces

00:40:58.512 --> 00:41:02.949
as an artificial problem created
by the designers of the space,

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:07.787
instead of a natural problem
that the designer needs to solve.

00:41:07.788 --> 00:41:10.556
Since a screen reader
and keyboard are a core mechanic

00:41:10.557 --> 00:41:14.327
of this game, users end up
learning at least the very basics

00:41:14.328 --> 00:41:17.819
of these technologies
without feeling taught.

00:41:18.098 --> 00:41:20.967
Of course, this doesn't
provide a full picture,

00:41:20.968 --> 00:41:22.477
and the usage in the game

00:41:22.478 --> 00:41:25.271
doesn't really provide
a realistic use,

00:41:25.272 --> 00:41:30.191
but it could be a jumping off
point for a more in-depth lesson.

00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:32.845
It can help accessibility newbies

00:41:32.846 --> 00:41:35.648
overcome screen reader intimidation.

00:41:35.649 --> 00:41:37.717
I noticed that some web designers

00:41:37.718 --> 00:41:40.486
who are starting
with the topic of accessibility,

00:41:40.487 --> 00:41:42.255
sometimes have reservations

00:41:42.256 --> 00:41:45.258
using a screen reader
for the first time.

00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:48.295
For them,
this could be an easy way in.

00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:53.499
Even if you had no idea
about accessibility before,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.602
you learn the basics
of digital accessibility

00:41:56.603 --> 00:41:58.738
by reading the information provided,

00:41:58.739 --> 00:42:02.151
and experiencing
digital barriers firsthand.

00:42:02.876 --> 00:42:06.780
To close,
let's revisit the core truth.

00:42:06.847 --> 00:42:09.248
At the end of this talk,
I want to reiterate

00:42:09.249 --> 00:42:11.551
this point one more time.

00:42:11.552 --> 00:42:13.886
The real solution
to get people to engage

00:42:13.887 --> 00:42:15.755
with the topic of accessibility,

00:42:15.756 --> 00:42:20.594
is and will always be listening
to people with disabilities.

00:42:21.328 --> 00:42:23.996
No simulation, no matter how clever,

00:42:23.997 --> 00:42:27.334
can replace listening
to disabled people.

00:42:29.336 --> 00:42:31.170
What the game Barrieria offers,

00:42:31.171 --> 00:42:36.249
is it's a bridge for those who've
never considered accessibility.

00:42:36.944 --> 00:42:40.276
It's a spark to turn
awareness into action.

00:42:40.347 --> 00:42:44.150
A tool to make learning stick,
so when disabled colleagues speak,

00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:48.387
their expertise lands
on fertile ground, and of course,

00:42:48.388 --> 00:42:52.434
the understanding
that the barriers are the problem,

00:42:54.361 --> 00:42:59.181
so, while you're creating
those job postings,

00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:06.140
feel free to try out the game
at game.ideenquelle-webdesign.de,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.175
or create
similar experiences to change

00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:13.880
the way your colleagues and friends
think about accessibility.

00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:17.216
Let me know what ideas
you come up with, and together,

00:43:17.217 --> 00:43:21.105
let's make the world
a little bit more accessible.

00:43:21.188 --> 00:43:24.203
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:30.326
Jeremy Rivera: Thank you, Olivia,
for that wonderful talk.

00:43:30.454 --> 00:43:32.118
Thank you for elucidating

00:43:32.196 --> 00:43:35.196
some of the common problems
we're seeing in the hiring space,

00:43:35.591 --> 00:43:39.075
and also thank you for giving us
a tour of Barrier Area.

00:43:40.525 --> 00:43:44.522
We have a couple questions,
and I have some more personally too.

00:43:44.602 --> 00:43:46.251
The first one is

00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:50.910
simulation can feel like
disability cosplay, as you said,

00:43:51.284 --> 00:43:55.561
and you suggest that we should listen to
and learn from people with disabilities.

00:43:56.174 --> 00:43:57.827
I understand what you're saying,

00:43:57.983 --> 00:43:59.323
yet I'm also worried

00:43:59.378 --> 00:44:02.556
that this puts burden
on education on them.

00:44:02.859 --> 00:44:04.419
How could we balance that?

00:44:05.596 --> 00:44:09.512
Olivia Richter: At first, I want to say
thank you so much for the question.

00:44:09.825 --> 00:44:11.699
That's a really, really good point.

00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:15.537
I would say the important thing

00:44:15.616 --> 00:44:20.641
that listening does not mean
bombarding people with questions.

00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:23.298
Also the main point is

00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:29.608
that the thing I've talked before is
you should hire the people

00:44:29.804 --> 00:44:32.939
because I'm sure
there are many people with disabilities

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:36.852
who would love
to tell you about everything

00:44:37.704 --> 00:44:40.467
and just pay them for their service.

00:44:41.352 --> 00:44:43.088
It's a really simple solution,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:49.933
but I think this is an easy way

00:44:50.027 --> 00:44:53.848
to balance those two things.

00:44:55.033 --> 00:44:56.113
Jeremy: Thank you.

00:44:56.216 --> 00:44:57.921
Then how do you think

00:44:57.967 --> 00:45:02.431
that companies could do more
or be more aware and open

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.600
about hiring
people with disabilities?

00:45:10.316 --> 00:45:16.285
Olivia: I would say that they just realize
that it is really important

00:45:16.356 --> 00:45:19.007
that they should hire
people with disabilities.

00:45:24.757 --> 00:45:27.950
All the things
I talked about before that,

00:45:28.185 --> 00:45:29.185
first of all,

00:45:29.272 --> 00:45:32.630
they also have
customers who are disabled,

00:45:32.685 --> 00:45:35.711
so of course they should also hire
disabled people

00:45:35.992 --> 00:45:39.971
who can help them with their products
in every step of the way.

00:45:41.176 --> 00:45:44.473
Not just in the end
with quality assurance,

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.782
but everywhere.

00:45:46.704 --> 00:45:49.895
I think
that's really important to notice

00:45:49.957 --> 00:45:52.253
that we are a society

00:45:52.324 --> 00:45:55.174
where people with disabilities exist

00:45:55.598 --> 00:46:01.907
and you also have to include them
in the process of creating products.

00:46:03.141 --> 00:46:04.221
Jeremy: Thank you.

00:46:05.335 --> 00:46:08.317
What made you think
about creating Barrier Area,

00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:12.098
and what did you take into consideration

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:15.231
when you were developing
some of the different sections?

00:46:17.882 --> 00:46:23.113
Olivia: I was thinking about,
what is the other way around?

00:46:23.856 --> 00:46:30.068
When people confront barriers
in their everyday life,

00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:35.005
what would be the opposite
for a non-disabled user?

00:46:36.588 --> 00:46:42.297
How can they also get this experience
of getting into a barrier,

00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:46.459
but in a way they normally browse,

00:46:48.064 --> 00:46:53.618
in a way how they use the internet
in their everyday life?

00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.717
Then they should just experience,

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:03.012
I can't get on to the next page
or whatever my goal is,

00:47:03.301 --> 00:47:05.385
and how can I make this into a game?

00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:07.449
In this case,

00:47:07.863 --> 00:47:10.067
for example, with a keyboard,

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.085
most pages, you can use a mouse
and it's really easy,

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:21.517
but sometimes a keyboard
doesn't work on a webpage.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.143
Now I thought,
what would be the opposite?

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:28.022
The opposite would be
that the mouse doesn't work,

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.211
but the keyboard does.

00:47:30.676 --> 00:47:31.876
That's how I did it.

00:47:32.322 --> 00:47:36.538
Or what would be the opposite
of missing alt text?

00:47:37.415 --> 00:47:40.134
It would be
that there's additional alt text

00:47:40.197 --> 00:47:43.322
that gives you additional information.

00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:46.693
That's how I thought about that.

00:47:47.267 --> 00:47:48.347
Jeremy: Thank you.

00:47:48.463 --> 00:47:50.158
Have you been able to test the site

00:47:50.253 --> 00:47:53.872
with people
who use keyboard predominantly?

00:47:56.521 --> 00:48:00.900
Olivia: With keyboard, not really,

00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:05.292
but I myself, of course,
tried the whole game with the keyboard.

00:48:05.552 --> 00:48:09.926
It's possible to play the whole game
with a keyboard

00:48:10.103 --> 00:48:15.427
and whenever you use a screen reader
in your everyday life,

00:48:15.779 --> 00:48:17.605
in this case, it works.

00:48:19.765 --> 00:48:24.373
Jeremy: Did you have
any final recommendations or any resources

00:48:24.444 --> 00:48:27.940
to help those
think more about your talk?

00:48:28.206 --> 00:48:29.337
Do you have a blog

00:48:29.415 --> 00:48:31.665
or do you have an about section
on a website?

00:48:33.571 --> 00:48:35.804
Olivia: I would say just play the game.

00:48:38.142 --> 00:48:41.646
Of course,
there you can find some information.

00:48:41.747 --> 00:48:46.205
It is some information for beginners

00:48:46.259 --> 00:48:48.637
about digital accessibility,

00:48:48.778 --> 00:48:52.698
what you have to think about
when creating a website,

00:48:53.499 --> 00:48:56.798
which barriers
are there or could be there,

00:48:57.165 --> 00:49:03.378
and so you be more aware
of these things, of the barriers.

00:49:04.904 --> 00:49:06.311
Jeremy: Thank you so much.

00:49:06.384 --> 00:49:08.473
I'm going to go close it out
with the chat,

00:49:08.551 --> 00:49:10.607
but we really appreciate your talk

00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:13.151
and we really appreciate
the demo of Barrier Area.

00:49:13.525 --> 00:49:15.205
Olivia: Thank you very much.

00:49:15.996 --> 00:49:19.196
Jeremy: Thank you for attending
this session with Olivia Richter.

00:49:19.296 --> 00:49:21.596

00:49:46.605 --> 00:49:47.605
Stay tuned for

00:49:47.982 --> 00:49:51.273
Built the website with an AI,
but is it accessible?

00:49:51.702 --> 00:49:55.951
