>> ANNABELLE DRUMM: Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.331
My name is Annabelle Drumm,
and I'm a knitwear designer

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.567
from DrummRoll Knitwear.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.969
Thank you for joining us
for the presentation,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.371
Accessibility isn't Extra Work.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.241
It's Risk Management,
with Jennifer Wjertzoch.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.344
Jennifer is a front-end engineer

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.213
specializing in the Vue ecosystem,

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.049
with a strong focus
on building scalable,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.788
high-performance,
and accessible web applications.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.024
She previously worked for Oetker
Digital, managing the migration

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.894
of more than 40 international
websites

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.998
to a modern contact
management system.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:17.102
At Jung von Matt TECH,
she created digital brand experiences

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:20.505
for clients such
as LichtBlick and Fehlmann,

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:23.141
focusing on performance optimization,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.511
accessibility,
and component-driven design

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.815
across multiple platforms.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.851
Currently, she works
at DKB Code Factory,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:37.022
building modular Vue front-ends
for financial products,

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:42.127
driving the Vue 3 migration,
shaping internal design systems,

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:45.130
and collaborating
with cross-functional teams

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:50.002
to deliver secure
and user-centric banking solutions.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.832
Beyond client projects,

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.483
she's actively contributing
to the web community

00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:57.909
through mentoring, public speaking,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.179
and writing about accessibility,
architecture,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.183
and front-end best practices.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.639
Please feel free
to add your questions

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.687
to the Zoom Q&A section,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.523
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:15.828
Welcome, Jennifer.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.032
>> JENNIFER WJERTZOCH: Okay.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.271
Today's topic
is Accessibility isn't Extra Work,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.875
It's Actually Risk Management.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:31.176
My name is Jennifer.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.311
I'm a senior front-end engineer

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:36.215
at DKB Code Factory here in Berlin,

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:40.519
and before I dive
into WordPress and accessibility,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.589
let me give you a quick
look where I come from,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.993
because each step
of my career shaped how I think

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.796
about digital products today.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.065
I actually didn't start at a startup.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.501
I started at Oetker Digital right

00:03:56.502 --> 00:04:01.374
inside a very
traditional German brand.

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:06.244
The job was here about
bringing classic products

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.783
that everyone knew and everyone
loved into the digital world.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.820
What I learned
there was how to translate

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.690
tradition into something
usable and modern.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.294
What we did was we built
one design system

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.629
that many teams could share.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:30.469
A design system is a great foundation
for built-in accessibility.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.939
Because if you get
the components right

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.776
once with proper semantics,
focus handling, error handling,

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.645
and keyboard support, then every team

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.348
that uses those components ships

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.785
accessibility features by default.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.256
Then I moved to an agency
called Jung von Matt.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:54.259
Agency life is a whole
different thing.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.527
It's fast.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:59.230
It is full of big clients
and well-known brands.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.569
It has tight deadlines
and way too many stakeholders,

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:07.573
but what I learned there was agile
software development,

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.943
so working in short iterations,

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.881
shipping fast, collecting feedback,
and then improving.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.485
That's also where I met
WordPress in practice,

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.187
and now I work in banking.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:26.558
That might sound dry at first,

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.994
but for me, it actually really fits,

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:34.000
because here, every feature
just has to tick the basics.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.567
It needs to be safe.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:39.071
It needs to be compliant,
and it needs to be accessible.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.143
At DKB, we don't see it
as extra work.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.212
It's simply part of our shipping.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.084
That keeps our teams relaxed,
and that gives users confidence.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.987
Why am I telling you this?

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:58.858
Because all of that is my bridge
to WordPress.

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:04.330
We all know WordPress
is powerful because it is open,

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:09.635
but that openness is also what makes
accessibility very tricky.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.206
You can build anything,
but you can also break anything,

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.842
but my idea is, what if you combine

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:22.147
the order of Oetker,
the speed of agency work,

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:25.351
and the compliance
mindset from the banking,

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:29.121
and then bring it into WordPress?

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:32.524
I believe that WordPress
projects run smoother.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.261
They are faster and also safer.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:39.732
Today I want to show you the small
habits that make that real.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:47.172
As I already said, in my daily work,
there's one simple rule.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:51.877
No feature goes live
without an accessibility review.

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:55.747
If a component isn't accessible,
it doesn't ship.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.684
That might sound strict,

00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:04.190
but in regulated industries
like banking, it's just normal.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.395
Every product decision
is also a compliance decision,

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:15.267
is also a governance decision,
and it is a risk decision.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.602
Accessibility isn't a nice-to-have;

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:21.607
it's part of the quality standards,

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.843
and that's where I see
a useful contrast.

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:29.818
Because WordPress runs more than 43%

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.130
of all websites worldwide,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.087
that's almost half of the internet,

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:40.592
and it powers universities,
public authorities, it powers banks,

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.893
and e-commerce shops.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.230
It is basically everywhere,

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:48.900
but in WordPress projects,
accessibility checks

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.903
are rarely a fixed
part of the process.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:56.074
They are not mandatory,
and that gap creates risks

00:07:56.075 --> 00:08:00.245
we could easily avoid
if we borrowed just a little bit

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.214
of that "nothing ships
without" habit.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.386
Let's look at some more numbers.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:13.458
According to the 2025 WebAIM
Million Report,

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:19.064
95% of homepages
still have accessibility errors.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:25.638
On average, that's
51 errors per page, 51,

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:29.174
and these errors
are not advanced or complicated;

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.443
they are just basics.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.665
Let's take a quick look
at the most common ones

00:08:35.696 --> 00:08:37.851
you find in WordPress projects.

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:41.252
There we have images
without alt text,

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:46.859
which means screen reader
users get no information at all.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.928
Then we have buttons
and links with no labels,

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:54.800
so assistive technology
can't tell what they do.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:57.135
We have the poor color contrast,

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:01.272
where text and background
don't meet the minimum ratio

00:09:01.273 --> 00:09:04.610
so that a lot
of people can't read it,

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:09.315
and keyboard navigation barriers,

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:13.985
so interactive elements
that don't work with the keyboard,

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:17.156
which excludes anyone
who doesn't use a mouse.

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.259
The important point here is,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.695
these problems are all easy to avoid.

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:27.432
They only happen
because accessibility isn't part

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.768
of the process from the beginning.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.204
If it is, you don't end up

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:36.508
with 51 errors on a page,
that's for sure.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:40.878
When people hear
the word "accessibility,"

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:43.514
they usually think about
screen reader support,

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.317
they think about color contrast,
and keyboard navigation.

00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:50.221
That's important,
but there is another word

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:53.459
that rarely gets mentioned,
and that is "risk."

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.427
Accessibility is not just
about quality;

00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:59.064
it is also about risk,

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:02.567
and in my work
in the financial industry,

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.937
I have seen how missing
accessibility creates,

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:11.644
actually, three
very real categories of risk.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:17.282
The first one is legal risk,
and that's a big one.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.551
WordPress sites
are actually frequent targets

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:24.456
as accessibility lawsuits
keep increasing every year.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.659
Then there's business risk.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:35.734
It's part of your audience
can't use your site.

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:38.403
You're basically leaving
money on the table.

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:43.008
You exclude users
and you lose market share,

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:46.612
and then finally,
there's the reputation risk.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.581
When a brand isn't accessible,
it loses trust,

00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:53.786
and people will always notice,

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:58.423
and these risks apply
as much to WordPress projects

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:02.494
as they do to other websites,
that's for sure.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.098
All right,
let's unpack them one by one.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.133
I'm starting with the legal risk.

00:11:09.134 --> 00:11:13.805
In Europe, we now have
the European Accessibility Act.

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:17.776
In Germany, the
Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.445
and in the US,
the American with Disabilities Act,

00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:23.615
or also called ADA,

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.452
and these laws no longer
apply only to governments.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.555
They also apply
to private companies now,

00:11:32.157 --> 00:11:34.159
and the lawsuits are real.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.263
According to the UsableNet
2025 Midyear report,

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:42.667
in just the first
6 months of the year,

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:47.672
there were already 2019 ADA
lawsuits filed against websites

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.141
and also apps, and video content,

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:56.148
and that's about 20% higher
than the same time last year.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:12:02.887
Yes, I would say 2025 is
on track to hit a new record

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.391
by the end of the year then.

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.227
Yes, and some of the defendants,
they are not small companies.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:12.498
We're talking about Domino's Pizza.

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:15.366
We're talking about Target, Netflix,

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:19.405
and even websites
like Beyonce's website.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:25.076
Domino's was sued because blind
users couldn't order pizza

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:30.181
through their site and app,
I guess, and the court upheld

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.584
their right to equal access.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.686
Target faced a major
lawsuit for the same reason.

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:39.124
Their website simply
didn't work for blind customers.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:43.795
Netflix got taken to court
for missing closed captions,

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:47.199
which excluded the viewers entirely.

00:12:47.866 --> 00:12:50.168
Beyonce's site, as I mentioned,

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:55.207
was sued because it wasn't accessible
to also blind users,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.443
and they have this one thing
all in common.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.978
They failed to provide accessibility,

00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:03.081
and it turned into a legal battle.

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.552
Then we have reputational risk,

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:11.056
and then here, let me tell you about

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:14.626
the Grayscale incident.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:19.397
It was April 2021,
and Prince Philip dies,

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:22.801
and the UK goes into mourning.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.670
Some people, they bring flowers

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.840
and they hold a minute of silence,

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:30.641
but what does the railway industry--?

00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:34.745
Well, they decide, "You know
what the nation needs right now?

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:36.747
A full website redesign."

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:41.853
Then, overnight, National Rail,
usually blue and yellow,

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:46.492
flip the entire train
system into black and white,

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:50.895
and then cross country
and Northern Rail,

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:54.298
they saw this and they thought,
"This is just brilliant.

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.833
Let's do the same."

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.636
Within hours, the whole rail network

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.673
was running in funeral mode,
and of course,

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:05.510
it was a disaster because white text

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.846
on a gray background,
you have no color anchors

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:13.819
to navigate, timetables
that were basically invisible,

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:19.558
made buying a ticket really confusing
and also very frustrating.

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:21.592
Of course, Twitter exploded.

00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:27.598
Users posted that "The country
has lost its mind,

00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:32.303
and this is a perfect
metaphor for UK Rail:

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:36.607
accessibility always an afterthought,
also trains still delayed."

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:42.080
Those were comments from users,

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:46.250
and you see the press picked it up,
and the RNIB,

00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:49.387
the Royal National
Institute of Blind People,

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.590
had to step
in and had to remind them,

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:56.027
contrast isn't a design choice;

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.730
it's basic usability.

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:00.998
Then, of course, after a few days,

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.868
National Rail backtracked,
they apologized,

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.403
they promised to do better,

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.539
but by then the damage
was already done,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.944
and that's reputational
risk in its purest form.

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:16.347
WordPress projects are not immune.

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:19.084
Many of them
are actually very visible.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.021
Of course, accessibility
is also a message.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:27.725
If your website has barriers,

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:32.164
the message to your users is,
"You are not welcome."

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:37.702
In the age of social media,
that message, as you know,

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:40.404
that spreads faster than ever,

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:44.208
and then nobody talks about
your new campaign anymore.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:49.114
They only talk about
your failure in inclusion.

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:56.388
The third category is business risk,
and this one hurts directly.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:02.727
Accessibility barriers
don't just exclude users;

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.230
they cost real money.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.200
Fewer people can access your service,

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:12.703
SEO rankings drop,
support calls go up,

00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:16.040
and the later you fix accessibility,

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.744
the more expensive it becomes.

00:16:19.544 --> 00:16:23.581
Forrester Research
actually quantified this:

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:27.819
late fixes can cost
up to 10 times more.

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:32.924
Yes, so let's make that a bit
more tangible.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:44.468
Imagine every accessibility issue
is a small bill waiting to be paid.

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:50.041
If you catch it early
in the design phase, it's about €5.

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:53.377
That's just a coffee
in Berlin these days,

00:16:53.378 --> 00:16:56.081
a small expense and easy to fix.

00:16:57.315 --> 00:17:00.051
Then, if you wait until development,

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.587
the same issue jumps to about €20.

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:06.792
That's lunch for one person
at a decent restaurant.

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:10.828
Manageable, but yes,
you already feel it.

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:15.342
If you wait until launch,

00:17:15.792 --> 00:17:18.712
suddenly you're at €50 or more,

00:17:18.713 --> 00:17:20.204
and that's dinner with wine,

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:23.875
I would say, and at that point,
the bill really hurts.

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.778
The rule is simple.

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.380
The longer you wait,
the more your bucks turn

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:33.018
into really expensive dining.

00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:39.224
Nobody wants to be accessibility
that kind of expensive, I guess,

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:46.430
and this is where WordPress
has its own set of challenges.

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:53.337
As I already said, it powers
more than 40% of the entire web,

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.940
which is incredible,
but that also makes

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:59.878
it a prime target for hackers
and for compliance issues.

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:05.984
One insecure plugin, just one,
can take down the entire site.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.952
Here's the thing:

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:11.055
compliance can't be a plugin,
and accessibility

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.090
can't be a plugin either.

00:18:13.658 --> 00:18:18.863
If you treat it like an add-on,
you're basically duct-taping risk

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:23.735
management onto a system
that was never designed for it,

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:27.004
and that approach
simply wouldn't hold up

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:28.506
in regulated industries.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.441
That's why, also, more and more banks

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.877
are moving away
from WordPress towards

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:35.946
platforms where compliance
and accessibility

00:18:35.947 --> 00:18:38.216
governance are built
in from the start.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:44.221
Let's step into a real project
for a moment,

00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:50.028
and then see what I call
the WordPress accessibility pattern.

00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:56.767
Because what looks
so easy on slides often looks

00:18:56.768 --> 00:19:02.874
very different in real life,
it usually starts with design.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:08.045
Designers hand over their work,
gorgeous Figma mockups,

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.514
perfect spacing, beautiful fonts.

00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:14.552
Everyone claps,
and then somebody says, "But wait,

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:17.121
where are the focus states?"

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:23.595
Designers just smile and go,
"Yes, we didn't design those."

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.363
Next slide.

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:28.533
Then comes feature development.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:34.572
Devs open Jira, deadline
was yesterday, so the job is clear.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.307
Make it look like the mockups,

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.243
make it clickable, and then ship it.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:42.213
Accessibility tickets,
they are in the backlog,

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:45.950
so the devs do what
we all do under pressure.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.818
They hard-code it until it works,

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.222
and then they pray nobody
asks too many questions.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:56.894
After that, content creation,
so now comes the fun part.

00:19:56.895 --> 00:20:00.130
Somebody gets the job
to move 400 pages

00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:02.433
of old content into WordPress.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.902
Copy, paste, publish,

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:07.504
and suddenly you get images
with no alt text,

00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:12.209
you have headings
jumping from H1 to H4, H6,

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.744
and then 10 different links

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:16.447
in the same page,
all saying, "Read more."

00:20:17.682 --> 00:20:21.852
The team says, "Just don't worry,
we'll clean that up later,"

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:25.456
and you all know
what that means later.

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:26.858
It means never.

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:32.396
Then, only at the very end,

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:36.367
the big moment, the site is ready,
the client is excited,

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.002
people bring snacks and champagne,

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:41.739
and everyone's exhausted but happy,
and then it always happens

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.975
that someone asks, "Wait, did anyone

00:20:44.976 --> 00:20:46.912
actually check accessibility?"

00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:50.080
Then the project manager smiles

00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:55.152
and says, "Haha, yes, we'll handle
that later in phase 2," which,

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:58.873
of course, is the code word for

00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:02.593
"This will never ever happen,"
and that's it.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.729
That's how so many WordPress

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.400
projects end up live
with accessibility issues,

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:13.771
not because anyone's evil,
just because real-life deadlines

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:19.044
and "We'll fix that later"
somehow always wins.

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:28.018
There are four major challenges
that I see again and again,

00:21:28.019 --> 00:21:32.823
and that's inconsistent
quality of themes and plugins.

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:35.192
We have continuous content updates

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.196
that quietly introduce new issues.

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:42.466
We have unclear
ownership across teams,

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:46.137
and the fact that content itself
needs to be understandable.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:50.675
Let's go through these one by one.

00:21:52.243 --> 00:21:56.246
Problem number 1: import bad code,
import barriers.

00:21:56.247 --> 00:22:00.218
This is where it usually starts
with themes and plugins.

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:07.458
WordPress core and also the official
accessibility ready themes

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:12.129
can be a quite solid foundation,
but once you step

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.799
into the world of community
themes and third-party plugins,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.004
quality becomes quite unpredictable.

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.523
Some are well-coded
with accessibility

00:22:21.524 --> 00:22:25.643
also in mind; many are not.

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:30.614
When experts audited popular
WordPress themes, over 70%

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:36.421
failed on basic accessibility
criteria out of the box.

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:43.427
This means if you start
with a poorly coded theme,

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:48.867
you inherit barriers from Day 1,
and I have seen it in practice.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.635
One example that really stuck with me

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:53.637
was a beautiful image slider.

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:58.743
It looked smooth,
it had animations, it had autoplay,

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:02.479
but it was completely
unusable for anyone

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.982
relying on a keyboard
or a screen reader.

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:08.987
It just had no focus indicators,
no pause functionality,

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:13.124
and yes, no meaningful labels.

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:19.629
Here, you could see, for the users,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.267
the slider wasn't a feature;
it was simply a wall.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.769
For business behind that website,

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.973
it was a compliant risk,
and that's what I mean

00:23:29.974 --> 00:23:34.679
when I say import bad code,
import accessibility problems.

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:40.150
The second big challenge
comes after launch.

00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:42.787
That's called content churn.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:48.358
WordPress lives and breathes content.

00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:52.062
Editors update pages, upload images.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:56.433
They publish blog posts,
they add banners for a campaign,

00:23:56.434 --> 00:24:01.171
and every one of these small changes

00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:05.043
can introduce
new accessibility issues.

00:24:05.376 --> 00:24:08.059
None of these things feel
dramatic when they happen,

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:11.616
but over the weeks,
as you can see in the diagram,

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:17.555
weeks and months, they accumulate
into quite serious barriers.

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:23.507
Studies have shown
that most accessibility issues

00:24:23.508 --> 00:24:26.363
on large sites
aren't coded at launch;

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:30.934
they are introduced afterwards
through everyday content updates,

00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:36.173
and I can confirm
this in practice when we audit sites

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:39.477
that were once delivered accessibly.

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.512
The problems we find later

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:45.850
usually come from content
and not from code.

00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:51.522
Yes, that's why accessibility
is never a one-time job;

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.659
it's an ongoing process.

00:24:56.194 --> 00:25:01.966
We have the third issue,
and this is ownership.

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:05.302
Who actually owns accessibility
in a WordPress project?

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:10.007
Is it a designer, developer,
content team, legal?

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:13.978
In most projects,
the answer is unclear.

00:25:14.345 --> 00:25:16.880
When responsibility is unclear,

00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:19.918
accessibility falls
through the cracks.

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:24.955
Designers assume
developers will do it.

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:28.592
Developers assume
content author will do it,

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:32.408
and then content authors
assume compliance will check it,

00:25:32.818 --> 00:25:35.666
and in the end,
nobody really does it.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:39.971
The reality is that
accessibility is shared.

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:44.141
If even one link
in this chain is weak,

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:48.513
the result will not be accessible.

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:54.586
Problem number 4
is actually my favorite one.

00:25:55.853 --> 00:25:58.822
The first point,
which often gets overlooked,

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:03.360
is that accessibility is not just
about code and design;

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:06.064
content itself must be accessible.

00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:10.401
That means it must be understandable.

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:16.673
The standards actually say this.

00:26:16.674 --> 00:26:21.578
There are criteria in WCAG
that require content to be written

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:24.781
at a lower secondary reading level

00:26:24.782 --> 00:26:27.986
or that unusual terms
must be explained.

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:29.027
Why?

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:31.922
Because language can be just as much

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:36.226
of a barrier as a missing label,
and we all know this experience.

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:42.333
Think of how financial websites
often use banking jargon.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.901
Think of terms like EZB license

00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:49.374
or SCA authentication,
or effective APR.

00:26:49.907 --> 00:26:52.843
If you don't live
in that world every day,

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:55.712
those words don't mean
anything to you.

00:26:55.713 --> 00:26:58.548
For people with cognitive
impairments,

00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:59.883
for people who don't speak

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:02.552
the language natively,
or simply for someone

00:27:02.553 --> 00:27:08.259
who is stressed or distracted,
jargon is a wall.

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:14.431
In Germany, government websites
are even required to provide

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:17.067
information in what's called
easy language,

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:22.139
simple, plain German,
because standard bureaucratic

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.609
language excludes many people,

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.912
and this doesn't apply
only to government.

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:31.381
If we want to reach our audience,

00:27:31.382 --> 00:27:34.052
our language must be open to them.

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:36.920
There's a small story.

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:41.459
There was a survey
about accessibility in 2025,

00:27:41.959 --> 00:27:43.727
and one participant

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:47.531
criticized the survey
itself for being written

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:50.133
in overly complicated language.

00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:53.470
They said the questions
were extremely complicated word.

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.973
Imagine an accessibility survey

00:27:56.974 --> 00:27:59.409
that was inaccessible in its wording.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.912
That's the risk when we forget

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:05.717
that language itself
is part of accessibility.

00:28:07.418 --> 00:28:09.753
That is why I believe accessibility

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:15.093
in WordPress projects must move
from optional to strategic.

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:18.228
It must be treated
like security or data

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:21.365
protection as something
you cannot skip.

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:24.716
If you want your product
to be safe and stable,

00:28:25.206 --> 00:28:27.872
and future-proof,
it cannot be skipped.

00:28:31.642 --> 00:28:36.880
I'm going to give you a way
of working that fits into real teams

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:42.119
with real deadlines,
and it has three ideas.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.389
None of them is revolutionary.

00:28:44.922 --> 00:28:47.992
All of them
are very powerful together.

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:51.129
I want to start with the first idea.

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:55.032
The first idea is the supply chain.

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.968
What is supply chain management?

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.970
Well,

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.674
think about your morning coffee.

00:29:04.675 --> 00:29:07.378
For that one cup to land

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:10.814
on your desk,
a whole chain has to work.

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:13.384
Beans are grown, harvested,

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:17.254
roasted, shipped, ground, brewed,

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:20.224
and then finally poured
into your mug.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:25.762
If any part of that chain breaks,
moldy beans,

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:28.031
or you have a bad roasting,
dirty machine,

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.699
that end product suffers,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.737
and you might not even want
to drink that coffee.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.041
WordPress has its own supply chain,

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:44.048
and that's themes and plugins,
and these are our dependencies.

00:29:44.615 --> 00:29:47.284
In security,
we all know how it works.

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.152
You check them
before you integrate them.

00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:51.288
You don't just trust random code

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.491
from the internet,
but when it comes to accessibility,

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:56.927
that discipline somehow disappears.

00:29:56.928 --> 00:30:01.431
We Google best slider, WordPress,

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:05.101
pick the one that looks nicest,
and hope that it's fine;

00:30:05.102 --> 00:30:09.440
it's going to be fine,
but it's usually not.

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:13.443
That's why I suggest a little,
one-minute gate

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:17.514
at the door before you adopt
any theme or plugin.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:20.618
Spend 60 seconds with a keyboard.

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:29.993
Can I tap through
all the interactive elements,

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:32.763
and does the order make sense?

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:38.769
Can I activate buttons
and links using enter or space?

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:44.007
Can I close modals
or drop-downs with escape?

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:47.777
Is the focus always
visible and clear?

00:30:47.778 --> 00:30:52.368
If it fails, if it fails
any of these, you don't import it

00:30:52.878 --> 00:30:57.889
or you fix it before
it even ever hits production,

00:30:59.123 --> 00:31:01.712
but that's supply
chain risk management

00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:03.827
for accessibility, and it takes

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:06.364
less than brewing that cup of coffee.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:12.802
If you only take one thing from today
before installing a plugin,

00:31:12.803 --> 00:31:14.337
tap through it once.

00:31:14.338 --> 00:31:18.242
If you lose your focus,
your users will, too.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.212
The second idea
is to make accessibility

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:25.749
binding in development,
the same way tests are binding.

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:30.921
We already block merges
on failing unit tests.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:35.058
Do the same for
critical accessibility errors.

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:37.827
There are tools, we have Axe-Core.

00:31:37.828 --> 00:31:40.997
We have PA11Y,
that you can run in your CI pipeline,

00:31:40.998 --> 00:31:43.500
and when a developer removes

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:48.873
an accessible name from a button,
the CI says, "No,

00:31:50.474 --> 00:31:53.910
that's actually not a moral judgment.

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:58.582
It's simply how we keep quality in,
how we always did."

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:03.453
yes, automated tools
don't catch everything.

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:06.356
They catch the easy stuff,
but they catch

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:07.958
the easy stuff reliably.

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:11.162
That's exactly
what we want a gate to do.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:18.469
The third idea is something
we call Defense in Depth.

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:22.873
Because if accessibility
isn't everywhere, it ends up nowhere.

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:28.412
It is about building
multi-layered protection,

00:32:28.879 --> 00:32:32.682
integrating accessibility
across every phase.

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:36.753
In the concept phase, you define
the patterns that will be used,

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:40.824
not just how they look,
but how they behave for keyboard

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:43.027
and screen reader users.

00:32:45.896 --> 00:32:47.631
This is what Defense in Depth looks

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:51.302
like in the concept and design phase.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:59.042
It starts with defining
accessible patterns,

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:03.480
and that means deciding
early how components behave,

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.383
not just how they look.

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:13.658
It means, how does
the keyboard move through them?

00:33:13.924 --> 00:33:15.726
What does the screen reader announce,

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:19.396
and then how does
interaction stay consistent

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:21.032
across the whole site?

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:24.367
This gives your product
a logical order

00:33:24.368 --> 00:33:28.538
and structure,
so users always know where they are,

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:30.574
no matter how they navigate.

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:34.912
The next layer is checking contrast.

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.814
That's where you test
your brand palette

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.816
on real backgrounds,
not just in Figma.

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:43.121
You make sure text
is actually readable

00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:45.388
for people with low vision

00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:48.191
and that interactive
elements like buttons

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:51.633
or links have enough
contrast to stand out,

00:33:52.652 --> 00:33:56.532
and then, finally,
purposeful focus states.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:34:00.226
This is where you design
the keyboard focus intentionally,

00:34:00.568 --> 00:34:02.606
not as an afterthought.

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:07.077
You make active
elements visually clear,

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:09.713
and you help keyboard users track

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.616
where they are in the page
at any moment.

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:19.023
When you combine
these three predictable patterns,

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:24.194
solid contrast,
and visible focus, you build

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.614
the foundation
for everything that follows

00:34:26.615 --> 00:34:29.733
in development or QA, or content.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:32.302
It's how you make accessibility part

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:36.640
of the DNA and not an add-on later.

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:41.911
Finally, let's talk about
content and editorial,

00:34:41.912 --> 00:34:44.547
because even the best design system

00:34:44.548 --> 00:34:49.519
can't save you if the content
team doesn't know how to use it.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.330
That's why a short
one-hour editor training

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.696
can make a massive difference.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:04.768
In that hour,
you cover just three simple things.

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:10.074
That's alt text, how to write clear,
descriptive text for images;

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.408
headings, how to structure content

00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:16.409
logically with proper
hierarchy; and link text,

00:35:16.689 --> 00:35:23.587
how to make links meaningful
instead of just "Click here."

00:35:24.488 --> 00:35:27.824
It's not about turning editors
into accessibility experts;

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:30.493
it's about giving them
the awareness to avoid

00:35:30.494 --> 00:35:36.300
breaking accessibility by accident.

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:42.839
Then, inside Gutenberg,
you can integrate

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.489
small accessibility checkers like

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:51.289
a heading hierarchy
checker that warns

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.386
when someone jumps
from an H2 straight to an H4.

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:59.323
When you do this,

00:36:02.526 --> 00:36:04.861
when you train
your editors and give them

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:08.732
the right tools,
three really good things happen.

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:12.535
First, you make
the good way the easy way.

00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:15.538
Accessibility stops
feeling like extra work.

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:18.142
It just becomes the normal workflow.

00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:20.984
Second, you reduce regressions

00:36:20.985 --> 00:36:24.080
because people stop
breaking things accidentally.

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:28.285
They start catching small
issues before they snowball.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.790
Third, you create a culture
of accessibility awareness.

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.527
It's not just one person
checking compliance anymore;

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:42.131
it's everyone quietly
doing their part day by day.

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:45.702
That's what long-term accessibility
really looks like.

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.404
Because in the end,

00:36:48.572 --> 00:36:51.674
accessibility isn't just
code or design;

00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:54.677
it's human, and
the human factor in content

00:36:54.678 --> 00:36:59.650
creation is what makes accessibility
sustainable in the long run.

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:06.257
There's one more ingredient
that makes all of this real,

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.425
and that's ownership.

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:14.932
Somebody has to connect all the dots,

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.533
not to do all the work,
but to make sure

00:37:17.534 --> 00:37:19.903
the process actually runs end-to-end.

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:25.875
In many teams, we call
that person the accessibility lead.

00:37:37.759 --> 00:37:38.578
Let me go.

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:39.522
Okay.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.993
They start with pattern
accessibility, making sure

00:37:43.994 --> 00:37:48.031
that the patterns we design
actually work for everyone,

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.334
both in UI and in the code.

00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:54.570
Then they oversee CI gate monitoring,

00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:57.607
ensuring that automated
accessibility tests

00:37:57.608 --> 00:38:00.543
are actually running
in the continuous

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:04.247
integration pipeline,
and that they block merge

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.282
when something breaks.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.185
Next comes QA process verification.

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:12.822
They make sure
there's a real screen reader

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:16.392
and also keyboard check during QA,

00:38:16.393 --> 00:38:21.764
not just "Looks fine
on Chrome. Perfect."

00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:25.703
Then there's the clear communication.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.439
They guide the team.

00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:31.474
They share learnings
and keep accessibility

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:36.079
visible instead
of buried in Jira tickets,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.448
and finally, training.

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:42.151
They are organizing short,
role-specific sessions

00:38:42.152 --> 00:38:44.020
so that designers, developers,

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:48.759
and editors each understand
their part in the chain.

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:53.096
This role doesn't mean doing
everything alone, like I said.

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:56.967
It means protecting continuity,

00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:00.671
because if nobody owns accessibility,

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:04.807
it becomes a beautiful idea
that slowly fades

00:39:04.808 --> 00:39:07.144
the moment a project ships.

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:12.683
Yes, the accessibility
lead keeps it alive.

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.220
We've talked about the risks.

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:20.423
Now let's look
at how to make accessibility part

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:21.692
of your daily workflow.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.461
Accessibility in WordPress

00:39:25.462 --> 00:39:28.664
doesn't have to be some big,
scary topic.

00:39:28.665 --> 00:39:32.069
At the end of a project,

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:38.188
it's just another part
of building something

00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:40.143
that actually works for everyone.

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:43.112
When you check your supply chain,

00:39:43.113 --> 00:39:47.183
you stop broken
plugins or sketchy themes

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:49.420
before they ever reach production.

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:53.122
When you add CI gates,
accessibility becomes part

00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:55.892
of your normal quality checks,

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.429
right next to performance
and security.

00:39:58.595 --> 00:40:00.663
Defense in Depth just means

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:03.766
it's not one lonely checklist
at the end.

00:40:03.767 --> 00:40:06.703
It's built into every phase,

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:12.776
into design and dev, QA,
content, all working together.

00:40:13.343 --> 00:40:15.912
Ownership is what keeps it alive.

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.313
We just discovered that.

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:19.782
Someone in the team
who just quietly makes

00:40:19.783 --> 00:40:24.321
sure things don't fall apart,
not the accessibility police.

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:25.488
That's not what I mean.

00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:29.126
More like the person
who keeps the rhythm going.

00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:34.597
Then there's the human touch,
the part no plugin can do.

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:38.367
It's the editor
who writes proper alt text,

00:40:38.368 --> 00:40:40.837
the designer who adds
visible focus states,

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:46.094
and the dev who fixes
that one annoying issue because,

00:40:46.484 --> 00:40:49.279
well, yes, it's just
the right thing to do.

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:54.317
We've talked about design,
development, content, and ownership.

00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:57.753
If there's one thing
I hope you take away,

00:40:57.754 --> 00:41:03.059
it's that accessibility isn't
something you just sprinkle on top;

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.963
it's something you build
in from the start.

00:41:07.916 --> 00:41:10.542
Yes, I've seen accessibility
from every angle,

00:41:10.583 --> 00:41:13.136
from brand websites
to banking systems,

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.438
and the pattern is always the same.

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:19.510
When teams own it,
everything else just works.

00:41:20.043 --> 00:41:25.381
As we wrap up, that's the rhythm
I'd love to see more,

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:27.751
and WordPress teams get into,

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:31.521
not perfection, just consistency,

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:35.092
because that's
where the magic happens.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.081
Yes, thanks for listening

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.966
and for actually
caring about this stuff.

00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:45.401
I would say you are already ahead

00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:46.701
of most of the internet

00:41:46.702 --> 00:41:48.839
because you are here,
you are listening,

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.807
and you are learning.

00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:54.144
All right, yes, let's open it up.

00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:56.812
What do you want to challenge?

00:41:56.813 --> 00:41:59.283
What would you like to add or ask?

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:03.053
I'm open to every question.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.947
Thank you.

00:42:04.997 --> 00:42:05.997
Jennifer: Thank you.

00:42:06.547 --> 00:42:08.357
Annabelle: Thank you so much, Jennifer.

00:42:08.357 --> 00:42:10.907
We've got quite a few questions,
so we're going to have

00:42:10.907 --> 00:42:13.487
to probably give you a quick fire.

00:42:13.565 --> 00:42:14.175
[laughs]

00:42:14.205 --> 00:42:17.867
I need some really succinct answers
in some of these questions.

00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:20.446
Let's start at the beginning.

00:42:20.536 --> 00:42:21.917
You mentioned plugins.

00:42:22.157 --> 00:42:26.207
Could you say a word
on A11y overlay plugins

00:42:26.266 --> 00:42:29.086
like Eye-Able and similar suspects?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.840
Jennifer: Yes.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.766
That's a good question, actually.

00:42:34.097 --> 00:42:35.686
Maybe I explain,

00:42:35.716 --> 00:42:37.847
not everybody knows what this is.

00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:42.376
Overlays like Eye-Able
they are little scripts

00:42:42.797 --> 00:42:46.335
or browser add-ons that sit
on the top of the website,

00:42:46.336 --> 00:42:50.477
and they try
to make it then automatically accessible

00:42:51.766 --> 00:42:53.177
like changing colors,

00:42:54.146 --> 00:42:55.966
also adding text to speech,

00:42:55.967 --> 00:42:58.577
I guess,
and also fake keyboard navigation.

00:42:59.897 --> 00:43:03.887
That's actually the problem
because they don't actually fix

00:43:03.947 --> 00:43:05.170
the code underneath,

00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:10.915
so that screen readers
and these assistive technologies

00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:14.686
they still can't use
the site properly.

00:43:15.353 --> 00:43:19.816
In many cases, they even hide
the real accessibility issues.

00:43:20.927 --> 00:43:25.366
That's also why regulators
they don't accept them

00:43:25.606 --> 00:43:26.836
as compliance.

00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:29.297
Real accessibility

00:43:30.047 --> 00:43:33.437
really has to be built into the product,
into the code,

00:43:33.637 --> 00:43:36.776
and not pasted over it at the end.

00:43:38.136 --> 00:43:41.610
Annabelle: There's another A11y question
here as well regarding that

00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:43.098
and gendered speech.

00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:44.987
Do you have any recommendations?

00:43:49.348 --> 00:43:50.868
Jennifer: I don't get.

00:43:50.896 --> 00:43:55.396
Really in form of technologies or--?

00:43:55.397 --> 00:43:56.446
Annabelle: I'll read the full thing.

00:43:56.446 --> 00:44:02.477
Regarding A11y and gendered speech,
also with a peek at the German situation,

00:44:02.866 --> 00:44:04.305
do you have recommendations?

00:44:04.306 --> 00:44:05.589
A lot of German approaches

00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:09.226
for gender neutral speech
increase complexity.

00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:11.652
Is there any approach you can recommend?

00:44:11.808 --> 00:44:12.808
Jennifer: Oh, okay.

00:44:13.896 --> 00:44:15.149
Also, a very good point.

00:44:16.127 --> 00:44:23.176
I also have a very personal opinion
on that because in German,

00:44:23.177 --> 00:44:28.846
many gender inclusive forms make
text harder for screen readers or people

00:44:28.847 --> 00:44:30.287
with cognitive disabilities.

00:44:30.887 --> 00:44:36.361
My rule of thumbs is always clarity
first and then inclusion second.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:42.857
It's also how I tried in the talk,
it's always about balance.

00:44:43.216 --> 00:44:45.287
If the gender breaks readability,

00:44:45.886 --> 00:44:47.417
it's not accessible anymore.

00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.777
You have to see from case to case.

00:44:53.116 --> 00:44:56.837
Annabelle: Kwaku asks,
"Is accessibility part of graphic design?"

00:44:58.456 --> 00:45:02.955
You would think accessible visibility
would be a foundational to graphics

00:45:02.956 --> 00:45:07.277
and design, especially with respect
to visibility due to contrast,

00:45:07.517 --> 00:45:11.716
or is accessibility lacking even
from a scholastic point of view?

00:45:14.857 --> 00:45:15.907
Jennifer: Absolutely.

00:45:16.096 --> 00:45:17.666
Contrast typography,

00:45:17.667 --> 00:45:21.395
and layout they are
all part of accessibility.

00:45:21.765 --> 00:45:26.325
Unfortunately, many design schools
they still teach aesthetics

00:45:26.326 --> 00:45:30.415
first, and then they skip
the inclusive part.

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:35.265
We always have a lot of discussions
with our design department about this

00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:42.244
because they are at the very first step
in developing something new.

00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:50.986
They also have the big challenge to think
accessibility from that point also.

00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:52.756
It's a long process.

00:45:52.757 --> 00:45:57.788
I think if we don't teach it,
it takes a long way.

00:45:57.868 --> 00:46:02.897
We carry it into the companies
and also in the mindsets of designers.

00:46:04.686 --> 00:46:06.347
Still a long way to go, I guess.

00:46:06.592 --> 00:46:08.320
[chuckles]
Annabelle: [laughs]

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.577
We have more questions than we have time.

00:46:10.757 --> 00:46:14.446
Perhaps, if anybody else wants
to add more questions,

00:46:14.716 --> 00:46:17.446
then Jennifer can answer those later,
but I'll just ask you one,

00:46:17.446 --> 00:46:18.446
which is fun.

00:46:18.586 --> 00:46:22.006
What's the worst argument
to not prioritize

00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:24.207
accessibility you've ever heard
from someone?

00:46:25.637 --> 00:46:27.587
Jennifer: I had the same idea like you.

00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:31.605
I want to answer this question
because it's my favorite one,

00:46:31.606 --> 00:46:36.256
because I hear that all the time,
probably it's we don't have users

00:46:36.257 --> 00:46:40.156
with disabilities or we don't have
employees with disabilities.

00:46:41.047 --> 00:46:42.587
It goes on and on.

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:43.906
I think it's like

00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:47.417
saying we don't have mobile users
because your site doesn't work

00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:48.417
on a mobile phone.

00:46:49.157 --> 00:46:50.267
You exclude people.

00:46:50.687 --> 00:46:52.096
That's simply as it is.

00:46:52.097 --> 00:46:55.967
If you tell them you're not welcome,
I said that in the talk,

00:46:56.766 --> 00:46:58.786
that can be an argument.

00:46:59.136 --> 00:47:01.237
[laughter]

00:47:01.238 --> 00:47:02.806
Annabelle: That's a fun one to finish.

00:47:02.806 --> 00:47:05.026
Jennifer: I really like that one too.

00:47:06.186 --> 00:47:07.546
Annabelle: Thank you so much, Jennifer.

00:47:07.546 --> 00:47:10.168
That's been a really wonderful talk.
Jennifer: Thank you.

00:47:10.168 --> 00:47:12.991
Annabelle: I also want to thank
our support team as well

00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:18.016
who have helped us put these sessions
together all the way through the 24 hours,

00:47:18.077 --> 00:47:20.177
not just the ones that are here right now.

00:47:20.326 --> 00:47:22.156
You can continue the conversation

00:47:22.877 --> 00:47:25.994
around all of the different sessions
that you were hearing

00:47:26.026 --> 00:47:27.026
in this event

00:47:27.336 --> 00:47:34.621
on social media using #WPA11yDay.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.187
Another hashtag is WPAD2025.

00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:42.981
We'd also really appreciate it
if you could go

00:47:43.032 --> 00:47:52.282
to 2025 WP accessibility.day/feedback
to provide anonymous feedback

00:47:52.283 --> 00:47:54.233
for our speakers in their presentation.

00:47:54.617 --> 00:47:57.166
You can enter to win
a t-shirt while you're there.

00:47:57.677 --> 00:48:03.467
Stay tuned for The Art of Accessibility:
Making Documents Delightfully Inclusive
