00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.179
Vanessa Tillemans
is the founder of POURPIS,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.532

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.369
to protect businesses
from costly lawsuits

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.639
and lead the next generation

level fixes into true
digital protection.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.709
Vanessa focuses on what impacts
thousands of businesses each year,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.179
the high-risk accessibility
violations that lead to litigation.

Vanessa Tillemans: Hi, everyone.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.279
I'm so glad you're here today.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.419
The title of my talk

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.819
is Accessibility
Lawsuits and WordPress,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.232
the Violations Every
Business Needs to Know.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.949
Here's where we're headed today.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.319
We'll start with a little bit
about me and my company,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.569
so you know the perspective
I'm coming from.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.739
Then we'll zoom out
for a legal overview,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.679
what the current
landscape looks like,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.799
and how accessibility
lawsuits actually work.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.559
From there, we'll dig
into how websites are being targeted

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.329
and the impact on businesses,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.839
especially when those lawsuits
hit WordPress sites.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.891
Next, we'll look closely
at the violations

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:23.729
that come up again
and again in these cases.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.799
I'll share some thoughts
on what you can do

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.829
and also what you can't
do to manage your risk.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.689
And finally, we'll wrap up by looking

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.969
at the future of digital
accessibility law

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.529
with both federal and state actions
that are shaping what comes next.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.749
By the end, my goal
is that you'll walk away

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.279
with a clear understanding

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.609
of why these lawsuits keep happening,
what's driving them,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.329
and the practical steps
you can take to stay ahead.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.179
My name is Vanessa Tillemans,
and I'm the founder of POURPIS,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.579
a company I started with one mission,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.509
to make the web more accessible
and protect businesses.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.399
I was working as
a freelance web developer

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.979
when I first encountered
digital accessibility,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.499
and that happened through a lawsuit.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.919
What surprised me wasn't just
that a lawsuit was filed,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.986
but who was sued and why.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.079
That experience completely
changed my perspective

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.509
on websites and showed me how serious

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.410
and widespread this issue really is.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.249
Before launching my company,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.649
I earned certifications
in accessibility

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.859
from the International Association
of Accessibility Professionals

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.959
and in website accessibility testing

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.019
from the US Department
of Homeland Security.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.929
Because I've always been fascinated
by the legal side of things,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.079
I began following accessibility
lawsuits closely,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.589
and that perspective shapes
how I approach my work today.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.169
It's why I stay tuned
in to the legal landscape

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.079
and why I'm here sharing
these insights with you.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.509
Quick disclaimer, I'm not a lawyer.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.819
So while this talk
focuses on lawsuits,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.289
I can't keep you out of court,
but I can help you reduce your risk

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.389
so you're never in that position.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.479
Also, this slide does
have some meaningful images.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.059
It shows a photo of me,
along with the logos

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.239
for the International Association
of Accessibility Professionals

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.389
and the US Department
of Homeland Security.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.829
Let's get right into it.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.349
In 1990, on the South Lawn
of the White House,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.349
the Americans with Disabilities
Act was signed into law.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.809
This wasn't just
another piece of legislation.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.749
The ADA was the first
comprehensive civil rights law

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.449
for people with disabilities
anywhere in the world.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.879
It outlawed discrimination
in employment,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.119
transportation, public
accommodations, communications,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.939
and access to government
programs and services.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.734
Back in 1990, however,

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:36.869
we were on the brink
of a transformation

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.199
that would change
everything, the internet.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.319
No one could have imagined
it would soon shape how we shop,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.659
how we learn, and how we connect.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.969
The ADA, groundbreaking as it was,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.249
never even mentioned
websites or apps,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.058
and that gap is what opened
the door to lawsuits.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.789
It started with
the Target case in 2006.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.279
The National Federation
of the Blind sued Target

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.339
because blind customers
couldn't shop independently

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.020
on Target's website.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.189
Think about this.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.629
Images with no alt text,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.909
menus that couldn't be navigated
with a keyboard,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.699
and checkout forms that literally
prevented some people

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.319
from being able to make a purchase.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.359
Here's why this case mattered.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.439
It was the first major class-action
digital accessibility lawsuit.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.169
The court ruled
the ADA does apply online

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.719
when a site is tied
to a physical store.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.621
Target settled in 2008.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.247
They paid $6 million,
committed to follow

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.409
the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.179
and agreed to years of monitoring

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.729
by the National
Federation of the Blind.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.419
For the first time, a retailer was
legally forced to fix its website.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.279
This wasn't just a slap on the wrist.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.849
This case set the stage
for everything that came after.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.586
Fast forward to 2019.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.049
Domino's Pizza didn't just
face a lawsuit,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.539
they fought it tooth
and nail for six years.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.369
A blind customer couldn't order food

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.039
on their website or app
with a screen reader.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.899
Rather than addressing
the issue directly,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.139
Domino's chose to challenge
the legal interpretation.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.089
They argued that the ADA never said

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.699
it applied to websites,
and even if it did,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.669
it didn't say how
to make a site compliant.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.122
They spent years in court
filing appeals and racking up

00:07:12.123 --> 00:07:14.969
what had to have been
a massive legal bill.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.369
The Ninth Circuit ruled
against Domino's.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.019
They appealed to the Supreme Court,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.479
but the court refused
to even hear the case,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.969
and that silence spoke volumes.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.799
The Domino's decision confirmed

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.589
that the ADA extends
to websites and apps.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.089
In the years that followed,

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.549
digital accessibility
lawsuits rose sharply

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.619
as courts and plaintiffs reinforced

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.409
this interpretation
across the country.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.694
Then, in 2024, 34 years
after the ADA first became law,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.999
it was finally updated
to address websites and apps.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.889
The US Department of Justice updated

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.369
the ADA to explicitly
require public entities,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.099
not just state and local governments,
but also hospitals,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.639
schools, police departments,
libraries, transit systems,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.419
to make their websites and apps
accessible with a firm deadline.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.539
They also said how you
do this, by complying

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.885
with the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.739
or WCAG for short.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.529
This update only
applies to public entities.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.069
Private businesses aren't covered,
at least not yet.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.199
That gap is exactly why lawsuits

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.989
against private
businesses keep piling up.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.659
While Congress debates
and agencies write rules,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.999
the courts are where these battles
are being fought,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.559
and that means one thing.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.169
If you want to understand
accessibility lawsuits,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.189
you have to understand
the legal foundation behind them.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.869
Right now, web accessibility lawsuits

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.415
are at an all-time
high across the US,

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:39.989
with over 5,000 lawsuits
expected to be filed this year.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.099
That makes understanding

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.464
the legal foundation critical,
because without it,

00:08:43.465 --> 00:08:46.019
you can't understand
why some lawsuits stick

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.639
and others get tossed out.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.739
For any accessibility
lawsuit to move forward

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.319
in federal court,
the plaintiff has to establish

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.409
standing under Article 3
of the Constitution.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.299
Article 3 is what gives
federal courts

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.059
the power to hear
cases and controversies.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.239
That phrase, cases
and controversies, is key.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.279
It means courts can't just weigh

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.549
in on abstract disagreements
or hypotheticals.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.459
They can only decide disputes
where there's an actual,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.872
live conflict that affects
someone directly.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.679
That's where standing comes in.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.249
Standing is the legal gatekeeper
for who gets to bring a case.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.099
If a plaintiff can't show
they've been directly affected,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.709
the court likely won't hear the case.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.579
To establish standing,
plaintiffs must prove three things.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.859
The first is actual or imminent harm.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.829
They must show that they personally
suffered concrete harm,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.119
not just annoyance that a website
was inconvenient or hard to use.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.589
Next is causation.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.089
There has to be a direct link

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.239
between their harm
and the barriers on the website.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.029
Likelihood of future
harm is also a requirement.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.039
They must prove
they're likely to encounter

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.889
those same barriers
again if they return.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.039
Courts often look
for one more element,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.909
intent to purchase or return.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.129
Just browsing a site isn't enough.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.319
Plaintiffs need to show
genuine interest

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.649
that they wanted to buy something,
sign up, or use the services.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.769
Without that, courts
might dismiss the case.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.799
This is what's known
as the proof of harm requirement.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.469
Courts have increasingly
ruled that simply saying

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.049
I couldn't access
the website isn't enough.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.303
There has to be
real-world harm behind it.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.619
For example, in one case,
a blind plaintiff sued

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.409
a university over their
inaccessible website.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.829
The court dismissed
it because he wasn't a student there,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.589
and he didn't have
any intent to enroll.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.690
No harm, no standing.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.725
No standing means no court case.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.089
The big takeaway here is this.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.449
Not every lawsuit makes
it through the courthouse doors.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.819
Plaintiffs need to satisfy
these conditions

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.369
before the court
will consider the claim.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.659
But here's the key.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.029
The bar isn't as high
as you might think.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.039
If someone can show
they genuinely wanted

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.469
to access your website
to read about your company,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.299
make a purchase, schedule a service,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.759
sign up for a newsletter,
or use your app,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.369
and they were blocked
by accessibility barriers,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.499
that's often enough for standing.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.709
Standing is what gives
a lawsuit real traction.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.799
While some cases get tossed,
plenty move forward.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.099
That's why businesses
can't afford to ignore accessibility.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.039
Because when plaintiffs
can show clear intent and harm,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.829
courts are likely to allow
the case to proceed.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.499
In short, standing isn't automatic.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.059
It's built on evidence.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.849
But when that evidence exists,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.989
accessibility barriers become
a strong legal risk for businesses.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.399
Now that we've talked about standing,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.559
let's move to Title III of the ADA,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.739
the part of the law that covers
public accommodations.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.799
In simple terms,
Title III applies to businesses

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.109
and nonprofits that serve the public.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.779
Hotels, restaurants,
stores, theaters,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.799
hospitals, schools, museums,
and other places open to the public.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.219
If it serves the public,
it's a public accommodation.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.869
Here's the big question.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.689
Do websites count
as public accommodations?

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.494
Some courts say yes,

00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:03.209
but only if the website is directly
tied to a physical business.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.639
That's called the nexus requirement.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.119
Nexus just means a connection.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.909
If a blind customer
can't order from an online store

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.869
that also has a physical location,
that's a nexus case.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.779
The problem is courts
don't all agree.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.779
The US is divided
into 13 federal circuits,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.969
each with its own Court of Appeals.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.879
That's the level just
below the Supreme Court.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.399
These circuits cover
different regions of the country,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.459
and they don't always
interpret the law the same way.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.719
Here's how it works.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.909
Cases usually start
in a district court,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.999
where a judge hears
the case and makes a ruling.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.239
If one side disagrees,
they can appeal to the circuit court.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.759
Circuit courts don't hold new trials.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.889
Instead, a panel of judges reviews

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.459
whether the law was applied
correctly, and once they decide,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.469
that ruling becomes binding precedent

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.719
for every state in that circuit.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.599
When we talk about the Ninth
Circuit or the Third Circuit,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.939
we're really talking
about appellate courts

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.843
that shape how the ADA is applied

00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:03.959
across entire regions of the country.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.699
For example, the Ninth Circuit,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.099
which covers states
like California, Arizona,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.481
and Washington, has often
ruled that websites themselves

00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:13.889
can qualify as public accommodations.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.929
We saw this in the Domino's case.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.379
A blind customer couldn't order
from their website or app.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.867
The district court
dismissed the case,

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:24.089
saying the ADA didn't apply.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.689
But when it was appealed,
the Ninth Circuit disagreed,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.791
ruling that digital
experiences connected

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:33.379
to physical businesses
are covered under the ADA.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.489
Domino's appealed
to the Supreme Court,

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.529
but the court declined to hear it,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.379
letting the Ninth
Circuit's decision stand.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.299
That's the power of the circuits.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.299
Their rulings ripple
across entire regions,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.619
and unless the Supreme Court steps
in, they set the law of the land.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.139
Whether your website counts
as a public accommodation

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.689
can depend on where
the lawsuit is filed.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.889
In some circuits, a website
may fall under ADA Title III.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.873
In others, it might not.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.239
That uncertainty has fueled thousands

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.849
of lawsuits because
plaintiffs often file

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.629
in courts most favorable
to accessibility claims.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.019
I don't think this uncertainty
will last forever, though.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.712
Right now, Congress
is considering a bill

00:14:15.713 --> 00:14:18.149
that would establish
clear nationwide rules

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.069
for digital accessibility.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.369
Later in this talk, I'll walk
you through what that bill says

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.539
and why it could rewrite the rules
for every business in America.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.509
Now let's look at where these
lawsuits are actually landing.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.629
In 2023, nearly 4,000
businesses were sued

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.399
for inaccessible websites,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.559
and more than half
of those lawsuits targeted

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.950
just two platforms,
Shopify and WordPress.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.180
Shopify topped the list
with 1,378 lawsuits.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.639
That's over a third of all cases.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.200
WordPress came next with 700
lawsuits, nearly 1 in 5.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.709
Together, they accounted
for over half

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.409
of all web accessibility
lawsuits that year.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.849
That's not coincidence.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.586
It's a clear pattern.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.079
Plaintiffs are focusing
on e-commerce,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.479
where barriers are easier to prove.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.733
Shopify and WordPress
dominate that space,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.599
powering millions of online stores.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.629
Because these websites
are often template-driven

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.109
and plugin-heavy, they're prone
to accessibility issues,

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.749
making them frequent legal targets.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.339
E-commerce sites are especially

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.979
vulnerable because
the harm is concrete.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.469
If a customer
can't complete a purchase,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.406
that's a measurable denial of access.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.259
If your business runs
on Shopify or WordPress,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.409
you're operating
on the platforms most often named

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:42.269
in lawsuits, as they're used
by so many businesses in e-commerce.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.059
Remember, e-commerce
isn't just a convenience.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.789
It's today's main entry
point for shopping.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.659
When access is blocked,
it's not just a compliance problem.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.829
It's a barrier to participation
in the modern marketplace.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.869
These lawsuits have been concentrated

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.539
in specific high-risk industries.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.330
In 2023, 10 industries made up

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.692
over 93% of all web
accessibility lawsuits.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.326
Leading the list
was fashion and retail,

00:16:09.327 --> 00:16:12.263
with over 1,100 cases, nearly 1 in 3.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.909
E-commerce has become the front line

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.429
of digital accessibility litigation.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:22.470
Next, restaurants and food
services hit with 885 lawsuits,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.079
often due to menus
and ordering systems

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.199
incompatible with screen readers.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.109
Health care, home decor,
and fitness also appear frequently,

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.309
industries where accessibility
is critical for equal access.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.899
Despite common assumptions,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.499
small and mid-sized businesses
are most often targeted,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.807
local shops, restaurants,
and clinics that may not realize

00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:46.829
the ADA applies
to their websites and apps.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.299
For many, the first notice

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.819
of non-compliance comes
with a lawsuit,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.449
bringing legal fees, settlements,
and reputational harm.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.279
If you operate in these industries,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.639
especially retail or restaurants,
you're in the spotlight.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.979
Now is the time
to make your site accessible

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.189
before a lawsuit makes
the decision for you.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.609
As if a lawsuit weren't enough,
it can actually get worse.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.919
What many businesses don't realize

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.779
is that the US Department
of Justice can step in.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.759
They're the federal agency
responsible for enforcing the ADA.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.019
When that happens, it's not just
a court order to fix your website.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.559
It becomes a consent decree,
a multi-year agreement

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.892
that goes far beyond basic
WCAG compliance.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.339
These decrees often require
complete website overhauls,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.649
hiring dedicated accessibility staff,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.249
regular audits and reports,
mandatory staff training,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.429
testing by people
with disabilities, and on and on.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.639
Each of these requirements
carry significant cost,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.939
often adding up to hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.659
Once the DOJ steps in,
they set the terms and conditions.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.499
You're required to meet
every demand on their schedule.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.379
When you act proactively,
you stay in control.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.479
You decide the timeline,
the priorities,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.219
and how to build accessibility

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.679
in a way that fits
your business and budget.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.929
The goal isn't to avoid
accessibility.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.987
It's to protect
your business by doing it

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:13.019
on your own terms before someone
else decides for you.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.909
Let's talk about
accessibility widgets,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.799
those little icons
that pop up in the corner

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.579
of a website and promise
to help with ADA compliance.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.289
It sounds convenient, right?

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.889
Who wouldn't want an easy fix
for something this complicated?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.749
But here's what the data shows.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.092
In 2023, nearly one
in four ADA website lawsuits

00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:34.919
were filed against sites
that already had a widget installed.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.469
These businesses
invested in tools marketed

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.754
to improve accessibility,
yet still faced legal action.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.159
The three most frequently
named widget providers

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.559
in those lawsuits were AccessiBe,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.070
appearing in 348 cases,

00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:54.030
UserWay, 246, and AudioEye, 72 cases.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.229
In total, there were
929 lawsuits involving

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.642
sites using accessibility
widgets that year.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.239
If these tools are intended to help,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.709
why are so many sites
using them still being sued?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.519
Because widgets don't fix
underlying accessibility issues.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.349
They don't repair broken code,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.119
label unlabeled buttons,
or ensure proper navigation.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.559
They're applied
as an overlay, sitting on top

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.009
of existing barriers rather
than removing them.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.959
Courts and plaintiff law firms

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.719
are increasingly focusing
on this distinction.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.519
Under WCAG, accessibility must be
built into the website by default,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.339
not added through
user-activated tools.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.189
For example, a link has
to be distinguishable

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.549
from regular text
without relying on color alone.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.869
That's the standard.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.119
That's what compliance requires.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.219
Shifting that burden onto the user,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.589
expecting them to find
a widget, open it,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.619
and toggle on a setting
just to read your content,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.499
that does not align
with WCAG requirements.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.619
In fact, research has found
that widgets can interfere

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.389
with assistive technologies.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.149
In particular, some screen
reader users have reported

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.459
that widgets disrupt navigation,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.569
prevent form submission,
or override custom settings.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.499
A 2024 master's thesis
examining AccessiBe, UserWay,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.749
and AudioEye tested usability

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.329
for participants
with visual impairments.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.699
The study found
no measurable improvement

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.309
in accessibility, and in some cases,

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.709
participants reported
a worse experience

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.349
once they realized
a widget was there.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.669
Even the National Federation

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.979
of the Blind has spoken
out against widgets,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.619
saying they undermine
accessibility standards

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.520
and create barriers for blind users.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.019
Accessibility can't be achieved
through a widget,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.499
and relying on one can actually
increase your risk of a lawsuit.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.779
Legal compliance means
fixing the accessibility

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.199
barriers in your code,
your design, and your content.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.379
That's the only
approach that truly works.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.299
Now let's take this one step further,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.879
because it's not just businesses
facing lawsuits.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.799
Some of the widget
companies themselves

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.779
are now under legal scrutiny.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.099
Take AccessiBe.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.799
Their tool was marketed
as a simple solution.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.609
Just install it and your site
becomes ADA compliant.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.479
When lawsuits continued,
a class-action lawsuit was filed.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.779
In 2024, the Federal Trade
Commission investigated

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.839
and fined them
$1 million over marketing

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.172
practices related to ADA
compliance claims.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.109
Now UserWay is
in a similar situation,

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.289
currently the subject
of a class-action lawsuit alleging

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.559
that its marketing misled
customers into believing

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.959
their widget ensured compliance.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.549
Here's the bigger picture.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.489
So far, no widget
company has demonstrated

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.469
that their product alone can bring

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.279
a site into full compliance
with ADA or WCAG standards.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.889
Because accessibility
can't be layered on,

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.839
it has to be built in, in the code,
in the content, and in the design.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.899
These cases underscore
a critical legal truth.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.109
Compliance cannot be
outsourced to a widget.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.859
Under the ADA and WCAG,
accessibility must be inherent

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.019
to the design and development,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.009
embedded in the site's code,
and verified through testing,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.699
not applied retroactively
through a third-party widget.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.459
Quick fixes may seem convenient,
but they don't satisfy

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.459
legal obligations
or prevent liability.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.069
Accessibility isn't
a feature you add.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.369
It's a legal requirement
and a civil right that demands

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.299
deliberate design, verification,
and accountability.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.889
Now let's look
at one of the most common

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.489
violations cited in lawsuits,
missing alt text.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.919
It's also one of the easiest to fix.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.649
Alt text, short for alternative text,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.409
is what a screen reader
announces to describe an image.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.249
Without it, the image isn't
communicated to the user at all.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.619
That means someone using
a screen reader has no way

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.029
of knowing what's there,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.997
whether it's a product photo,
a chart, or a button.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.449
Here's where many people
get confused.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.012
Not every image needs alt text.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.069
Under WCAG, only images
that convey meaning

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.429
or perform a function require it.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.349
Adding alt text to purely decorative

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.733
images is actually
a violation under WCAG.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.279
The W3C, the organization
behind WCAG,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.059
has an excellent images tutorial
that explains this in detail,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.799
covering every image type you'll find

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.005
on the website and when alt
text is or isn't required.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.872
It also walks through how to write
clear, helpful alt text.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.979
Getting this right matters because
cluttering someone's screen reader

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.359
with unneeded descriptions
makes navigation harder, not easier.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.789
On this slide, you'll see
the alternative text field

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.799
from the WordPress Media Library.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.519
When you upload an image,
you'll also see a link below it.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.159
Learn how to describe
the purpose of the image.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.699
That link takes you straight
to the W3C guide.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.279
Now that we know
e-commerce are the top targets

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.789
for lawsuits, this violation
makes perfect sense.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.029
Every product image
and each variation of it,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.013
needs accurate alt text.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.020
For example, imagine a store
displaying a hat in eight colors,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.769
where the brown and orange
versions are 30% off,

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.679
but that discount only
appears in the image.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:16.075
Without alt text, a blind customer
would never know that sale exists.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.659
That's not just
an accessibility issue.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.279
It's a missed opportunity.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.079
When information like discounts

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.769
or product details
isn't conveyed to all customers,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.029
the business itself takes the hit,
losing potential sales, trust,

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.966
and opening the door to legal action.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.869
Next on this list, and one
that can completely block access,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.099
is keyboard navigation barriers.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.519
Under WCAG, anything a user can do

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.209
with a mouse must also be
possible with a keyboard.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.849
That means being able
to tap through menus,

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.169
open drop-downs, fill out forms,
click buttons, watch videos,

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.659
all without ever touching a mouse.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.209
When this breaks,
it's not just inconvenient,

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.339
it can make your site unusable.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.559
Imagine this on an e-commerce site.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.019
A customer is tapping
through a product page,

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.906
ready to add an item to their cart,
but when they reach

00:25:06.907 --> 00:25:09.809
the Add to Cart button,
it's not focusable,

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.899
or when they open a size
selector for the pants they want,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.679
and they're unable to move
forward or exit out of it.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.069
That's called a keyboard trap,
and it's one of the most damaging

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.679
accessibility violations
you can have.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.779
For users who rely on keyboards,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.789
including people
with motor disabilities,

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.939
blind users with screen readers,
and many others,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.629
if the keyboard doesn't work,
the website doesn't work.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.009
Here's the challenge.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.699
In WordPress, barriers
can come from themes, plugins,

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.429
page builders,
even a marketing pop-up.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.379
You might have an accessible menu,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.709
but a plugin could introduce
WCAG violations.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.989
That's why you have
to test it manually.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.439
Put the mouse aside
and use only your keyboard.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.679
Can you reach every link,
button, and form field?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.269
Can you close a pop-up?

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.979
Can you complete a checkout?

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.249
If you can't, neither can
your customers who depend

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.930
on keyboard access.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.859
In e-commerce, that means
lost sales, frustrated users,

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.699
and potential lawsuits,
because it's not just a code issue,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.689
it's a barrier that stops someone
from buying your product.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.819
Now let's talk about
inaccessible forms.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.089
One of the most common
and most damaging barriers online.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.779
Forms power everything
we do on the web.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.699
They're how customers check out,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.699
subscribe to a newsletter,
create an account, or request help.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.809
In e-commerce,

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.649
a single inaccessible form
can block an entire transaction.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.619
Here's what happens
when accessibility is missing.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.259
If a field has no programmatic label,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.959
screen reader users
don't know what to enter.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.019
If error messages aren't
linked to the correct field,

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.059
they can't tell what needs fixing.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.579
If the form can't be completed
with the keyboard,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.009
many users can't submit it at all.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.869
Accessibility in forms means

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.389
that every input
must have a proper label,

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.484
and placeholders
do not count as labels.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.869
Required fields
must be clearly identified.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.829
Errors must be announced and
associated with the correct field,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.429
describing what's wrong
and what needs to be entered.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.619
The full form, from start to submit,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.079
must be operable
with the keyboard alone.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.919
Because when a form fails,
it's not just a technical issue.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.829
It's a lost opportunity,
a blocked purchase,

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.009
a missed sign-up,
or a denied application.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.919
Under the ADA and WCAG,
these aren't just usability bugs,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.699
they're barriers
to equal participation.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.759
Test every form on your site,
whether it's a checkout page

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.999
or a one-field newsletter
sign-up, ask yourself,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.219
can it be completed without a mouse?

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.379
Can every user
understand what's required

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.419
and fix errors independently?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.499
If not, the form isn't just broken,
it's excluding some people,

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.489
and that's just the kind of violation
that lands in lawsuits.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.559
Next up is inaccessible videos,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.499
and this one carries major weight,
because video is one

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.829
of the most powerful tools
businesses use to communicate,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.475
to sell, to inspire, to connect.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.609
When accessibility is missing,
it becomes one of the most common

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.369
and costly barriers
cited in lawsuits.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.099
The first issue is missing captions.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.749
When captions are absent, deaf
and hard-of-hearing users lose access

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.559
to the spoken message,
the dialogue, the instructions,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.529
maybe even the emotion
that drives engagement.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:30.089
Captions aren't optional,
they're required for equal access.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.209
The second barrier
is no text descriptions.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.429
Think about short product clips,

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.369
a model turning
to show how a jacket fits,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.949
a demo showing how software looks,

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.429
a close-up of fabric texture,
any kind of video

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.397
where there's no sound,
no narration, just visuals,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.671
these need a text description,
because without it,

00:28:51.672 --> 00:28:55.469
blind users are excluded from
the information that's being shown.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.629
In lawsuits, these
videos are often cited

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.929
because they deny equal
access to product details

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.639
and brand storytelling,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.449
key information that cited
users receive instantly.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.859
The fix is simple.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.889
Add captions to every video
with spoken content.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.829
Add text descriptions
to videos without narration,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.400
so visuals are equally
conveyed through words.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.169
Every clip tells a story.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.499
You just want to make sure
everyone can get it.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.019
Let's look at one more,
low color contrast.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.299
This one doesn't just
affect people with low vision,

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.739
it affects everyone.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.819
Think about when you've seen light
gray text on a white background.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.489
That can be really hard to see
for some users.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.859
I was just editing a video recently,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.349
and the control bar
at the bottom was so faint,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.939
it was almost invisible.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.272
That lack of contrast
made the task harder.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.409
On a website, that same
issue can become a barrier.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.629
When the text blends
into the background,

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.789
people can't easily
read your content,

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.729
navigate your menus,
or use your forms.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.889
When that happens, users leave,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.779
or if they can't leave
because they need

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.899
to complete something,
it becomes a source of frustration.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.649
You can absolutely design
something beautiful and on-brand.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.539
You just need to ensure
your colors meet

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.634
the contrast ratios
that WCAG specifies.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.899
Often, it's as simple
as adjusting a hex code slightly

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.769
to stay compliant while keeping
your look consistent.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.339
Remember, low color
contrast isn't just a design flaw.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.389
It's one of the most common issues
cited in accessibility lawsuits.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.839
These five examples
represent only a small portion

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.769
of the violations repeatedly
cited in accessibility litigation.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.979
Each constitutes a barrier
that excludes users

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.369
and creates measurable
legal exposure for businesses.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.699
Addressing accessibility
is not merely a best practice,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.279
it's a legal obligation
and a critical safeguard

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.930
for compliance, usability,
and brand integrity.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.739
We've covered the law, the lawsuits,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.509
and the most common violations.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.639
Now it's time
to bring it all together.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.169
Here's what you can do.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.029
Test your website thoroughly.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.059
You can't fix what you
haven't identified.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.879
Automated scans are a helpful start,
but they only catch

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.039
a fraction of accessibility barriers.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.719
The issues that trigger lawsuits

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.269
are often the ones those tools miss.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.719
Combine automated checks
with manual testing to uncover

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.290
the full picture,
then remediate those issues.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.329
Involve disabled users.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.139
Hire people with disabilities
to test your site.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.499
Screen reader users, keyboard-only
users, low-vision users.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.099
Their feedback provides authentic,
real-world insights

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.067
that mirror the experiences
documented in lawsuits.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.209
There are helpful tools
you can use in WordPress,

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.499
like Joel Dolson's
Accessibility Plugin

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.039
and Equalize Digital's
Accessibility Checker.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.249
These can help you identify
and address barriers.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.555
Finally, follow
the recognized legal standard.

00:31:50.556 --> 00:31:55.900
WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the technical
standard currently in the ADA.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.019
Now what you can't do.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.629
You can't assume
your website is accessible

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.149
just because your theme claims it is.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.019
Even accessibility-ready WordPress
themes still require testing,

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.119
and page builders can override
that code, introducing new barriers.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.479
You can't treat accessibility
as a one-time project.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.049
Every update to WordPress core,
page builders, themes,

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.769
or plugins can introduce
new accessibility barriers.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.259
That's why ongoing testing is vital.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.769
In fact, DOJ settlement
agreements often require

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.699
businesses to test
their websites every six months.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.409
You can't rely on widgets.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.509
They don't bring
your site into compliance

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.909
and often create additional barriers.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.649
Compliance isn't static.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.903
It's maintained
through consistent action.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.829
After everything we've covered,
the lawsuits, the rulings,

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.789
the violations, the big question is,
where is this all heading?

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:55.079
In April 2024, the Department
of Justice updated the ADA,

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.939
requiring all public entities

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.549
to make their websites
and apps accessible.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.041
That's now a clear deadline
and no gray area.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.429
But private businesses
are still navigating

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.799
a maze of lawsuits and unclear rules.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.509
That might soon change.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:15.435
In May 2025, a bipartisan group
in Congress introduced H.R. 3417,

00:33:15.477 --> 00:33:18.879
the Websites and Software
Applications Accessibility Act.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.359
It's still in committee,
but if it passes,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.139
it will rewrite the rules
for every business in America.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.649
This bill would cover
public-facing websites and apps,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.377
including online-only businesses.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.239
It would close legal loopholes

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.669
that have fueled
confusion and litigation.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.719
It would establish clear nationwide
standards aligned with WCAG.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.449
And it would require
updates every three years

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.149
so the law keeps
pace with technology.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.939
For the first time,
enforcement would be unified,

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.979
shared between
the Department of Justice

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.619
and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission,

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.029
giving businesses a clear roadmap
and a standard to follow.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.709
More than a regulatory shift,
this marks a civil rights milestone.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.169
Once this law passes,
digital accessibility

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.239
won't just be best practice.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.059
It will be recognized
for what it truly is,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.149
a right to information,
a right to participation,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.439
a right to access, and that's
where the future is headed.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.839
While Congress continues
to debate federal standards,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.809
some states have begun
taking action on their own,

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.779
targeting patterns of abusive
website accessibility litigation

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.259
that overwhelm small
businesses with repetitive lawsuits.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.830
In 2023, Kansas became
the first state to pass

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.699
the Act Against Abusive
Website Access Litigation.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.859
This law allows Kansas businesses

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.709
or the Attorney General
to sue the plaintiff

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.339
or attorney when lawsuits
are deemed predatory.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.099
Other states are now
following Kansas' lead.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.740
In 2025, Illinois introduced

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.889
the Stop Abusive
Website Access Litigation Act,

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.019
granting the Attorney
General authority

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.839
to bring civil actions
against parties or firms

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.309
that repeatedly file meritless
website accessibility claims.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.879
These laws, however,
do not block legitimate cases.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.589
They preserve
the right of individuals

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.989
with disabilities
to pursue valid claims,

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.659
but they aim to curb
bad-faith filings

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.689
that do little
to advance accessibility.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.489
Together, these state
measures reflect

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.639
a growing call for balance,
ensuring access remains

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.139
a civil right while protecting
businesses from abuse of process.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.169
As more states act,
the pressure builds for a clear,

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.829
unified federal standard, precisely
what the Websites and Software

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.718
Applications Accessibility
Act seeks to establish.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.789
After all the lawsuits, laws,
loopholes, and lessons,

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.021
it comes down to one thing.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.739
Make your website and app accessible,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.299
not out of fear of litigation,
not as a checkbox for compliance,

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.879
but because people
depend on what you offer,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.469
and too many can't reach it if
your site isn't accessible to them.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.859
Your digital presence
is the front door to your business.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.249
If it's closed to some,
it's closed to too many.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.699
Accessibility is the key
that opens that door.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.239
Test thoroughly, remove barriers,
and design with empathy,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.549
because accessibility is ongoing,

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.159
a continual commitment
to ensuring everyone

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.349
can engage with what you've built.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.396
This is how we move
from lawsuits to lasting impact.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.049
Thank you for spending
this time with me.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.419
Accessibility is something
I care deeply about,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.509
and I'm grateful for the chance
to share why it matters.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.899
My hope is that today helped
you see accessibility differently,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.149
not as a checklist, but as a bridge,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.329
a bridge that connects
people to what you've built.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.129
If you'd like to continue
the conversation,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.989
whether it's exploring your own site,

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.209
building a roadmap,
or simply learning more,

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.529
I'd love to hear from you.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.009
You can reach me at POURPIS.com
or connect with me on LinkedIn.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.789
Together we can create a web
that truly welcomes everyone.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.790
Thank you.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.279
Madeline: Yes, thank you very much,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.210
Vanessa Tillemans,
for that presentation.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.799
This is also to remind everyone
that the Q&A section is live,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.109
so you can place
in all your questions,

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.507
and Vanessa will answer them.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.824
Let me go to the Q&A section

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.110
to see some questions
that we can roll up.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:20.999
Okay.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.939
Vanessa, can you hear me?

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.683
Vanessa: Yes,
I can hear you, perfect.

00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:26.271
Madeline: Great.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:32.358
Bet Hannon is asking
that does H.R. 3417

00:37:32.359 --> 00:37:34.739
still allow for citizens to sue,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.676
or is all enforcement to move to DOJ?

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.229
Vanessa: That's a good question.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.319
The current draft does
include a private right of action,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.299
allowing individuals to sue,

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.584
rather than shifting
all of the enforcement to the DOJ.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.199
Madeline: All right, great.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.449
Well, this is an anonymous attendee,

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.769
and he or she is asking that,
with the current administration,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.589
do you foresee
less enforcement of the ADA,

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.223
or do you have any fear
that the current DOJ

00:38:04.224 --> 00:38:07.859
might use it as a tool to put
more burden on some sites,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.389
more than others,
depending on their judgment?

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.379
Vanessa: Yes, that's a good question.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.289
There have been some changes
in the current administration

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.226
that have affected web accessibility.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.829
I don't know what's going to happen,
per se, with that.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.619
Less enforcement of the ADA,
I don't think so,

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.339
because of the fact
that Congress has introduced

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.545
this bipartisan bill,
and people are talking about it.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.599
Congress is addressing
this issue, first of all.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.419
Secondly, the DOJ does
have that deadline,

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.299
so I don't see any less
enforcement happening,

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.299
but I do think that
the current administration

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.009
could be addressing some things

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.069
that perhaps aren't
being addressed yet.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.809
That's what I think for now.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.529
What was the other part?

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.249
Let's see.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:01.248
The DOJ might use it as a tool
to put more burden on some sites.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.236
No, I don't think so.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.349
I think what it comes
down to is really, like,

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.339
what is the lawsuit saying,
and what's the lawsuit saying

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.249
about what the harm
was to the plaintiff,

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.039
and what is the DOJ going to do
to get involved with that,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.729
if they decide to get
involved in that settlement.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:28.409
For some cases, they do get involved,
and for others, they don't.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.839
They have to have the staff
to be able to do that, too,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.229
and so, as long as they've got
enough bandwidth

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.429
to handle those kinds of things,

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:40.666
and I most certainly think they will,
especially with the deadline.

00:39:40.737 --> 00:39:41.403
Madeline: All right.

00:39:41.404 --> 00:39:43.109
Another question goes,

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:46.479
do accessibility laws
impact your digital presence

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.796
on social media graphics, blasted
emails, or is it just the website?

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.389
Vanessa: That's
a really good question.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:58.889
Social media accessibility
is a thing for public entities,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.929
so government institutions

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.319
and the like are supposed
to start be working on that,

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.945
and there is a deadline for them.

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:11.849
Social media graphics, for sure,
are going to have to be accessible,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:14.429
but there are exceptions to that.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.079
I did a blog, or not a blog post,

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.179
a LinkedIn post a little
while ago about that,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.739
what the exceptions are,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.909
like if it's talking about
a city-wide something

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.472
or other that happened in 2023,

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.189
the city's not going
to be required to go back

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.126
and put alt text
on an image that old.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.459
There will be exceptions in there,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:40.380
and there is a link from the DOJ
with those exceptions.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.009
I can look it up and send
it to you guys afterwards

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.739
if you want, but there
is a link for that.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.449
Madeline: Sure, thank you.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:53.459
Anita Larson is asking,
does any legal responsibility fall

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.499
on the web developers themselves,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.705
or is it the responsibility
of the entity or business?

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.609
Vanessa: That's
a really good question.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.470
The answer is it can.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.074
When a lawsuit is filed,
it's the business that's sued,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.969
but the business can then turn

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.749
around and sue the web developer,
or the web agency.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.469
For sure, if a web agency
gets sued by their client,

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.209
that is an absolute
thing that can happen,

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.539
and they can accuse the agency
of not having informed them

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.929
or told them that this was a thing
that they needed to do.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.939
When the lawsuit is filed
against the business,

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.619
it's the business that's sued,

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.839
but then the business
can turn around and sue

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.569
the web developer
or the agency that they hired.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.779
Madeline: Okay.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.819
This is anonymous is asking.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.299
If you show you are making
your websites accessible,

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.039
but you're not fully accessible,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.279
still working on it,
can they still sue you?

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.049
Sometime, it takes time in making
it accessible, someone's asking.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.059
Vanessa: That's
a really good question.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.579
One of the things that I didn't
mention in the presentation,

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.099
which is super important
that everyone do,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.009
is have an accessibility
statement on your website,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.529
because that gives people
the ability to reach out

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.739
to you and contact
you if they run into a problem.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.054
In fact, when Nike was sued,

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.899
that actually was mentioned
in the lawsuit.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.239
The fact that there was not
an accessibility statement

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.140
on their website was in the lawsuit.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:24.399
The reason that was in there
is because that is the way

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.269
that someone can reach
out to you if they need help.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.219
Yes, have an accessibility statement

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.699
that says we're working on it.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.549
We're working on it.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.719
We're doing the things.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.410
Have a way for them to reach you,

00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:39.061
either by phone or email
or whatever, but then,

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.659
do be showing like active work.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.369
If six months passes,

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:48.337
and it's still in the same
it was six months prior,

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.449
that might not look so good.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.029
If a year passes, that's too long.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.009
You do want to be working especially

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.977
on what I would say
are like the high-priority things

00:42:59.978 --> 00:43:02.209
that get cited in lawsuits.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.309
Your critical user
flows on your website,

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.459
any place where a user
can get to a form,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.579
they can make a purchase,
they can sign up for something,

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.219
those are high-priority user flows.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.479
You're going to want to check
all those, test them, and fix them.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.359
Focus on the high-priority things
that are mentioned in lawsuits

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.859
and then keep working from there.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.579
Absolutely, you can show
that you're working

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.499
on it by your
accessibility statement.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.029
If you do not have
one on your website,

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.559
just put it up there today.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.799
It's probably the best thing
you can do legal wise.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.669
Madeline: Okay.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.969
The last one, it was already
answered in the chat box,

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.175
but I would want to read
it out so everybody hears it.

00:43:43.229 --> 00:43:47.369
Tacko asks, on TaylorSwift.com,
there's fine print text

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.639
at the bottom of each page
telling screen reader users

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.909
to call a number if they run
into problems with the website.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.029
Is this sufficient
to comply with the ADA,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.639
or should they really
make websites accessible?

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.669
Vanessa: Yes, that's
a really good question too.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.796
No, that does not make a site
compliant with the ADA.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.999
The ADA now has been updated,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.449
and it says that a site
has to comply with WCAG.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.369
To comply with WCAG
does not mean you put up

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.789
a statement saying call
us if you have a problem.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.599
Under the ADA, businesses
must provide people

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.439
with disabilities equal
access to the goods, services,

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.209
and information they offer online.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.639
Equal access means being
able to use the website

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.119
independently without having
to call a number for help.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.899
Absolutely have it in your
accessibility statement for sure.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.549
If you want to have a phone
number on there,

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.519
but at the very minimum have
an email address in there,

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.852
but that does not make
a website compliant.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.759
Hopefully, Taylor Swift's working
on that if she's not already,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.713
her and her team,
getting that site fixed,

00:44:51.714 --> 00:44:54.960
because they unfortunately
are a target.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.309
Beyonce was sued, so celebrities
do get sued over this.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.798
They have been.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.089
Jeffree Star websites was sued.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:03.934
Who else?

00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:05.422
Kim Kardashian.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.139
Celebrities are a target,

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.949
so they really should
absolutely be doing things

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.429
to fix their website for sure.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.444
Madeline: Okay.

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.488
Thank you very much, Vanessa-

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:17.656
Vanessa: Yes, you're welcome.

00:45:17.657 --> 00:45:20.839
Madeline: -for such
an insightful conversation.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.284
Appreciate it.

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:21.785
Vanessa: Yes, you're welcome.

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:22.619
Thank you guys for coming.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.639
I'm so glad you're here.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.480
Sorry for the technical issues,
and I'm glad you stuck around.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.869
Madeline: Thank you
for attending this session

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.129
with Vanessa Tillemans.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.299
