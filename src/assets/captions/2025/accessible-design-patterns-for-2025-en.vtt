Jessica Sams: Well, welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.819
My name is Jessica Sams,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.279
and I'm a Virtual Public
Engagement Specialist

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.750
and UX Designer from SWCA
Environmental Consultants.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.319
Thank you for joining us
for Accessible Design Patterns

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
for 2025 with Vitaly Friedman.

00:01:56.688 --> 00:02:01.199
Vitaly loves beautiful content
and does not give up easily.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.900
He was born in Minsk, Belarus,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.309
and he studied computer science
and mathematics in Germany.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.589
While writing algebra
proofs, and preparing

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.079
for software engineering
at night in the kitchen,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.829
he simultaneously discovered
a passion for typography,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.309
interface design, and writing.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.839
After working as a freelance designer

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.017
and developer for six years, in 2006,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.025
he co-founded Smashing Magazine,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.549
a leading online magazine
for designers and developers.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.189
Through the years,
his curiosity guided him

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.589
from interface design, to front-end,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.799
to performance optimization,
to accessibility,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.320
and back to user experience.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:49.049
Vitaly is the author, co-author,
and editor of Smashing Books,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.050
and a curator
of Smashing Conferences.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.689
He is the UX lead with the European
Parliament and Smashing Magazine,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.859
and he's a front-end/UX
consultant in Europe and abroad,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.169
working with large
and small companies,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.168
and organizations like Haufe-Lexware,
Axel-Springer, and others.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.951
He also runs Measure UX
and Smart Interface Design Patterns,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.519
friendly video courses
on UX and design patterns,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.419
along with a live UX training

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.280
for passionate UX
and product designers.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.219
In this session,
Vitaly will take a deep dive

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.379
into UX and design guidelines,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.109
hundreds of real-life
examples, best practices,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.359
and guidelines for truly accessible,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.730
inclusive, universal design.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.819
Expect to leave
with a toolbox of insights,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.628
and practical techniques
to apply to any project.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.319
You may add your questions
using Zoom's Q&A button anytime,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.809
and we will answer them
at the end of the presentation.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.856
Use the Chat button
to connect with other attendees.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.779
Vitaly Friedman: Hello, dear friends,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.739
and what a pleasure it is to be
a part of this wonderful community,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.879
and to speak at a wonderful
conference as well.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.019
Sending a lot of greetings to you,
so I'm looking forward to this.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.589
Now, thinking about accessibility,

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.449
and thinking about inclusive design,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.679
I'm actually really impressed

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.659
by what we as a community
made over the last 20, 25 years.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.859
We've been spending a lot of time,
and you find enormous

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.349
amount of articles
and tools and techniques,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.779
and all around accessibility, yet,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.609
still it feels
like it's very difficult

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.649
to make a strong
case for accessibility.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.869
It's very difficult
to integrate accessibility.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.059
Somehow, it's just challenging.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.619
I want to share some of the insights

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.199
and some of the things
that I wish I'd known earlier,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.079
and things that are maybe
little tweaks and little changes,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.559
but they can have a tremendous impact
on people who need it the most.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.289
That's exactly what this
little session is all about.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.179
Accessible design patterns
that I wish I'd known earlier.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.509
Now, specifically,
when I think about accessibility,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.319
I think about a way
of how we usually perceive it.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.339
Now, typically,
I think there is still a lot

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.819
of accessibility checklists,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.257
a lot of accessibility compliance
guides, and things like that.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.828
I have a problem with that.

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:03.059
The problem is that, very often,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.832
when I even start speaking about
accessibility, it's often perceived

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:09.086
as a compliance check,
compliance mandate.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.899
What you find is a lot
of companies just do enough

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.359
to meet the accessibility guidelines,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.089
to be complying in terms
of European Accessibility Act,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.817
and this is also where they stop.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.179
It's really rarely that it actually
has an established--

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.849
Companies actually have
an established accessibility practice,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.909
accessibility research,
or anything related to that.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.369
It's actually almost something
that you have to fight for,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.769
have to argue for every single time.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.019
It's very often,
at least in my world,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.499
where I realize that companies
do just enough to then stop,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.969
to then do a big comprehensive
audit maybe a year later,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.239
and this goes in these fast
sprints that then end,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.769
and then there is silence,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.899
but accessibility
doesn't work like this.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.729
I think it's really worth
noting at this point

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.259
that accessibility
should not be perceived

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.249
as a compliance checklist.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.919
I think that I'm speaking
to the audience

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.409
that actually knows
it anyway at this point.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.539
It's something that
I always try to emphasize

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.179
in every single meeting,
in every single conversation,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.019
in every single gathering that
I have around accessibility as well.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.489
It's an effort.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.429
Accessibility doesn't
happen by accident.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.929
It happens intentionally.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.029
It must be designed,
it must be shaped,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.539
it must be placed forward
in a way in an organization

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.299
that maybe has reluctance,
or hesitance to do that.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.859
Very often, just because
it doesn't understand

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.419
what accessibility even means,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.379
or doesn't understand
how accessibility relates to it,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.279
so we need to keep that in mind.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.659
Accessibility is an effort.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.629
It's a dedicated effort
to keep a digital experience

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.689
meaningful and usable
for as many people as possible.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.539
This is how I perceive it.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.219
We often speak
about inclusive design,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.999
we often speak about accessibility.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.199
To me, it's just making sure

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.409
that whatever it is we're creating,
can and will be used

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.629
by people who want or need to use it.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.189
This is all it is.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.299
I'm also a little bit allergic

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.699
to this notion of edge
cases or average users.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.329
I find that this is just
the wrong perception to look at it.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.719
There is no general user,
there are no average users,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.401
there is no high impact user profile,
or anything like that.

00:07:08.693 --> 00:07:09.899
It's just different people

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.660
have different abilities
and disabilities, right?

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.449
It's all on a range,
it's all on the spectrum somewhere,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.679
so we need to keep in mind
that there are no edge cases.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.729
No, people are not edge cases,
they're people.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.059
People are not average users
either, they are people,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.849
and we need to respect and appreciate
that, and design for it.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.419
For me, it's not even
about checklists,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.899
it's about retaining
accessibility from the start.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.859
It's obviously much
cheaper if you do this early.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.739
As Scott Jehl said many years ago,
accessibility is not something

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.439
that we add to the website
when we're done.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.419
It's something that we
start with initially,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.329
and then risk losing
with every single change.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.019
Our task is to retain
it throughout the design process.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.279
Now, how would you do that,
you might ask,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.319
and that is a very good question.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.729
I would say that we will go in,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.519
and we just apply the dimension
at which we are working

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.399
to the context of a kind
of inclusive design

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.039
as we know it, for example,
from Microsoft Design Toolkit.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.279
In Microsoft Design Toolkit,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.279
we break down the entire
accessible experience,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.679
or inclusive experience
across five senses.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.699
Touching, seeing, hearing,
speaking and thinking.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.259
Across them we actually
have different dimensions.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.819
On the one hand we have
permanent disabilities,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.489
temporary disabilities,
and situational disabilities,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.359
but we also might have a domain
that actually applies directly to us.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.979
Here we have touch, and of course,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.419
you might have a one arm,
that says permanent disability.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.499
We might have an arm injury,
so it's temporary,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.794
or you're a new parent, and you're
holding a baby in your hand,

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:39.089
and it's situational,
or you might be traveling,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.569
and so as touch applies to you,
it maybe inaccessible flights.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.819
Maybe there is an elevator
you cannot touch

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.169
a button on or anything similar.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.199
On the other hand, in seeing
it would be distracted driver,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.539
in hearing it would be noisy
train station,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.119
in speaking, it could be new country
in different language,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.549
and thinking could be stressed
over cancelled flight,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.669
or just in a situation
where you have to run to the train,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.659
the train is delayed and all of that,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.202
and you can't really make reasonable
or rational decisions.

00:09:04.203 --> 00:09:05.499
You have to really--

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.736
Your cognitive ability to think
is severely limited or constrained.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.769
This already makes
accessibility more relatable

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.839
to the product
in which you're working.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.259
Also, this is coming from
the Ministry of Justice in the UK,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.599
and the same story
just applied to court.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.119
Touching, carrying paperwork,
dark courtroom,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.789
as of seeing it,
and a few things like that.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.859
In fact, Gov.uk ended up creating

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.034
a dedicated set
of accessibility personas

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.169
that highlight what people
are going through,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.679
as they're actually experiencing
different types of disabilities.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.619
Some people would say that this is
unnecessary and we need to flag in,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.289
instead of creating
new accessibility personas,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.139
we need to just extend
existing personas if we have them

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.779
with some specific
needs that they have.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.979
I'm okay with either way.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.719
I don't think that we need
to fight about this.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.159
This is not about that.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.379
What we should be probably
be aligned about,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.899
is that disability
is not a personal health condition,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.869
but it's a mismatched
human interaction.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.449
It's important because whenever
we're speaking about disability,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.479
it almost has a wrong connotation
to a lot of people.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.819
It feels like it doesn't
really apply to them.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.994
It applies to other
people, but not them.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.009
That's a bit weird,
because whenever we're looking

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.419
at any kind of invention that's been

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.419
around for many years,
chances are high

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.649
that it actually came
from the accessibility world.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.648
Be it subtitles, be it SMS,
be it eyeglasses that we're wearing.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.119
All of them are
accessibility devices,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.999
and accessibility features
that we rely on every single day.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.397
People just don't realize it.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.679
Maybe people just don't notice it,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.579
so I always try to make it
more visible, so to say.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.559
Now, that's just the background
of how I come to this,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.329
and how I perceive inclusive
design accessibility then as well.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.900
For me, it's also all
around one single thing.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.219
The whole world of accessibility
is for me about preventing blockers

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.639
for people who need it the most,
but also for everybody around.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.829
Because accessibility
is better for everyone.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.819
There is no dedicated
accessibility effort

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.919
that will not have a side benefits

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.499
which basically relate
to everybody in the room.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.969
That's really important
to keep in mind.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.279
Of course, when you
think about blockers,

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.229
we often think about
the usual suspects.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.359
One of them is color blindness.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.292
Of course, color blindness
affects a lot of people.

00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:21.539
300 million people have some kind
of color weakness or colorblind.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.499
Sometimes you will find

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.539
a lot of organizations
going a little bit further,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.549
and adding some textures and shapes.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.859
Sometimes having
something like a shape toggle.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.668
You can toggle on and off
the shades, the shapes,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.820
so people can actually
understand those spark lines

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.239
in the chart,
or in dashboards better.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.249
A nice example of this
is, by the way,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.509
wonderful work done
by Nick Desbarats on dashboard.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.799
In the dashboard,
very often it's very difficult

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.679
to tell apart what has happened and,
what requires attention,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.439
but you can do this with this dot
voting, or votes or dots.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.439
You also need a colorblind
version for that.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.729
Now, we have,
let's say, stock market,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.709
you need to do the same
thing as well.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.569
Probably, green will
be replaced by blue.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.659
You probably might want
to support also a different mode,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.669
for example, the dark mode as well.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.929
Which I think would be very critical

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.492
to actually cover here as well.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.599
That's another option
of what we could do here.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.569
When we look at the examples
of what companies are doing,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.789
very often you will find
something like this.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.219
This is coming from
the carbon design system.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.409
When we're adding
different shapes over here,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.709
and maybe adding shapes
on the lines and line charts.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.229
Also, we actually introduced
some outlines specifically

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.372
for different types,
or parts of the chart.

00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:34.440
You can go quite far,
and in a lot of detail.

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.939
What you also find very often
is that there is some sort

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.159
of a separate view, like maybe this.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.509
Maybe you could view a particular set
of data as a data table,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.839
or as a list, or as a summary
or anything of that kind.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.359
One of the wonderful examples
that I found a while back is coming

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.919
from the Visa product design
system which was released recently.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.919
What I really like about this,
is a close attention to accessibility

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.559
that the team went
into to make it work.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.199
Not only do they have a lot
of data visualization principles

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.539
and guidelines, accessibility
guidelines as well,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.079
and also tools for how to select
the chart and so on.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.729
What I find quite important

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.509
and quite remarkable
is not only the presence,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.599
the visual representation of it,
but actually the level of detail

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.889
that went into designing,

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.859
and defining accessibility
guidelines for each.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.789
Pretty much every single
chart is accessible,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.712
and can be explored via a keyboard.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.756
We'll look into something
like this here.

00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:32.639
Where do cardholders
spend more per interaction?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.899
What we'll find is that, of course,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.359
we have keyboard
navigation instructions here.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.819
You can enter and drill
up a level on a bar group.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.919
You can exit and navigate
with a keyboard.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.189
Then, of course, you can actually
go and dismiss it all together.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.499
Also, what you have here
is a different view.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.814
Like a list view through it.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.299
You can go ahead and say,
"Okay, I'm interested in this."

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.869
I can go further and use keyboard

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.619
to navigate between
the different options right here.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.759
That's actually really interesting

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.369
to see this sort
of interactions happening.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.989
That's a really nice way of having--

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.717
Where we actually could be going.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.329
In general, I think,
what I always keep in mind

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.369
is that whenever we're dealing
with colorblindness,

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.559
we know that blue
is the safest hue for users

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.599
to perceive colors as we do.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.729
You can use any two colors
as long as they vary

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.683
significantly by lightness.

00:14:19.684 --> 00:14:22.049
Colorblind users might tell
red and green apart,

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.943
but not necessarily which is which.

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:28.896
Colorblind's safest palette is
the mix of blue with orange and red.

00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:31.139
We should forget
about pastel colors only.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.599
We should forget about mixing red,
green, and brown.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.309
Mixing pink, turquoise, and gray.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.319
Mixing purple and blue.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.769
We discovered this before.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.049
Green and pink,
if we use red and blue.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.879
Also, not mixing green
with orange, red,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.899
or blue of the same lightness.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.743
Again, the same lightness
is usually going to be a problem.

00:14:45.744 --> 00:14:47.489
If you're interested more in this,

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.719
there is a wonderful
session coming right

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.329
after this about colorblindness
which I highly encourage

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.199
you to actually explore as well.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.349
A couple of resources
I really found useful

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.599
for colorblindness is whocanuse.com

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.969
which takes a color palette,
and then explains to you,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.949
highlights to you
how different people

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.869
with different types of disabilities

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.044
or color perception
will actually see it.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.539
On the other hand,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.159
there is also accessible
color palettes by Venngage,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.229
and also accessible color
palettes on Figma Community,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.990
which I highly encourage
you to explore.

00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.719
If you're into data visualization,
there is a whole Viz Palette tool

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.972
by Elijah Meeks and Susie Lu,
which is also a wonderful tool.

00:15:22.973 --> 00:15:24.299
If you want to learn more

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.499
there is an incredible
series on colorblindness

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.389
and color weakness
as well by Lisa Charlotte Muth,

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.704
so that's also very helpful.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.199
That's colorblindness,

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.469
and we usually speak about it a lot,
but there is more.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.779
One great example is motion sickness.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.669
Now, motion sickness
is when we experience

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.459
a sensory conflict
between what we perceive,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.062
and what we feel, and it often
causes this motion sickness.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.779
Around 30% of people
are susceptible to it,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.199
and this shows in vestibular
disorder or migraines,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.679
and that's usually the case
when we have a mismatch,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.789
a mental mismatch
between what we're experiencing

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.239
and what is actually happening,
or supposed to happen, sorry.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.579
This is just one
of the many websites.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.419
Good luck.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.832
How would you actually
navigate this slider?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.429
You can click on the dot,
you can try to click on the numbers,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.969
you can click somewhere
in the vertical line, but no,

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.419
none of it would work.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.459
No.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.800
All of it is a wrong choice.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.789
In fact, what's expected
here is that you actually swipe.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.279
Now, whenever you have
this sort of mismatch

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.559
of expectations
between you're supposed

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.919
to be navigating vertically,
but it happens horizontally,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.049
that usually is the cause of trouble.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.025
This is an example
from the Van Gogh Museum,

00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:40.159
and we have a similar story.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.609
You scroll down, but actually,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.942
you're scrolling
on the right horizontally.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.889
Now for some people that's okay,

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.359
that's not a big deal,
but for some people

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.999
it could be extremely frustrating
and very annoying.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.189
If we wanted to fix it,
it doesn't mean

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.309
that we need to drop away
all the fantastic examples

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.850
and visual effects
for the sake of being as plain,

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.239
as boring as we possibly can.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.399
No, that's not about that at all.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.293
What you can do is fix the position

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.069
of the object that you want
to tell a story about,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.639
and then as a user is scrolling,
naturally scrolling,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.439
you can actually unfold that story,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.649
and explain and highlight
what exactly has happened here.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.539
This is just one example
of what we could do.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.239
We keep our project fixed,
and then we tell the story,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.359
or as a user you keep scrolling,
you can show more or less,

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.639
you can maybe collapse some areas,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.399
you might even have a timeline
or something similar.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.909
That also is natural,
you just go from top to bottom.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.629
Also, on iOS, maybe I think
it was maybe like two years ago now,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.219
there was a new update
that was released

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.109
which I highly encourage
you to turn on if you feel

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.279
like you might be susceptible
to motion sickness,

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.059
and that's a really good feature
to have in general.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.639
Because the point is,
if you are in the back of a car,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.346
and you're typing to somebody,
to a friend or so, and you need to--

00:17:51.347 --> 00:17:53.879
The car is turning
suddenly left or right,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.429
or accelerates or brakes,
or anything similar,

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.129
that usually creates
this mental mismatch.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.769
If we can indicate to people
of what is happening

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.349
while they are reading
in one direction or the other,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.319
that's actually what really helps
with motion sickness.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.289
In general though, when you think
about accessible motion,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.439
very often people think
that accessible motion is no motion.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.819
That's not necessarily true.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.209
You don't have to remove
and delete all the motion

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.860
to respect the reduced
motion setting by users.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.222
Instead, it could
be just more subtle.

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:26.519
It could be maybe
not include that many steps,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.119
maybe not include that many looping
animations or anything like that.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.689
It doesn't mean just
removing animation altogether.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.879
The safest bet is to respect physics,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.149
map the scrolling to animations,
so that means the scrolling behavior

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.769
that users are having
should be mapped

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.839
to the animation, and how that works.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.039
Any kind of flashing images,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.239
especially when people are reading,
are very disturbing.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.999
Whenever you have some
interactive features,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.039
like maybe, God forbid,
parallax or anything similar,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.949
we probably want to ask for consent,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.659
or at least give people a way
to control it in some way,

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.819
to maybe skip it.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.199
Maybe it could be individual elements

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.789
of a story that people could control,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.529
and skip over if they wanted to,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.659
and just jump to the end
or something similar.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.459
Similar how we have skip the content,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.159
we might also have
skipped to the end.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.629
Then, when you have
this animated charts,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.339
it could also be very helpful.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.919
Then, if you can, please do
avoid parallax scrolling,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.289
because most of the time,
movements at different speeds

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.809
are very frustrating
and very annoying.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.979
Now, with this in mind,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.039
I think it's worth noting
that very often we feel

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.129
like we are in control
of our destiny.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.469
What I mean by that is,
maybe we're young,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.939
maybe we're powerful,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.409
maybe we believe we can do whatever
we want with the world.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.149
Now, we need to keep in mind

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.599
that there are changes
that occur in our life,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.669
and in our vision, in our hearing,

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.029
in our movements,
in our behavior as we grow older.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.039
That goes for different areas.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.839
This is a wonderful
overview by Elizabeth Buie,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.899
who's actually really
brought it all together.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.879
Our senses change,
our movements change,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.049
our cognition changes,
our attitude changes as well.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.369
These changes are not something

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.499
that comes just at a particular age.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.279
It can come at any time,
it can develop at different speeds,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.499
it can reach different
levels of severity,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.769
and occurs in some, or even most
people, but not in everyone.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.450
You just don't know.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.539
An impairment can appear
sooner or later, or never.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.579
For example, in my case,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.699
it was when I was 32 and now 40,
and when I was 32,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.109
I was in a big Prodigy
concert and it was very loud,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.479
and I didn't have any
hearing protection.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.299
Next day, I realized
that I actually have

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.359
a problem with the left ear,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.779
so I could not hear as much
as I could the night before,

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.680
so this just happened when I was 32.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.399
That can happen at any time.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.459
We just need to be very careful,
and very thoughtful about that.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.259
What does that mean?

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.879
When we're looking at these changes
that are unpredictable,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.279
we need to design to support people

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.429
in whatever situation
they might find themselves.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:51.059
This goes from the basics, all
the way to more complicated things.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.709
Let's start with the basics first.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.099
There is nothing more basic
than a mega drop-down.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.319
This mega drop-down
sometimes can be nested,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.209
where you basically open, go ahead,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.849
and you take on a journey,
and you open a nested menu,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.649
and then we hover over another items,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.659
and then another nested
menu shows up.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.389
What a magical, wonderful
moment in life, right?

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.409
You go in, and off you go,
and within a couple of seconds,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.659
you just jump where you need to be.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.039
Unless you don't.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.359
Most of the time, you do not.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.489
Because you do jump
in the nested menu,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.889
and then before you know it,
you cross the wrong boundary,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.079
and then you have to start
over and over again, perhaps,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.579
even multiple times.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.899
That's usually very frustrating.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.800
That's a very unpleasant experience.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.299
This is why, by the way,
just as a side note,

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.489
sometimes you see this big
mega drop-down menu,

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.379
World Trade Organization
website or so,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.099
which had like really three,
four levels of navigation levels.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.389
Three, four levels of navigation,
all displayed at once.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.559
You hover once,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.009
and then you basically see
all these levels at once.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.459
Now, that's a lot, and that often
is totally unnecessary,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.399
but that's usually a better
solution than having this.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.169
Of course, an even better solution

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.449
would be to go
with the tap or click menu.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.699
However, a lot of companies
are very reluctant

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.469
to do that for a very simple reason,

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.019
because they believe
that exposure of people,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.582
exposing people to navigation--

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.369
Yes, exposing navigation to people,

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.139
I should rather say,
is really important,

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.879
especially on ecommerce websites,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.909
so this is why hover
menus are still prevalent,

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.939
although on mobile, of course,
tap and click menus are more common.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.839
What we find, though,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.369
is that whenever you have
an interactive element

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.859
like a search box,
people type in that search box,

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.439
and then you have something
like a hover menu appearing

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.159
around it, whenever it is,
it's usually a cause of trouble.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.049
That's not going to go well.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.159
We could say, "Hold on for a moment,

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.319
we know how to deal with this,
not a big deal.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.149
We can just have delays."

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.059
The problem with delays,
is that sometimes they're too long,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.361
sometimes they're too short, and it's
the same problem that we have

00:22:45.362 --> 00:22:49.488
with mega drop downs on hover,
just even now delayed.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.739
It's not really solving anything.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.869
Now, the solution
came many years ago,

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.319
I think maybe it was
in the early 2000s by Amazon.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.909
The idea was to use
a triangle pattern,

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.399
which means whenever your
pointer is, mouse pointer is,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.869
you basically connect it with
the boundaries of the content area

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.349
where this information
of that section is displayed.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.399
As long as somebody
is navigating within this triangle,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.009
we keep showing the same
content area, so it persists.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.869
It's only when you leave
the triangle,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.539
that actual overview
on the right will change.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.799
That's the point here.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.809
Now, it has been evolving
over the years,

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.979
and so what we find is that,
every now and again,

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.849
you will find a situation where
people are trying to be very careful

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.839
in almost orchestrating
a very careful and thorough

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.093
and minimal SVG exit
path areas over here,

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.010
so whenever people
are moving within this area,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.429
it stays visible,
especially for context menus.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.839
Now, the reason why we
have that is, because,

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.239
very often we have something
really important over here,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.319
and especially,
if you have very long buttons,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.529
very often that triangle
is just way too long,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.799
so people are really taking
it quite seriously here.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.719
Of course, because
we're living in 2025,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.119
at least at the moment
of where I'm recording this,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.109
maybe 30 years from now,

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.299
you'll be looking at this thinking
how stupid that was,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.109
but at the moment, what we try to do,
is to make things responsive.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.359
That means that whenever
we're going up and down,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.359
obviously, this has to be
recalculated every single time,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.979
and so that's quite common.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.139
Of course, it shows up
in context menus.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.958
We want to avoid this.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.799
This is not a great experience.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.527
This is a much better experience.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.109
This could be almost
like a combination of tapping,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.289
clicking, hover,
and delays at the same time.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.089
The way of how this works
is similar to this.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.229
We still have a triangle pattern

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.199
that Amazon has developed,
but if you now click

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.379
into one of the sections
over here, let's say,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.259
you can be actually fixing this area,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.669
and navigating there comfortably,

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.209
especially as long as you're staying
within this triangle.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.599
Then, if you're outside
of the triangle,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.997
it becomes just a hover menu.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.409
Now, you can actually tap
and click and fix if you wanted to,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.929
so that's quite a different story.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.919
Now, what you also could do,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.409
and I think this is really actually
very often forgotten,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.199
overlooked, if we
actually try to build up,

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.449
we could use navigation queries.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.769
This is a way to get people

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.039
where they want to be faster,
without forcing them

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.259
to go through search,
or to go through categories,

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.669
or to go through navigation.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.969
A great example of that is the City
of Dusseldorf website.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.739
On the very home page,
what they get is just two drop-downs.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.219
These drop-downs
are basically saying,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.699
"What do you want to do here?"

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.839
I want to book an appointment.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.520
"Okay, for what?"

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.639
For consultation, and off you go.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.489
Here is a button that you can use
to go straight to the right page.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.872
Here's another example from ao.com,
which is an ecommerce website.

00:25:35.873 --> 00:25:37.179
Here, I have the same story.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.069
What do you want to do here?

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.359
What do you want to buy here?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.259
Washing machine.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.219
Fine.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.260
What kind?

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.019
Front-loader.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.939
Excellent.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.059
How big should it be?

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.939
Big.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.249
You define a price range, and then
you get to 25 relevant products,

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:55.169
four most commonly used filters,
present and exposed,

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.567
right away on the front page.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.919
If you needed to use a navigation,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.139
if you need to use search,
if you need to go for categories,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.879
it would have taken much,
much more time,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.859
which is usually just not necessary.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.809
Sometimes you have a slightly
more complicated navigation

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.669
than this, because
sometimes you have something

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.819
like a multi-level app menu,
because then eventually,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.069
just a matter of time,
every product reaches

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.229
a moment when its navigation
is being challenged

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.159
by the weight of its growth.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.669
It's hard to keep up
with the pace of development

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.199
for pretty much any product.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.927
This is a use case from Intercom.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.089
On Intercom, we have multiple
levels of navigation.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.829
We have a global
navigation over here.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.259
We have another level over here,
which basically matches

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.599
whatever it is that's
selected over here.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.859
Then, whatever is selected over here,

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.019
is matching then whatever
is presented here,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.519
and then it keeps going,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.439
so four different levels that are now
stacked almost vertically.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.119
When it comes to these
icons on the left,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.079
very often you have too many,
and so you need to reorganize.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.909
You need to clean up,
you need to deprioritize,

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.249
and prioritize what matters,

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.209
and you need to maybe
put things together.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.099
We probably know the drill.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.649
What is really significant,
and I think quite helpful,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.720
is to have at least an option
to pin the menu,

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:07.439
the global menu, so people
can actually perceive and read,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.089
and understand those labels.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.469
We usually think
that's not necessary,

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.509
because people learn icons quickly.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.119
Yes, people learn icons very quickly.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.779
At the same time,

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.389
people also forget
those icons very quickly as well,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.149
especially when they don't use
that product that often.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.749
What happens very often,
even if you go ahead and say,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.844
"Okay, I'm going
to bring icons somehow,

00:27:28.017 --> 00:27:29.999
all unnecessary, or unneeded icons,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.729
behind the settings button,"
what happens is,

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.259
it becomes a bit
of an issue, because people

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.589
don't necessarily remember
what each icon represents.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.239
In the case of Intercom though,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.259
they just reorganized
and restructured, in a way.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.289
They introduced this pattern

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.692
which I've never seen
before, to be honest,

00:27:44.693 --> 00:27:46.409
where on the one hand
you have the plus,

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.809
which allows you to add a new
person, add a new company,

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.379
but you also at the same
time also have right there

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.289
an accordion that kind of opens
up people and companies and so on.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.109
According to them,
it was working actually really well.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.719
Maybe that's a safe
way to use as well.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.040
I would still say
that when we look at the icons,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.089
it might be a good idea
to at least give people some sort

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.869
of a way to read those labels
as well, if you can.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.319
On mobile, it might be difficult,
of course, but on desktop it isn't.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.509
If you have something like this here,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.609
it might be just
difficult to understand

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.739
what a particular icon
represents, and so something

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.379
like a label is usually always
a good idea to do,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.349
if you can afford it,
if you have enough place.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.879
This is usually a good investment,

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.209
and you'll probably see
a lot of people benefiting

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.459
from it, most of the time,

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.679
because you don't have to remember
now what that icon represented,

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.379
even if you feel like you
have only a few icons there.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.409
Some icons are more obvious,
but it's really rare,

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.219
because most of the time only a few
icons are universally understood.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.339
Most of them are ambiguous,
or have to be decoded.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.439
There are challenges
between similar areas,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.649
like Create versus Edit,
or Save versus Archive.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.839
Also, scanning
10 words might be faster

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.099
and easier than scanning 10 icons,
especially if they're confusing.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.559
Obviously, we want
to ideally avoid relying

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.239
on powerful explanations,
for example tooltips.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.155
I'm very allergic to tooltips.

00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:11.219
If you have something
important to say, or to show,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.129
or to explain, you probably
want to just explain it.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.139
If it's, let's say,
a very lengthy explanation,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.019
then it might be an inline accordion,
rather than a tooltip.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.439
I'm not sure we absolutely need
tooltips at all times.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.259
Also, just as users
learn unlabeled icons,

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.751
they also often
and very quickly forget them.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.919
That's some stuff that we want
to keep in mind about navigation.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.819
Now, in drag-and-drop,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.729
whenever we start moving
cards around, obviously,

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.229
this is a very intense procedure,
so to say, that requires precision,

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.604
depending on what you're
actually moving or dragging.

00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:44.619
It could be, of course,
columns, it could be cards,

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.939
but it could also be
resizing a columns,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.379
or it could also be moving
columns around,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.639
or anything of that kind,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.919
so we need to be quite
careful with that as well.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.659
Typically, in the context of cards,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.909
which means that we actually
need to enable people

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:02.730
to lift something, move something,
and drop something in a new place.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.999
That usually represents itself
again in many different places.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.759
This is like this for,
let's say, rows.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.458
This is for columns,
so you might want to resize or so,

00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:14.279
or you might want
to copy-paste, maybe even.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.090
Here, again, resizing the columns.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.389
Here, this is what you would do

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.079
when you actually
want to move something,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.999
like move rows around, or move
columns around, like maybe this.

00:30:25.018 --> 00:30:28.949
Of course, it requires support
of Tab, Shift, Space, and Arrow keys.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.679
What it typically means,
is that there must be

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.379
a way for people to select something

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.659
by tabbing through it, and so,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.479
focusing on an item
that they want to do something with,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.169
then grab that item
with the Spacebar right here,

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.609
then drag and move item

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.219
with Arrow keys up and down,
left and right, if needed.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.849
Then, drop that item
with the Spacebar as well.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.999
That also goes for mobile.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.749
Mobile, very often, you would have

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.509
an option as an alternative
to do something else,

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.549
where you can have,
let's say, a checkbox.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.169
Select the checkbox,
and then you can move up

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.859
and move down as well,
or you can also have this menu,

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.839
which allows people
to move up and down.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.409
This also goes for things
like drag-and-drop files,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.939
or anything similar as well.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.269
That's actually, then,
of course, quite common.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.659
However, I think,
there is one more thing

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.039
that's really, really consequential,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.589
and very often very difficult
for people to get right,

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.449
and that's how to deal with states,

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.379
especially hidden states,
disabled state, and read-only state.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.569
Now, this is coming
from the Goldman Sachs design system,

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.579
and the idea here
is that to indicate,

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.379
in a progress bar, different states.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.189
Complete, active, incomplete,
disabled, error, and warning state.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.459
All of them have a different role
to play, and so, very often,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.679
you will be thinking about
something like a UI stack,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.339
which is something that's been coined
by Scott Hurff a while back.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.799
He was mentioning
that most of the time,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.937
we are looking
at ideal state, which is,

00:31:50.938 --> 00:31:53.849
as he called it, the zenith
of your product's potential.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.179
Then, it's error state,
the partial state, the loading state,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.579
where things often
really need to be communicated

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.049
to keep people on the ball.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.389
We can't do much with the blank
state, although, you can,

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.539
of course, do some offline
caching and stuff like that.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.699
It's also helpful,
but this is where experience breaks

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.739
or makes, or is made, I should say.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.589
This is a really crucial part here.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.939
There is a wonderful
research done by Eric Bailey,

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.079
in which he went in all
the fine details of UI states,

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.699
and there are plenty of them.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.009
It's not like you need
all of them to be designed,

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.769
but very often, you will need
to consider them, at least,

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.919
when you're actually designing
some specific components.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.145
For example, when it comes
to input fields, it might be hidden,

00:32:32.146 --> 00:32:34.079
it might be read-only,
it might be disabled.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.349
You're looking to checked
and unchecked state,

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.387
indeterminate if you have groups,
selected, unselected,

00:32:38.388 --> 00:32:42.179
dragged, dropped, collapsed,
expanded, and the sky is the limit,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.909
because you can also have
a table, have resizing,

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.399
have a dirty input,
which means it has been changed,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.549
but it's not saved yet, saving,
overflowing, scrolling,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.539
playing, pause, stopped,
again, when it comes

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.009
to video player, imported,
and it just keeps going.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.289
I want to focus on three,
because very often,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.190
they're a big source of frustration.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.544
Disabled, hidden, read-only.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.419
Now, all these variants
indicate the same thing,

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.079
but do so very differently.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.650
They indicate restrictions
and unavailability,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.859
but they do so really
quite differently.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.469
They are not interchangeable,
and I think I want to emphasize that.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.209
They are not interchangeable,

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.509
and they can apply to both content,
and to actions as well.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.809
Let's go through them
to understand what it means.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.299
First of all, when
a component is disabled,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.969
it means that people are not,
or users are not allowed

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.439
to interact with it in some way.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.539
Maybe it's permissions,
maybe it's dependencies,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.919
maybe it's requirements,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.489
maybe just missing validation
or something like that.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.459
Usually, disabled buttons,
especially disabled buttons,

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.799
are the most expensive
buttons out there,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.699
because a lot of people never know

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.899
how to actually make
a disabled button enabled.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.119
This really shows up
in many different places.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.429
For example, probably most of you,

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.949
and please write in the plus,
in the chat if you can,

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.259
most of you had experienced
this in the past,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.239
where you maybe want to buy an item,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.909
and you add your address
to ship the item to your address,

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.249
and you've been living
there for 10 years,

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.058
but the validator tells you,
"No, you are wrong."

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:11.939
What are you supposed to do?

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.299
This almost guarantees
100% abandonment, right?

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.559
This is a situation where people

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.049
need to be able to understand
how to recover from that.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.849
Very often, what I would suggest,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.109
let's measure how much
money we're leaving

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.869
at the table by not allowing
people to proceed,

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.529
despite their address being wrong,
according to our validator,

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.819
and how much money we'll be earning

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.946
if we actually let people
to overwrite our validator,

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.188
but can we even do that?

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.359
This can have quite a difference.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.439
With disabled buttons,
disabled states,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.399
they cannot be clicked, selected,
or interacted with by default.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.119
They're inaccessible to keyboard
and screen reader users as well.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.139
If using just disabled,
that's a problem,

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.709
so we need to aria-disabled,
and then do quite a bit of work

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.079
around to actually make it work.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.869
Now, this would typically
look like this.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.299
You hover on the item,
because you can focus

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.569
on it by default, and then
you get this notification.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.299
Notification being
just the cursor change.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.239
This also goes
for say menus like this.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.659
Often, it would be like an experience

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.617
that would be looking like this.

00:35:12.618 --> 00:35:15.509
We basically go in and we need
to select something,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.189
and then the buttons become enabled,

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.449
but you can need
to know what you're doing.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.659
Sometimes it's obvious,
and sometimes it isn't.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.999
There are some cases
for disableness, right?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.189
For example, you might have
temporary unavailable items,

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.589
which means you may be waiting
for user's action,

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.659
or you might have dependencies
in the compatibility,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.369
maybe filters mismatch,

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.349
or you have an action
that's not available yet.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.039
Maybe like export
is currently in progress.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.979
Maybe again missing permissions
or rights, we need to upgrade.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.819
We need to ask administrator,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.999
or it might be triggered
by user's action or inaction,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.669
where they need
to choose an option first.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.539
Also, might be a thing

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.819
that you actually just want
to prevent multiple clicks,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.898
like adding to cart, or double
transactions, or anything similar.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.259
That usually is quite difficult.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.499
Because, of course,
it's usually going to have

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.515
poor visual contrast,
lack of feedback.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.179
At least, at the very
minimum, we need to add

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.029
a hint or inline warning
to explain it to users.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.849
Usually, we'll get something
like 25%-50% opacity,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.099
and change cursor
to not-allowed, but if I could,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.929
I would just keep
the buttons enabled,

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.049
and then disable them
only if they're clicked.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.950
Let's say maybe something like this.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.989
Maybe something like that
to prevent double clicking,

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.119
so that might be more
reasonable to have.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.579
That's disabled state.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.679
We also have a hidden state.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.259
Now, a component is hidden,

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.619
when the user can't locate
it anywhere in the UI,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.439
and the user cannot really know
that the option is available at all.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.553
That's basically means
we're removing it altogether.

00:36:40.554 --> 00:36:41.519
Why would you remove it,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.199
if somebody will never
be able to use it?

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.302
Why keep it, right?

00:36:44.303 --> 00:36:46.229
If you have something
like Edit routes in access,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.799
which might be reserved
for administrators, let's say,

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.559
but you're not an administrator,
but just a user,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.679
then you basically will
be hiding this option.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.229
Now, there are a few candidates
for hidden as well.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.299
The critical one
is insufficient permissions,

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.979
because it can be used anyway,

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.409
or the component
is active very rarely.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.349
Like, for example, maybe
you have a video stream once a month,

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.519
but why would you want to show

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.379
a video stream
prominently all the time?

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.059
You just hide it, or the features

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.119
that isn't accessible,
again, admin buttons,

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.859
or any kind of overrides
that require some privileges,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.699
or irrelevant attributes, or maybe
sensitive data, let's say PIN code.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.379
You don't want to hide it,
you will be probably

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.059
using asterisks
or something like that.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.649
You don't make it visible.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.299
Again, it might be something
that's just not relevant

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.099
for the user, or unavailable options.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.959
Like, for example,
you cannot bulk edit

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.969
without selecting the items first.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.969
This is what we see
in Gmail and everywhere else as well.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.699
It could also be just,
it's done, it's archived,

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.262
it's deleted, cleaning up mode.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.159
Hiding, however,
always has one downside,

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.492
and that it actually
hurts discoverability.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.889
Usually, when we
actually have something

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.779
that is not available yet,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.271
but maybe it's not available
because of the--

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.589
Maybe there is a two filters
that cannot work together,

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.749
it's probably a bad idea
to hide one of them,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.729
because people get confused.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.339
We want to show hidden items
near the control that hides it,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.729
or shows it, ideally,
because otherwise

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.939
you might find it difficult
to discover them.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.999
We also might allow users
to opt out, for example,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.579
Hide/Show unavailable
options if they really need to.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.679
We might want to hide sections

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.549
with a lot of disabled
functionality, because again,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.759
it's probably going to confuse
more people than help,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.479
and so when it comes
to bulk experience,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.520
not surprising, when we're
selecting, let's say,

00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:26.189
a couple of options,
it's only then when those items

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.840
become available,
but by default, they are not.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.499
Then, we have a read-only state.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.359
Now, with a read-only state,

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.019
a user cannot interact
with the component,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.179
but they can still read
and review it.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.819
It's also accessible
to the screen reader, by the way.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.859
It's informative,
but not interactive.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.389
Informative, but not interactive.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:43.939
You cannot change it.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.699
It also, therefore,
should not suggest any interactivity.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.279
Now typically, it could
look like this here,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.859
where you basically have
this data right here,

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.059
but you can't really change it.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.209
This is also very common
for something like maybe great,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.919
slightly great background,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.769
we have a copy-paste link,
or something similar.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.001
That's not very surprising.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.029
How do we deal with read-only?

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.196
Disabled, but relevant for the task.

00:39:08.197 --> 00:39:10.469
If you have something
like auto-generated invoice ID

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.439
that you shouldn't be able
to change, but you probably

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.149
need to be able to reference it,
or know that it exists,

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.589
that's a good idea to have it.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.359
If you want to display
pre-populated data

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.559
that can't be changed, well,

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.319
ID prefix could be helpful
there, for example.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.919
Permissions allow viewing,
but not necessarily editing.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.339
In that case, for docs or sheets,
you might have a read-only state,

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.829
or maybe you have a value
or status that is relevant,

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.879
but not really editable.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.609
Maybe it has been calculated
with a formula,

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.498
a VAT or tax, but it's not
up to you to change it.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.246
It should not serve as a replacement
for static information.

00:39:44.247 --> 00:39:47.099
It should not serve as an alternative
for the disabled state.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.509
This is, I think,
is actually quite important,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.579
because it really is different,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.949
so it will not become
enabled in some way.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.579
This is why there is no point
to have a disabled state for it.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.979
At the same time,
it should not look like

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.179
a regular text either, because again,

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.839
that needs to communicate
it's actually read-only for a reason.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.579
Typically, used for form
text fields, but not buttons.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.939
Content is focusable,
accessible to screen readers as well.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.279
We probably want to use it instead

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.309
of disabled state
if it needs to be read.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.619
Again, 25%-50% opacity,
but we don't change

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.689
the cursor to not allowed here.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.849
Sometimes it might be
difficult to tell apart.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.519
One part of here is enabled,
the other is read-only.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.503
Can you tell them apart?

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.745
This is enabled,
and this is read-only.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.789
Of course, it might be very
difficult to tell them apart.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.489
The same goes for here,
another product right here.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.719
This one, one of them is read-only,
and one of them is disabled.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.400
Which one is which?

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.539
This one is disabled,
and this one is read-only,

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.969
but it's really difficult
to tell them apart.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.269
How do we deal with that then,
and how do we design for it?

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.799
Typically, you might
even want to include

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.839
a badge that depends, of course,
on what you have here.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.659
If you have the entire
section being read-only,

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.709
you might want
to indicate it some way.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.119
That's probably a safe bet.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.679
Here indicating that it's disabled,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.289
but it's actually
when the design looks exactly

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:06.819
the same in both,
that becomes a problem.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.339
There was a wonderful
discussion happening

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.279
on the IBM GitHub repo
around how to design.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.299
I actually like this
idea quite a bit.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.749
I actually could interact
with the option,

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.699
which would be explaining
that it's not editable,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.579
and it will explain
to you what is going on here.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.699
It would be, of course, ideal

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.819
if you could actually
tap or click into it.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.559
This is, you can find it
on Read-Only Form Controls over here.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.109
Sometimes you also see
all of these working together

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.019
like this, where you cannot change
the credit card number,

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.939
because it's again
at this point read-only,

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.667
but then you can change the rest.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.489
Of course, it must be
responsive as well.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.729
Now, when we look into all of this,
this is a little decision tree

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.649
that I've put together
to make it work.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.209
This is how I would
make the decision,

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.669
because I often didn't know
how to answer that question.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.629
What should be hidden?

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:52.639
What should be disabled?

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.899
What should be read-only?

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.249
If a component
is limited in some way,

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.790
then we probably
need to do something.

00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:01.758
If it isn't, then we just show
it in default state.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.959
If it's not useful,
or maybe not allowed,

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.809
or incompatible, then we need
to do something with it.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:07.819
The question then is,

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.579
will a user ever be able to interact
with this component,

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.819
for example, by reading,
by selecting,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.019
by copying, by clicking,
or anything similar?

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.439
If the answer is, "No", then it needs
to be in a hidden state.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.339
If the user can never use it,
what's the point?

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.339
We probably want
to remove it from a toolbar,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.299
maybe design how and when to show it,
or anything similar.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.339
If the answer is, "Yes",
then the question is,

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.579
is it mostly informational,
or mostly interactive?

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.199
Now, what does that mean?

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.759
When we look into
mostly informational,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.269
that means that, actually,
it's just for people to be read.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.019
Can users edit it on other pages,
but not on the current one?

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.769
If the answer is, "Yes",
they can edit it somewhere else.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.409
Then, on that page we're going
to show it as a read-only state.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:53.579
Also, I want to explain why,
and it shouldn't look interactive.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.099
If it's not, then we need
to display static text.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.319
It's mostly informational--

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.819
Hold on, let's go back.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.799
It's mostly informational,
the user will not be able to--

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.879
The user will be able to actually
interact with it,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.829
so no point of hiding it.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.589
That means that it will
be in a static text.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.129
If it's mostly interactive,
or maybe a button,

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.769
then the question is,
can it stay enabled at all times?

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.759
Usually, the answer is, "Yes",
so we show it in a default state.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.759
Maybe we're showing
errors on tap or on click.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.199
If the answer is, "No",

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.209
is it actually used
to prevent critical mistakes,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.539
like double orders, deletion,
or something like that?

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.229
If the answer is, "No",
then I would say again default state.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.569
It's only if the answer is, "Yes",

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.999
then we might want
to move to a disabled state

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.879
by being accessible
and focusable with aria-disabled.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.769
Of course, as we know,
this requires quite

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.379
a bit of work on its own as well.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.499
This is at least how
I would make that decision.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.839
Just one more thing
that I want to mention about this,

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.331
is that when it comes
to disabled interfaces,

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.359
it's really difficult
to get them right.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.149
Disabled state is an indicator
that something is wrong.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.729
People actually understand
that it's not them that's a problem,

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.119
that something
is missing in the interface,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.539
and that they need to fix it.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.119
The issue is that very often
they don't know how to fix it,

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.249
and then it becomes
an actual problem,

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.159
and so when you're thinking
about any sort of improvement,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.319
probably something like this,
clicking on a button,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.999
and being able
to interact with the people,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.399
tell the person
what actually has happened,

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.732
might be a good,
or bad idea at this point.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.059
Also, on top of that,

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.349
what I would highly suggest
is to actually allow people

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:32.459
to override validator when you feel
like this might benefit the users,

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.022
and also with it your business.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.929
With that, now we could keep
going for a while, I think,

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.039
but what I actually wanted

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.499
to communicate is that,
when we're looking

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.269
into some of the issues
that we have here,

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.919
it seems like the journey

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.306
that we've been taking on,
in terms of accessibility

00:44:49.307 --> 00:44:51.744
and inclusive design,
has been a long one.

00:44:51.745 --> 00:44:53.759
Yet, unfortunately, most of the time,

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.203
we are not getting the basics right,
which we just could.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.499
I'm not trying to be this
grumpy person telling you,

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.819
"Hey, I should be doing it this way,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.319
I should be doing it that way."

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.809
I just feel like, very often, you
can gain a lot of wins, quick wins,

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.780
by doing things
that are just simpler,

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.299
and maybe slightly more boring.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.509
Because when we look at the data,
what people are complaining,

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.249
and when we look
at the data of what people do,

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.479
it's always the same story.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.909
People like fast
and accessible experiences.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.219
People like large and legible text.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.919
People like large checkboxes
that look like checkboxes,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.379
and like radio buttons
that look like radio buttons.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.469
They even like when input
boxes look like input boxes,

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.499
but they also like when
you have a proper focus

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.239
and active state
that they can understand.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.349
Simple password requirements,

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.599
predictable tabbing,
helpful error messages,

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.263
smart and fast autocomplete,
when user input persists on refresh,

00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:50.063
when they accidentally hit refresh,
and the data is not lost.

00:45:50.064 --> 00:45:53.359
The drop-down opens on tap and click,
rather than on hover,

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.639
or maybe both on tap
and click and on hover.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.139
Also, things like easy undos,
edits, and cancellations.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.999
People are afraid
of free things in life.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.699
It's usually snakes,
it's usually spiders,

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.619
and it's usually the Back
button in the browser,

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.269
so if the Back button
is predictable, meaning,

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.069
there is a button
in the UI saying "Back"

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.529
and it works as expected,
that's fantastic.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.559
When people can snooze
notifications and return back,

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.239
or maybe pause
subscription for a while,

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.999
and bring them back,
and also transparent pricing.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.469
This is what people want.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.949
Thank you so much for taking
the time, and here are cats,

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.530
and more cats, and I hope
that some of the insights

00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:30.619
that I brought together
here today will be useful,

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.269
and wishing a wonderful
rest of the conference.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:37.030
I'm looking forward to answer
your question in just a minute.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.509
Joe Dolson: Sorry, I was muted.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.259
Our emcee for this session
has unexpectedly frozen,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:50.669
so I am spontaneously taking
on closing out this session.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.719
I'm sorry to tell you that
our keynote speaker, Vitaly Friedman,

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.449
was unable to attend
for Q&A at the last minute,

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.411
and we will not be able
to have Q&A with him.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.299
Fortunately, his talk
was quite exceptional,

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.979
and covered a lot of ground,
so we are almost out of time as well.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.124
We recommend that you visit
his speaker page on the event website

00:47:14.125 --> 00:47:16.769
to find his social media
contact information,

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.659
and then I'm supposed to transition

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:20.969
into the normal closing script,
which I didn't have open,

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.144
because I wasn't planning
to be an emcee.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.299
In summary, please go to our website

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.979
to provide feedback on this session,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.719
and on all other sessions you get.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.959
That can be found
at wpaccessibility.day,

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.939
the feedback page.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.419
It's in the main
navigation, I believe.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.139
I could be wrong.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.569
If you're logged in,
it's in the navigation.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.489
Please stick around
for our next session,

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.850
which will be in just
10 more minutes.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.970
I am unprepared for this,
so give me some time.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.849
The next session
is Being a Colorblind Designer

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.439
with Matt Roberts.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.419
It'll happen at 16:00 UTC,

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.079
and join that next session
as soon as it happens.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.760
Thank you very much.
