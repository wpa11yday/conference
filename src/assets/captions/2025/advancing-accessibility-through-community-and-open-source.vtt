>> CHRIS HINDS: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.480
My name is Chris Hinds and I'm
the COO at Equalize Digital.

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.930
Thank you for joining us for Advancing
Accessibility Through Community

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.764
and Open Source with Samuel Osei.

00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:50.130
Samuel is a community leader
who fosters local engagement

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.800
as the WordPress Meetup organizer
in Kumasi,

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:58.291
Ghana, while also supporting users
worldwide in the WordPress support forums.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.461

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.900
>> SAMUEL OSEI: Good morning, good afternoon,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920
or good evening wherever
you are joining from.

00:02:23.257 --> 00:02:27.907
Thank you for being part
of this important conversation today.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.039
My name is Samuel Osei and I am honored
to discuss a topic that is truly vital

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.340
for the future of the digital world,
Advancing Accessibility Through Community

00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:42.870
and Open Source.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.050
Before we begin,

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.632
I want you to take
a moment and consider this.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.789
How many times today
have you already interacted

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.961
with a website, an app, or a digital tool?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.160
Perhaps you checked
your email this morning,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.260
scrolled through social media,

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.400
or even registered
for this very event online.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.250
For many of us,

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.650
these interactions are seamless,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.660
almost invincible,

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.510
but for millions of people
around the world,

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:22.171
specifically over 1 billion people
with disabilities,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.920
these same interactions
can be filled with frustration,

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:29.700
confusion, or worse,
complete impossibility.

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:34.857
Today, we are going
to explore not just why this matters,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.330
but more importantly,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.589
what we can do about it
and what we are already doing about it

00:03:40.837 --> 00:03:43.800
through practical community-driven action.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.120
Before we delve into the core material,
let me briefly introduce myself and share

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:57.840
why this work
is so personal and important to me.

00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:00.200
As I mentioned earlier,

00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:07.348
my name is Samuel Osei
and you can find me online as Osei AGM.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:11.266
O-S-E-I A-G-M.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.850
I work as a software engineer building
digital solutions that I hope make

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.401
people's life easier and more connected.

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:27.330
I also serve as a community manager,
which means I spend a lot of my time

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.190
connecting with people,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.451
creating networks of support,
and enabling collaboration,

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:36.990
and proudly, I am a Ghanaian.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.260
This blend of community involvement
and technical expertise drives

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:44.341
my commitment

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.661
to making technology
truly open and accessible to all.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:53.520
Throughout my career,
I've witnessed firsthand

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.880
how the right training,
the right community,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.490
and the right tools
can completely transform

00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:00.930
someone's trajectory.

00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.628
I've seen individuals go
from feeling excluded by technology

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.880
to becoming confident digital creators.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:13.561
That transformation is what fuels
my work every single day.

00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:17.800
Ghana, like many countries
in the global South,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.870
faces unique challenges
when it comes to digital inclusion.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.951
We have brilliant minds,
incredible creativity,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.115
and strong community bonds,
but we also have

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.510
infrastructure challenges,
economic barriers,

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.587
and yes, significant accessibility gaps.

00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:41.250
This contest makes our work
even more urgent and,

00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:43.590
I believe, even more impactful.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.820
Over the next 30 minutes
or so, we will navigate

00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:56.071
through several key areas
that structure our discussion today.

00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:00.351
We will start by establishing
the foundational importance

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.890
of accessibility

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.129
in our introduction before moving
to define the challenge faced by people

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.721
with disabilities globally.

00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:15.150
Then, we will explore the opportunity
that inclusive training offers

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.630
and discuss WordPress
as a catalyst for change.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.241
The heart of this presentation
lies in the TechAble Initiative,

00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:27.719
detailing our approach,
including mentorship

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.951
for participants,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.311
and our specific focus
on gender inclusion.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.374
Following that, we will review
the tangible impact our work is having

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:40.501
and discuss the lessons
we've learned along the way.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.080
Finally, we will close
with a call to action

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.431
for how you can be part of this movement.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.121
Let's start
with a non-negotiable principle.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.630
Accessibility is not optional.

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.720
This is more than a slogan.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.486
It is an ethical and often legal mandate
that defines how we should build

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:07.561
the digital world.

00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:09.811
Why must we start here?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.740
Because,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.400
despite the digital evolution,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.351
despite the fact that we can video call
someone on the other side of the planet,

00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:25.140
access the world's information instantly,
and work from virtually anywhere,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.270
people with disabilities

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:32.401
or PWDs continue to face
significant barriers

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:34.950
in accessing education globally.

00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.280
Think about the sheer amount of knowledge,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.081
training, and opportunities
that are delivered exclusively online.

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:46.170
Universities have moved courses online.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.735
Professional certifications are digital.

00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:52.657
Job applications happen
through web portals.

00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:57.630
Freelance marketplaces
operate entirely in the digital space.

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.470
If those pathways
are structurally inaccessible,

00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:06.270
we are systematically excluding
millions of people from obtaining

00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:11.641
the necessary skills to participate fully
in modern society and the economy.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.811
Let me put this in perspective
with some statistics.

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:18.751
According
to the World Health Organization,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.654
approximately 16%
of the global population,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.170
that's 1.3 billion people,

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.751
experience significant disability.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.080
In the context of education
and employment,

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:37.199
studies show that people with disabilities
are significantly less likely to complete

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.819
secondary education and face
unemployment rates that are two

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.761
to three times higher
than those without disabilities.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.510
Addressing this gap,
this systemic exclusion

00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:54.719
from education, is the first critical step
in ensuring genuine inclusion for persons

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.741
with disabilities,

00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.410
but here's the crucial point.

00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.670
When we build accessible systems,
everyone benefits.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.991
Captions help not just deaf users,
but also people watching videos

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.300
in noisy environments,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.600
or those learning in a second language.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.791
Keyboard navigation helps not just users
with motor disabilities,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.800
but also power users who want
to work more efficiently.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.820
Clear, simple language
helps not just users

00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:30.630
with cognitive disabilities,
but everyone trying to understand

00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.861
complex information.

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.970
Accessibility is good design,
it's universal design,

00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:38.340
and it's simply the right thing to do.

00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:46.269
The digital divide for persons
with disabilities is created

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.881
by a combination of technical failure
and social exclusion.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.960
The challenges we currently face

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.871
can be distilled
into four critical barriers,

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:05.050
but I want to spend time really unpacking
each one so you can understand

00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:09.251
the lived reality
behind these technical descriptions.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.180
Firstly,

00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:15.311
we contend
with inaccessible platforms and tools.

00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:18.911
Many mainstream learning
management systems,

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:20.501
collaboration tools,

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:25.931
and general software are designed
without disabled users in mind.

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:30.220
This means navigation
is impossible for some,

00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:36.337
or essential functions are unusable,
locking out individuals

00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:38.680
before they even begin to learn.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.401
Let me give you a concrete example.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.801
Imagine you're a blind student
trying to enroll in an online course.

00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:51.790
You navigate to the website
using your screen reader,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.901
software that reads the test
on screen aloud to you,

00:10:57.221 --> 00:11:02.441
but the course registration form
wasn't coded with accessibility in mind.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.810
The form fields don't have proper labels,
so your screen reader just says,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.170
edit books,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.783
without telling you
what information to put there.

00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:18.401
The submit button is actually
an image without an alternative test,

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:24.071
so you don't even know
where to click to submit your form.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.691
The course you want
to take might be perfect for you,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.185
but you can't even register
because the gateway is locked.

00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:39.251
This isn't a hypothetical scenario,
this happens every single day

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.541
to millions of people
trying to access education,

00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.720
employment, and essential services online.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:53.050
Secondly, there is
the pervasive issue of training content

00:11:53.051 --> 00:11:54.370
without captions.

00:11:55.062 --> 00:11:58.300
While captions
might seem like a small detail to those

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.651
who don't rely on them,

00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:04.451
the lack of them instantly renders
educational videos,

00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:08.134
lectures,
and virtual training inaccessible

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.221
to individuals who are deaf
or hard of hearing.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.590
This exclusion narrows
the available educational contents

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.700
dramatically.

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:23.950
Consider the explosion
of video-based learning.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.980
Platforms like YouTube,

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.531
Coursera, and Udemy have democratized
education in many ways.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.810
You can learn almost anything
from world-class instructors,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.781
but if you are deaf or hard of hearing
and the video doesn't have captions,

00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.230
that entire course is closed to you.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.041
You might be the most motivated learner
in the world,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.261
but motivation can't overcome
a fundamental technical barrier.

00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:02.561
Here's what frustrates me most
about this particular barrier.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.160
Adding captions is entirely achievable.

00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:08.170
The technology exists.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.980
Automatic captioning
has improved dramatically.

00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:15.371
Manual captioning services are affordable.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.121
The barrier here
isn't technical impossibility,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.250
it's lack of awareness,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.121
lack of priority,
and sometimes lack of care.

00:13:27.075 --> 00:13:30.988
Thirdly, we often see a fundamental lack
of assistive technology support.

00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:38.051
Assistive technologies
such as screen readers for blind users,

00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:42.100
voice recognition software
for those with motor disabilities,

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.632
or switch control for users
with limited mobility are essential tools.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.781
When platforms are poorly coded,
they conflict with these tools,

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:55.150
rendering technology useless.

00:13:57.731 --> 00:14:01.061
If a screen reader
cannot correctly interpret

00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:02.711
a website structure,

00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:06.394
that website remains closed off.

00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:12.189
This barrier is particularly insidious
because it's often invincible

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.090
to developers who don't use
assistive technology themselves.

00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:20.710
A website might look perfectly functional
in a standard browser,

00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:24.280
but be completely unusable
with a screen reader.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.660
Developers might use
the latest JavaScript framework and create

00:14:28.673 --> 00:14:33.520
beautiful animations,
but if they don't consider

00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:40.240
semantic HTML or keyboard navigations,
they've built a beautiful building

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.290
with no doors.

00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.041
I want to emphasize
something important here.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.111
Assistive technology users

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.591
incredibly resourceful and determined.

00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:54.521
They will try workarounds,
they will spend extra hours

00:14:54.701 --> 00:14:57.550
trying to make something work,
they will seek help

00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:58.990
from their networks,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.820
but the burden should not be on them
to constantly adapt to our failures.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.790
The burden should be on us as creators
to build right from the start.

00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:16.421
Finally and critically,
there's limited community support.

00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:21.371
Technical barriers are often compounded
by social isolation.

00:15:21.881 --> 00:15:25.780
When persons with disabilities
pursue technical training,

00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:34.420
they need not only technical resources,
but a strong supportive peer network

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.170
where they can share
challenges, find mentorship,

00:15:38.411 --> 00:15:39.971
and feel represented.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:46.751
A lack of this community support can lead
to attrition and limit long-term success.

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:51.520
Think about your own learning journey,
whether you learned to code,

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.820
learned a new language,
or developed a new skill.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.090
Who helped you?

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.161
Maybe it was a friend
who recommended a good resource.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.450
Maybe it was a study group
that kept you motivated.

00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:09.460
Maybe it was a mentor who believed in you
when you doubted yourself.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.927
Maybe it was just seeing someone
who looked like you succeeding

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:17.111
in that field and thinking
if they can do it too,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320
so can I.

00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:22.991
Now imagine trying to break
into the tech industry,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:29.020
an industry already known for
being exclusive and sometimes unwelcoming,

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:32.321
without any of those support structures.

00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:37.718
Imagine being one of the only people
with a disability in your course,

00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:40.151
in your boot camp, in a workplace.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:46.240
Imagine not having anyone who understands
the specific challenges you face

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:51.611
or who can give you advice
that actually applies to your situation.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:55.331
This isolation doesn't just make
the journey harder,

00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:59.621
it makes people give up entirely,
and when that happens,

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.970
we all lose.

00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:04.331
We lose their perspective,
their creativity,

00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:07.840
their contributions,
and their potential leadership.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.670
While the challenges are formidable,
the opportunity to transform lives

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.240
through inclusive training
is even greater.

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:23.771
By intentionally designing
training programs for accessibility,

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.141
we unlock profound benefits,

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.420
not just for the participants,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.120
but for society as a whole.

00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:36.580
I want to shift our mindset here
from seeing accessibility as a problem

00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:40.480
to solve, to seeing it
as an opportunity to seize.

00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:44.920
Because when we get this right,
the benefits ripple out

00:17:44.921 --> 00:17:47.800
in ways you might not even anticipate.

00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:50.661
Firstly,

00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:57.100
inclusive training provides crucial access
to jobs and entrepreneurship.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.590
Digital skills are highly valuable
and often location-independent,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.660
making them ideal for persons
with disabilities who may face

00:18:07.661 --> 00:18:12.760
mobility challenges or discrimination
in traditional workplaces.

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:18.491
These skills directly translate
into economic opportunities.

00:18:19.481 --> 00:18:23.590
The digital economy
has fundamentally changed what's possible

00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:24.919
for employment.

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:30.071
A talented web developer in Accra
can work for a client in London,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.346
New York, or Tokyo.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.909
A skilled digital marketer
can run campaigns from anywhere

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.530
with an internet connection.

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:42.580
A graphic designer can build
a thriving freelance business

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.281
without ever commuting to an office.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.301
For people with disabilities
who might face

00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:53.231
physical barriers
in traditional office environments,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.470
who might experience
discrimination in hiring,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.500
or who might need
flexible work arrangements,

00:18:59.691 --> 00:19:01.330
the digital economy

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.040
represents

00:19:03.616 --> 00:19:08.019
unprecedented opportunity,
but only if they have the skills

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.020
to access it.

00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:11.861
Here's the economic reality.

00:19:11.891 --> 00:19:17.081
The tech sector is growing faster
than almost any other industry.

00:19:17.381 --> 00:19:20.591
There's a global shortage
of qualified tech workers.

00:19:20.831 --> 00:19:23.380
Companies are desperate to find talent.

00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:26.800
If we can successfully train
people with disabilities

00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:30.790
in these in-demand skills,
we are not doing charity.

00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:37.151
We are meeting market demand
while simultaneously advancing inclusion.

00:19:39.431 --> 00:19:44.441
Secondly, this access
fosters greater independence.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.879
Economic empowerment
through employment leads directly

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.430
to financial and social independence,

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:55.210
allowing individuals
to control their own futures

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.300
and participate more actively
in the economy.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.240
Independence is dignity,

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:07.179
is the ability to make your own choices,
support yourself and potentially

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.840
your family, and live life
on your own terms.

00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:15.219
When people with disabilities
are systematically excluded

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.051
from economic opportunities,
they often become dependent

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.861
on family members,
social services, or charity.

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:27.669
While support systems
are important, the ability

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.001
to be economically self-sufficient
is transformative.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.440
I've witnessed this transformation
personally through our program.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.241
Participants who entered

00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:41.679
uncertain about their prospects,
who had been told explicitly

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.731
or implicitly

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.631
that certain careers weren't for them,

00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:50.669
who had internalized
society's low expectations,

00:20:50.893 --> 00:20:54.460
these same participants now run
their own freelance businesses,

00:20:54.762 --> 00:20:58.091
earn competitive salaries,
and more importantly,

00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:02.050
see themselves as valuable contributions
to the digital economy.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.366
That shift in self-perception from,
I need help, to,

00:21:07.438 --> 00:21:12.611
I have valuable skills to offer,
that's the shift that changes everything.

00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:18.970
Thirdly, we achieve
digital participation and representation.

00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:25.270
When people with disabilities are skilled
and employed in the digital economy,

00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:28.566
they cease being mere consumers
of technology

00:21:28.616 --> 00:21:31.150
and become creators and shapers of it.

00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:36.820
Their perspectives are essential
for building truly inclusive products,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.711
thereby increasing representation
across the tech landscape.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.310
Here's a hard truth
about the tech industry,

00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:47.620
we have a diversity problem.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:53.050
The people building our digital future
don't represent the diversity of people

00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:53.881
who use it,

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:57.010
and when the builders aren't diverse,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.240
the products reflect the lack
of diversity through oversight,

00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:04.982
through bias,
and through outright exclusion.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.481
Here's the opportunity,

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.441
when we bring people with disability
into tech as designers,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.726
developers, product managers,
and leaders,

00:22:14.806 --> 00:22:17.021
they bring invaluable perspective.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.205
They understand accessibility not
as a compliance checkbox,

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.701
but as a fundamental design principle.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.181
They catch issues that others miss.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.370
They advocate for inclusive features
from the beginning

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.870
of the development process,

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.581
not as an afterthought.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.491
Beyond the practical benefits,
representation matters for its own sake.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.839
When a young person with a disability
sees someone like them succeeding in tech,

00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:47.770
it expands their sense of what's possible.

00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:52.031
It challenges stereotypes,
it changes narratives,

00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:54.670
it inspires the next generation.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.731
Finally, we build empowered communities.

00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:04.420
When individuals gain
skills and confidence,

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.431
they often turn around and lift up those
in their networks,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.261
creating a powerful ripple effect
that strengthens social cohesion

00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:17.831
and spreads a culture of inclusion.

00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.611
One of the most beautiful things
I've observed in our program

00:23:22.612 --> 00:23:27.370
is how quickly participants
go from being learners to teachers.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.969
Someone who struggled
with their concept three weeks

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.051
ago is now helping
a newer participant understand it.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.290
Someone who landed
their first freelance client

00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:43.390
is now sharing advice with others
on how to find opportunities.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.751
Someone who built
their first accessible website

00:23:46.991 --> 00:23:50.321
is now advocating for accessibility
in their community.

00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:56.362
This is how movements grow,
not through top-down mandates,

00:23:56.452 --> 00:24:01.751
but through grassroots empowerment
where each person actually succeeds,

00:24:02.021 --> 00:24:04.900
reaches back to help
the next person climb up.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.500
This creates sustainable change
that doesn't depend

00:24:08.501 --> 00:24:11.650
on any single organization or initiative,

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:16.780
but becomes woven
into the fabric of the community itself.

00:24:18.371 --> 00:24:22.481
So, the problem is clear
and the potential is huge,

00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:24.791
but how do we bridge that gap?

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.010
This is where open source comes in.

00:24:27.431 --> 00:24:32.589
I firmly believe that open source
democratizes access to technology

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.121
and learning opportunities.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.571
Tools like WordPress are perfect examples.

00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:41.650
WordPress is open source,
meaning it's free to use,

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.660
modify and distribute.

00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:48.460
This removes the financial barrier
to entry that proprietary software

00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:49.581
often creates.

00:24:49.582 --> 00:24:54.460
It has a massive global community
dedicated to its development and support,

00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:00.429
including a very active accessibility team
committing to making the platform usable

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.430
for everyone.

00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:08.860
This belief in the power of open source
and community led

00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:10.367
to the creation of TechAble.

00:25:10.757 --> 00:25:16.450
TechAble is an initiative that aims
to bridge the technological gap for people

00:25:16.451 --> 00:25:17.651
with disabilities.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.155
Our mission is to enhance employability,
promote inclusivity

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:26.920
in the digital economy by providing
accessible digital skills training

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.561
in web development using WordPress.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.690
We set out to create a program
that didn't just teach technical skills,

00:25:34.931 --> 00:25:38.530
but also address
the other barriers we identified.

00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:43.060
We wanted to build a supportive,
inclusive environment where people

00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:44.351
could not only learn,

00:25:44.621 --> 00:25:48.281
but also thrive and feel
a true sense of belonging.

00:25:50.561 --> 00:25:53.865
A crucial component
of the TechAble mission

00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:57.310
is a specific focus on gender inclusion.

00:25:57.821 --> 00:26:03.610
Statistics often show that women,
and particularly women with disabilities,

00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:07.180
face a double barrier
to entry in the tech sector.

00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:10.300
We are actively working
to change that narrative.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.156
Let me provide some context
for why this focus is so important.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.970
Women are already underrepresented
in tech globally,

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.760
typically comprising only about 25%
to 30% of the tech workforce.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.300
Women with disabilities
face even steeper odds,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.860
dealing with both gender discrimination
and disability discrimination,

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.061
what researchers
call intersectional disadvantage.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.020
Studies have shown that women
with disabilities experience

00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:47.259
lower employment rates than both men
with disabilities and women

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.651
without disabilities,
higher rates of poverty,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.331
less access to education,
more significant wage gaps,

00:26:55.601 --> 00:26:57.911
greater barriers to career advancement.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:03.280
We decided that addressing
this intersectional challenge would be

00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:06.331
a core focus of TechAble,
not an afterthought.

00:27:06.621 --> 00:27:11.051
I am proud to share
that 56% of our participants are women.

00:27:11.411 --> 00:27:13.960
This demonstrates
our commitment to providing

00:27:15.011 --> 00:27:18.700
an equitable environment
where everyone has a chance to thrive.

00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:21.982
We didn't achieve
this percentage by accident.

00:27:22.211 --> 00:27:26.621
It required intentional outreach,
creating a supportive environment,

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.980
addressing specific barriers
and being thoughtful

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.631
about the program design.

00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:40.359
Our program's overarching goal is
that it empowers women to shape

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.310
accessible digital futures.

00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:48.670
When we invest in them, we not only change
individual lives but also ensure

00:27:48.671 --> 00:27:51.854
that the future generation
of digital products

00:27:51.884 --> 00:27:56.051
and services is designed
with a wider, more inclusive lens.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.381
The women in our program
are not just learning to code,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.980
they are learning to lead.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.360
They are becoming
the next generation of tech entrepreneurs,

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.630
accessibility advocates
and community builders,

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.650
and that's going to change
the face of tech in Ghana and beyond.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:18.520
A core component of TechAble's success
is our approach to mentorship.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.961
We knew that just providing
lessons wouldn't be enough.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.776
We needed to address the issue
of limited community support head-on.

00:28:28.126 --> 00:28:32.381
Our mentorship program
provides personalized guidance.

00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:35.771
Each participant is paired
with experienced mentors

00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:39.611
from the tech industry
who can provide one-on-one support,

00:28:39.764 --> 00:28:43.120
answer technical questions
and offer career advice.

00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:46.271
It fosters peer support.

00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:51.550
We built a community where participants
can learn from and support each other.

00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:53.620
They work on projects together,

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.091
share their challenges and successes
and build lasting friendships.

00:28:58.451 --> 00:29:03.430
This peer network is often just
as valuable as the formal training itself,

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.021
and crucially,

00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:09.010
it helps participants build
valuable industry networks.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.370
Our mentors open doors
for our participants,

00:29:12.611 --> 00:29:16.270
connecting them to people
and opportunities they might not

00:29:16.271 --> 00:29:17.680
otherwise have access to.

00:29:18.221 --> 00:29:22.420
This helps to break down
the professional barriers that can be just

00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:24.611
as challenging as the technical ones.

00:29:28.181 --> 00:29:29.711
What has the impact been?

00:29:30.071 --> 00:29:31.481
It has been profound,

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.471
both for the individuals
and for the community as a whole.

00:29:35.741 --> 00:29:37.001
First and foremost,

00:29:37.181 --> 00:29:40.331
participants built
their first accessible websites.

00:29:40.601 --> 00:29:44.290
They went from having little
or no web development experience

00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:47.260
to creating fully functional,
professional,

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.620
and most importantly, accessible websites.

00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:53.440
This is a huge technical achievement.

00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:57.341
Perhaps even more important
is the human impact.

00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:02.681
We saw participants gain the confidence
to pursue freelance and digital jobs.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.394
They started to see
themselves as professionals,

00:30:05.701 --> 00:30:07.920
as people with valuable skills to offer.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.070
That shift in mindset is life-changing.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.059
Finally, we fostered
a stronger sense of community

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.060
and inclusion.

00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:20.521
Participants told us they finally felt
they belong in the tech world.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.590
They found a network of peers and mentors
who understood them and supported them.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.250
This sense of belonging is
the foundation upon

00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:31.471
which long-term success is built.

00:30:34.411 --> 00:30:39.781
No initiative succeeds without challenges
and no team grows without learning

00:30:39.811 --> 00:30:40.860
from mistakes.

00:30:42.151 --> 00:30:45.630
One first major lesson
was that accessibility

00:30:45.631 --> 00:30:49.531
is not something you achieve once
and check off your list.

00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:53.251
It's an ongoing commitment
that requires constant attention,

00:30:53.611 --> 00:30:55.350
learning, and improvement.

00:30:58.921 --> 00:31:03.391
Our second major lesson was
about the diversity of disabilities

00:31:03.451 --> 00:31:04.740
and learning styles.

00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:09.061
Different disabilities require
different accommodations.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.989
What works for deaf participants
doesn't necessarily work

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.581
for a blind participant.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.080
Beyond disability categories,
people are individuals

00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:25.174
with different learning paces,
different prior knowledge

00:31:25.254 --> 00:31:26.800
and different goals.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:36.511
Lesson 3, soft skills
matter as much as technical ones.

00:31:36.931 --> 00:31:39.840
Technical skills are necessary
but not sufficient.

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:44.311
Many of our graduates struggle not
because they couldn't build good websites

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.101
but because they didn't know
how to find clients,

00:31:47.461 --> 00:31:48.841
communicate professionally,

00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:52.471
price their services, manage
projects or market themselves.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.140
Lesson 4,
perhaps our most important lesson,

00:31:58.411 --> 00:32:02.551
has been about the psychological
and emotional dimensions of this work.

00:32:03.511 --> 00:32:07.321
Many of our participants entered
the program carrying years of rejection,

00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:11.850
low expectations from others
and internalized ableism.

00:32:12.351 --> 00:32:18.514
They've been told explicitly or implicitly
that they can't succeed in tech.

00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:21.361
Some have been discouraged
by family members

00:32:21.751 --> 00:32:26.971
out of misguided protectiveness try
to steer them toward more realistic goals.

00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:33.241
Technical training alone doesn't overcome
years of being told you're not capable.

00:32:33.361 --> 00:32:36.210
We learned that we needed
to intentionally address

00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:39.990
the psychological barriers alongside
the technical ones.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.801
Lesson 5, partnership and collaboration

00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:48.721
amplify impact.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.420
We've learned that collaboration,
not competition,

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.551
is how social impact works best.

00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:03.930
When organizations working
towards similar goals support each other,

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.521
everyone wins,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.969
especially
the people we are all trying to serve.

00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:13.801
We've covered a lot of ground
in this presentation.

00:33:14.221 --> 00:33:17.250
Now I want to talk
about the most important part,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.951
what you can do
to help advance this mission.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.650
There are actions you can take right now

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.160
regardless of your role or resources.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.170
Let me suggest several ways you can.

00:33:29.221 --> 00:33:33.120
For developers and designers,
learn accessibility standards.

00:33:33.451 --> 00:33:36.451
There are
excellent free resources available online.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.361
If you have
accessibility expertise, share it.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.390
Mentor someone who is learning.

00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:48.090
For employers and business leaders,
don't just say you value diversity.

00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:50.130
Demonstrate it through action.

00:33:50.491 --> 00:33:53.071
Actively recruit people with disabilities.

00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:59.880
For educators and trainers,
make your content accessible.

00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:02.371
Use accessible documents formats.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.581
Test your learning platforms
with assistive technology.

00:34:08.491 --> 00:34:10.860
For funders and philanthropists,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.661
support programs that are doing
the hard work of creating opportunity.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.501
Accessible training programs
need financial support to scale.

00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:25.561
For advocates and allies, learn
about accessibility and disability rights.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.320
Read blogs by people with disabilities.

00:34:28.891 --> 00:34:31.534
Speak up when you encounter
inaccessible products

00:34:31.535 --> 00:34:33.480
or discriminatory practices.

00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:36.960
Support disability-led organizations.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.300
For people with disabilities,

00:34:40.201 --> 00:34:41.201
know your worth.

00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:45.211
You have valuable skills,
perspectives and contributions to offer.

00:34:45.571 --> 00:34:50.640
The barriers you face are not your fault
and they do not reflect your abilities.

00:34:51.031 --> 00:34:53.490
Connect with other people
with disabilities.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.850
Share resources, challenges and successes.

00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:58.920
There is power in community.

00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:01.561
Advocate for yourself.

00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:06.481
Learn to articulate your needs
and advocate for accommodations.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.840
Consider mentoring.

00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:15.061
Once you have the skills and experience,
consider paying it forward.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.601
I'll leave you
with one specific challenge.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.940
In the next week, take one concrete action
to advance digital accessibility.

00:35:24.421 --> 00:35:28.861
It could be adding proper access
to images on your website,

00:35:29.161 --> 00:35:31.950
learning one new thing
about web accessibility,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.820
making a donation
to an accessibility-focused organization,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.411
committing to making accessibility
a priority in your next project.

00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:41.970
Just one action,

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.170
small steps, taken by many people,
creates movement.

00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.031
Thank you for your time and attention.

00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:54.000
Thank you for caring about this issue.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.060
Thank you for whatever action
you choose to take,

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.827
whether large or small,
to advance accessibility.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.591
I hope this discussion
has not only informed you,

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:09.510
but also inspired you to think
about how you too can contribute

00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:11.821
to a more accessible digital future.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.004
The work continues,
the community grows,

00:36:15.184 --> 00:36:19.501
the impact expands and we invite you to be
a part of it.

00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:22.261
I am happy to take
any questions you may have.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.820
Thank you once again.

00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:27.361
Let's build
an accessible digital future together.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:35.679
Chris Hinds: Thank you very much, Samuel,
for that wonderful presentation.

00:36:35.919 --> 00:36:38.500
Just a reminder to our audience,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.639
you can enter questions
in the Q&A section anytime,

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:46.780
and we would love to take
any additional questions you have.

00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:53.139
Samuel was kind enough to share
some answers in writing,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.169
but I do want to run
through a couple of these questions,

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.679
Samuel, that you've already answered
and just give people the opportunity

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:01.629
to hear you speak to them a little bit.

00:37:03.009 --> 00:37:04.299
First and foremost,

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.640
one question that I would love
to hear you expand on and just share is,

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:13.449
could you just share more about overcoming
challenges and surpassing barriers

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.889
like a lack of government support
at TechAble as you were working

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:18.890
on that program?

00:37:20.741 --> 00:37:22.591
Samuel Osei: As you mentioned,

00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:26.979
there were several challenges
that we had to face.

00:37:28.419 --> 00:37:31.299
When there was no government support,
we had to rely on funding

00:37:31.299 --> 00:37:33.939
from IEEE Computer Society.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.860
That was like the initial funds we had
to get started with TechAble.

00:37:39.419 --> 00:37:41.631
We also partnered with KNUST,

00:37:41.632 --> 00:37:43.612
which is the Kwame Nkrumah University
of Science

00:37:43.612 --> 00:37:44.612
and Technology.

00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:48.989
There's a Student
with Disability Association there.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.129
We partnered with their patron.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:55.474
Also, one part of it was getting
their volunteers.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.258
It was really hard trying
to convince everyone,

00:37:59.259 --> 00:38:04.588
but they all made it a success
and it was a really great outcome.

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:12.820
Chris: One thing Taco asked,
who's one of our tech coordinators,

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.163
was what's something that TechAble
needs most to expand further

00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:18.364
and to help more people?

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.099
You had mentioned funding

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.710
and I want to expand
on Taco's question a little bit.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.821
What's the best way for people
to inquire about providing

00:38:29.822 --> 00:38:32.046
that funding
or who would they reach out to

00:38:32.122 --> 00:38:33.429
or how would they get in touch

00:38:33.429 --> 00:38:36.530
to be able to support the program
more if they were interested?

00:38:36.903 --> 00:38:39.939
Samuel: At the moment,
the channels to reach out,

00:38:40.509 --> 00:38:43.090
it's via the email I shared earlier.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.380
As I say,

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:50.738
at IEEE.org, we are making systems
in place for proper channels

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:53.140
and proper documentation of everything.

00:38:53.304 --> 00:38:56.139
As of now,
it's the email I shared earlier.

00:38:57.009 --> 00:38:58.409
With respect to the funding,

00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:01.542
one challenge we had was many
of the participants

00:39:01.563 --> 00:39:05.808
don't own laptops or internet
is really expensive in Ghana

00:39:05.908 --> 00:39:08.902
and like the part of the world we live.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.448
Most of the funding goes to these,
acquiring these personal devices

00:39:13.449 --> 00:39:14.874
and like accessibility too.

00:39:15.384 --> 00:39:16.742
Most of the time,

00:39:16.743 --> 00:39:19.630
another challenge has to do
with the buildings,

00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:22.570
the places that they're going
to have the events.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.562
Not every building
over here is accessible.

00:39:26.773 --> 00:39:30.758
We have to have
a very friendly environment

00:39:30.759 --> 00:39:35.770
where participants can come
in and it's also close to their residence.

00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:38.140
They don't have to commute
for longer distance.

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:42.759
It's really important to have
the funding to be able to acquire

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.710
these new devices.

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.880
As I mentioned,
it's still in its early stages.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.143
We will be putting
proper measures in place.

00:39:51.203 --> 00:39:54.283
Our website
will also be live very shortly.

00:39:54.383 --> 00:39:58.867
We started off based on an IEEE concept.

00:39:58.902 --> 00:40:01.319
We are taking it higher and scaling it.

00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:03.421
Chris: That's so amazing.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.409
Amy asked,

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:11.949
is there more you'd like to say or share
about the particular experiences of women

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:15.939
in connecting with and staying
in the program?

00:40:17.202 --> 00:40:21.565
Samuel: For the women we had,
one important thing we did

00:40:21.566 --> 00:40:26.752
was trying to make them
have like peer buddies.

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:29.829
We group them in pairs
and they check up on each other.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.729
If one is coming for a meeting,
they reach out to see

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.880
if the other is coming.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.820
Like sort of an accountability buddy.

00:40:37.441 --> 00:40:38.441
We did that.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:45.518
Another example, another instance
was how we make sure women are giving

00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:46.660
more attention, more care,

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.879
because realize some women

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.309
don't really trust in themselves.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.719
They need an extra push,
some extra support to guide them

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.760
in that process.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.760
We made sure that we had volunteers
or the assistants at their disposal.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.019
We paid more attention to them
and we made them

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.690
also like take charge of activities.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:18.879
An example would be leading a session
or taking control of a particular,

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.459
let's say, tasks,

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:27.224
like trying to put them at places
where they can shine and gain confidence.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.410
Chris: Wonderful.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.518
I have my own question
that may or may not get added

00:41:33.519 --> 00:41:35.227
to the official Q&A log.

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:37.449
I was curious

00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:41.919
if you could list out or provide
a more detailed view of what

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.369
kind of digital services or expertise
that TechAble participants

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.370
were trained in?

00:41:46.689 --> 00:41:49.510
Is there a way for companies
who might need help to reach out

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.810
and potentially hire them?

00:41:51.601 --> 00:41:56.320
Samuel: The digital services expertise,
so before we started,

00:41:56.354 --> 00:42:02.200
we did a brief analysis
on what we can teach in that scheme.

00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:04.665
We currently run three programs.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:10.509
Like web developments using WordPress,
we do digital marketing

00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:11.920
and then graphic design.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.620
These three are the lines we have.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:20.700
We believe these skills
are really essential and with training,

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:25.480
the participants to be able
to have easy work to do

00:42:25.531 --> 00:42:28.250
and also try to earn their living.

00:42:28.334 --> 00:42:32.439
The whole goal is to empower
these people, especially in Ghana,

00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:38.038
most people with disabilities
don't have relatively high incomes.

00:42:38.039 --> 00:42:42.313
We are trying to let them
be prepared for remote opportunities.

00:42:42.462 --> 00:42:49.037
That was our guided direction
for choosing the programs we run.

00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:55.364
A way for companies
to potentially hire them.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.898
We started off connecting them
with companies,

00:42:58.899 --> 00:42:59.726
local companies.

00:42:59.727 --> 00:43:02.140
Mostly they work remotely
from their homes.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.389
It's mostly online work.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.350
So one is more like trying to reconnect

00:43:11.866 --> 00:43:15.070
the participants with employers.

00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:16.789
We believe

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.650
we should take on the hard work of looking
for opportunities for them.

00:43:20.979 --> 00:43:24.931
Some participants are still [?]
and additional training

00:43:24.932 --> 00:43:28.260
from some of our partner companies.

00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:29.440
An example would be

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:33.309
the cloud practitioner training.

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:36.730
We put them on such training
with our partner company.

00:43:37.059 --> 00:43:42.129
What we do is just everything routes
through the organizing committee.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.780
Then we distribute to our participants
who have interest.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.929
Some just basically want to have
the skills for their personal use.

00:43:50.124 --> 00:43:53.228
Some want to also like
start off with something.

00:43:53.229 --> 00:43:55.679
They know they can do
something increasingly well.

00:43:56.039 --> 00:43:58.913
With that, they have
the confidence to advance that.

00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:01.630
Chris: That's great.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.230
Thank you so much for sharing all of that.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:10.229
Another question we have here is
a lot of WordPress's potential

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.749
is tied up in these commercial products
that you have to buy licenses for,

00:44:13.749 --> 00:44:15.609
and that can get quite expensive.

00:44:16.089 --> 00:44:19.330
Another question that we have here
is could product companies

00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:24.579
find a way to donate paid
licenses of their WordPress products

00:44:24.699 --> 00:44:26.449
to TechAble?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.850
How would we do that?

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.929
Samuel: Yeah, I think
that would be really awesome

00:44:31.959 --> 00:44:33.879
because as I mentioned,

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:39.039
living in Ghana, the currency
is already much higher compared to the US.

00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:43.979
You have to spend much more money
to afford basic plugins

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:46.059
and other commercial products.

00:44:46.299 --> 00:44:52.838
One, that would be an amazing opportunity
and we would be more than happy

00:44:52.839 --> 00:44:54.190
to have that.

00:44:55.499 --> 00:44:59.152
The other part of the question has
to do with the channel of doing that.

00:44:59.254 --> 00:45:03.668
At the moment, I mentioned earlier
our websites and I did say everything

00:45:03.669 --> 00:45:04.720
is in the pipeline.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.432
We just finished of [?]
the pilot space with IEEE.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.989
Very soon everything will be together.

00:45:11.019 --> 00:45:12.220
But now at the moment,

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:17.601
you can reach out by the email,
the SSA at IEEE.org.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:23.438
Once we go live, our websites are going
to provide all correspondence to that.

00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:25.660
That's my answer for the question.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.768
Chris: Taco asked,
in addition to the question

00:45:32.769 --> 00:45:36.670
about licenses, is there an opportunity
to do a remote training session

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.660
to help TechAble members learn
popular plugins more deeply?

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.690
Samuel: Yes, that would be really,
really awesome.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:48.030
The program we ran at KNUST,
for instance,

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.770
we had [?] for mentors.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.610
[?] they are called mentors
and some of their trainings are online.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:46:00.439
We welcome any opportunity,
any avenue for us to improve

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.310
the skill sets of our participants.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.040
Let's get talking.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:10.809
We are going to put structures in place,
trying to find a place

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.795
where all the participants
can get together.

00:46:12.795 --> 00:46:15.145
Another challenge had
to do with infrastructure.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:19.398
Network is quite an issue in Ghana
and other developing countries.

00:46:20.107 --> 00:46:24.340
We try to assemble all the participants
in a place where they have access

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.919
to fast Wi-Fi and internet connection.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.070
We can sort of have a large screen
where everyone can tune in

00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:32.991
and then have a session.

00:46:32.992 --> 00:46:34.923
It's something that
we can explore

00:46:34.943 --> 00:46:37.190
and we can make accommodations for that.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120
Chris: Wonderful.

00:46:39.139 --> 00:46:41.030
It seems like Taco
has volunteered me to do

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.030
a remote accessibility training session.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.309
I will commit to doing that.

00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:51.069
If you want to send me a note afterwards,
or I actually connected with you on X,

00:46:51.169 --> 00:46:53.769
you can send me a DM
and we can coordinate something.

00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:58.769
Samuel: Awesome.
Chris: I'm out of questions in the Q&A.

00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:00.859
Does anyone have any final questions?

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.979
I think we have like a minute left or so.

00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:07.559
If anyone has any,
they'd like to drop in the chat?

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.049
Any questions?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
All right.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.659
Well, in that case,

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.879
if there are no more questions,

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.399
then I will thank

00:47:29.119 --> 00:47:31.789
everyone for attending
this session with Samuel Osei.

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:32.790
It was amazing.

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:36.469
You can continue the conversation
in the chat or on social media

00:47:36.489 --> 00:47:43.257

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:49.640
