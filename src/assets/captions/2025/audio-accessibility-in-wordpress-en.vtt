>> BERND SCHMITT: Hello,

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:07.934
my name is Bernd Schmitt,
and I welcome you

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:14.083
to the WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:20.595
We are talking here
about audio accessibility in WordPress.

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:24.374
The level is for beginners.

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:29.205
What's the content?

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:36.555
The audio content on WordPress websites
and on any other kind of website

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.615
is growing.

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:43.514
Websites with audio content,
podcasts, music

00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:47.625
should be accessible and comprehensible
for all people.

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:53.385
This talk is about creating
accessible audio content

00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:56.475
with mostly open-source tools

00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:00.885
and how to place it
the best way in WordPress.

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:08.145
We are talking much
about audio quality, about transcripts,

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:10.686
and a little bit about sound control.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.437
I have to do this.

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:20.685
Some words about myself.

00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:23.743
My name is Bernd Schmitt.

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.124
I am from Germany.

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:30.553
I am a DJ
and a little bit of audio producer.

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:32.295
I try to make some hits.

00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:36.734
Maybe sometimes I have success with it.

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:40.311
Of course, I am a WordPress enthusiast.

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:42.494
I'm not a developer.

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:48.224
I'm just a heavy WordPress user
for banned websites,

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:50.445
for every kind of websites.

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:53.174
I like WordPress very much.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:58.915
Some basics.

00:04:00.884 --> 00:04:02.055
An audio file

00:04:03.164 --> 00:04:04.305
and a video file

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:10.184
should never be played by default
when a visitor is entering a page.

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:11.415
Don't do that.

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:16.665
The visitor should be able to click
the play button to start the audio file.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:24.294
Don't do it by default
because when you have native audio

00:04:24.405 --> 00:04:25.405
on the page,

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.814
which is starting by default,
this will interfere

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:30.974
with screen reader audio.

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:34.034
We have two types of audio:
the screen reader audio

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:36.495
and the native audio.

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.535
Don't make things so complicated.

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.224
Just say

00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:43.425
the visitor should click the play button.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.825
Some other basics.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:58.736
There is the WAI,
the Web Accessibility Initiative.

00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:03.795
They say make audio
and video media accessible.

00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:09.765
Accessible audio and other media
is essential for people with disabilities,

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:13.695
but not only for people with disabilities.

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:15.884
It's useful for everyone.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:21.344
Accessibility features are also used
by people without disabilities.

00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:22.975
For example,

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:26.295
you have situations
in a noisy background, for example,

00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:30.165
at the airport or on the railway station.

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:33.164
Then it's fine to have

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:35.263
good audio quality.

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:38.205
Or you are learning a new language.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.505
Good to have
a good audio quality.

00:05:45.974 --> 00:05:47.475
What is this talk about?

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:54.314
It's about producing good-quality
for audio content for WordPress websites.

00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:57.134
It's doing it the native way.

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:01.814
The focus is on audio production
and implementation in WordPress.

00:06:02.774 --> 00:06:05.024
What you see on the right side

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.805
is a screenshot of a website,

00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:12.974
my website, SoundKlapp,
with an overlay solution.

00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:16.575
Overlay solution is really a fine thing.

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:21.344
This overlay is a fine tool
with many accessibility functions

00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:23.535
and great audio functions.

00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:25.633
With the Read Aloud tool,

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:27.314
you can choose the language.

00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:31.485
Both things are helpful for accessibility.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:35.235
Native solutions and overlay solutions.

00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:37.155
We here

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:38.665
in my talk,

00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:42.544
we start with the basics of native things,

00:06:42.984 --> 00:06:46.844
with the basics
of good quality audio production.

00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:56.475
I have a little overview for my talk.

00:06:57.735 --> 00:07:01.995
We start with record high-quality audio.

00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:04.845
This is the first step.

00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:09.765
It's the most important step
to have good quality by recording.

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:13.064
Then we have edit and enhance audio.

00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:15.195
This is called post-production.

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:20.204
Then we have create
transcript from the audio,

00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:22.164
captions

00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:25.815
if you do it with YouTube.

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:31.244
Then we want to embed it
in our WordPress websites.

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:34.665
It's fine to have some download options.

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:37.154
In the last step,

00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:40.215
we want to test the accessibility.

00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:44.835
Start with recording high-quality audio.

00:07:50.264 --> 00:07:52.845
What is important to start

00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:55.004
high-quality audio?

00:07:57.734 --> 00:07:58.734
The basics.

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:04.785
When you are doing
audio production or when you do

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:08.264
programming, you should know

00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:13.454
the GIGO principle.

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:16.214
Garbage in, garbage out.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:23.264
Or GIGO suggests that bad input
will always produce bad output.

00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:28.155
It has been around since
the early days of computing

00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:29.984
and refers to the fact

00:08:30.494 --> 00:08:35.204
that if you input bad data
or bad audio quality,

00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:38.084
it will produce bad output.

00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:39.354
Keep in mind,

00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:45.105
with a bad audio recording,
you will have a bad audio output,

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:48.315
even in times of artificial intelligence.

00:08:49.185 --> 00:08:51.344
What do you need
for a good audio recording?

00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:52.542
Three things.

00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:53.994
The room.

00:08:54.224 --> 00:09:00.464
For optimal audio recording, you need
a medium to large rectangular

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:04.619
or asymmetrical room with a minimum echo.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:09.765
You don't have to rent
a room or things like this.

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:11.274
Let's say

00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:16.544
if it is a room which is
a little bit messy,

00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:20.085
put some things in it,
and it's not too small,

00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:21.145
then it's fine.

00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:23.115
Then you have a speaker.

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:26.204
Now I'm talking to myself too.

00:09:26.474 --> 00:09:27.735
You speak slow,

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:29.934
clear,

00:09:30.224 --> 00:09:32.115
and have pauses.

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.905
I try to do this now for me.

00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:37.994
Then you have to record it.

00:09:40.295 --> 00:09:45.005
I think it's a good idea to use
these handheld digital recorders

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:46.354
for audio production,

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:47.595
not for our talk,

00:09:48.874 --> 00:09:53.885
because they are able to record voice
or acoustic music in the moment.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:56.165
These handheld recorders are fine.

00:09:56.435 --> 00:09:57.435
They are cheap.

00:09:58.284 --> 00:10:01.224
I think about $100.

00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:03.935
They are not too expensive
and easy to use.

00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:06.484
Put in the batteries and click record.

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:09.695
It's fine, and you have
a good quality with this.

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.905
Now I come to the details.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:15.825
The room.

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:16.934
What you see

00:10:17.164 --> 00:10:20.765
in the screen in the picture
is my personal recording room

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:22.275
for my band.

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:27.093
You don't want to spend
money for a recording studio.

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:28.094
No problem.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:31.084
Let's practice home recording
with a little know-how.

00:10:31.084 --> 00:10:34.564
You can record a great sound
in your bedroom or in your living room.

00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:40.174
Be sure to record in a room
that is isolated from all external sounds,

00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:44.135
but don't try it in the bathroom.

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:48.814
In the bathroom, you would get
too much unwanted echo

00:10:48.994 --> 00:10:50.014
on your recording.

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:55.594
For us, it's important to avoid echo
and reverberation.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:11:01.835
Use carpets, curtains, furniture
to avoid sound reflections.

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:07.685
Smooth surfaces and glass reflect sounds.

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.039
This is bad.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.275
Don't record in an empty room or in a room
with too much smooth surfaces.

00:11:17.105 --> 00:11:18.634
This was the room.

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:21.934
Next, the speaker.

00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.805
You don't have to be
a professional speaker.

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:27.215
With a little know-how,

00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:29.645
you can do the things right.

00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:31.624
Speak clearly.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.694
This is important for people
wanting to understand the content

00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:38.795
and for captioners, too.

00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:40.985
Speak slowly.

00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:46.803
This will enable listeners
to understand better and make the timing

00:11:46.804 --> 00:11:49.355
better for captions and sign language.

00:11:51.154 --> 00:11:52.925
Pause between topics.

00:11:53.344 --> 00:11:56.165
This is important for post-production.

00:11:57.395 --> 00:11:58.445
Don't confuse.

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:02.764
Avoid to explain jargon, acronyms,

00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:03.994
and idioms.

00:12:04.414 --> 00:12:07.055
If you do it, you have to explain

00:12:07.624 --> 00:12:08.624
acronyms

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:10.504
and these things.

00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:17.854
Number three, the hardware.

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:23.795
You don't have to buy
professional audio hardware.

00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:26.165
Just buy what you really need.

00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:30.514
You don't have to use
a high-end microphone

00:12:30.515 --> 00:12:32.674
and expensive recording software.

00:12:32.764 --> 00:12:33.764
The problem is,

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:35.385
if you are not

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:41.553
an audio engineer, you can make
a lot of mistakes with high-end equipment.

00:12:41.554 --> 00:12:44.524
You can have many options then.

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:48.274
I am a semi-professional audio producer.

00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:51.423
I can tell you, I bought
professional equipment.

00:12:51.424 --> 00:12:53.114
You must know how to use this.

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:54.555
Otherwise,

00:12:54.724 --> 00:12:58.805
it's better to buy
not-so-professional equipment.

00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:02.734
You don't need
an expensive audio interface.

00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:07.984
Don't use
the built-in microphone of a notebook.

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.174
The quality is too poor.

00:13:10.925 --> 00:13:11.925
What do you need?

00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:17.105
An external microphone, not too expensive.

00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:20.554
Or what I use is a handheld recorder.

00:13:21.215 --> 00:13:22.565
If you look on the picture,

00:13:23.225 --> 00:13:25.804
this recorder has a display.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.739
On the display, you see the signal.

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:33.184
It's easy to use; you connect it
with the cable to the computer.

00:13:36.604 --> 00:13:43.955
I think it's a good solution
to come very fast to a start of recording.

00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:49.564
My first USB cable was not working.

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:53.555
If you have the same problem,
buy another USB cable.

00:13:54.095 --> 00:13:58.675
It was my cable I've used
with my mobile.

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:07.902
Don't buy too much expensive things.

00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:11.044
We are talking
about good enough recording.

00:14:14.944 --> 00:14:19.055
This was about recording
high-quality audio,

00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:22.444
or let's say recording
good enough quality audio.

00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:27.815
Now we come to the next step: edit
and enhance your audio recording.

00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:37.054
There's one app, I would say,
download it and use it.

00:14:37.055 --> 00:14:38.515
It's called Audacity.

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:41.074
After the recording,

00:14:41.585 --> 00:14:43.805
you start editing your audio file.

00:14:44.575 --> 00:14:46.985
Audacity is a very popular, free,

00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:48.934
and open-source tool.

00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:50.014
It's a good tool.

00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:55.654
It runs on all major operating systems:
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

00:14:56.454 --> 00:15:01.455
Please download it
from the official site, audacityteam.org.

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:04.834
Maybe there are some other sites,
but this is the official site.

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:09.844
Then you export your audio file
from your handheld recorder

00:15:09.845 --> 00:15:15.724
or from any other source
and import it to Audacity for editing

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:17.524
and post-production.

00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:24.034
With Audacity, you can do a lot of things.

00:15:24.034 --> 00:15:29.104
You can use two, three,
or more tracks parallel and put

00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:31.114
background music to audio.

00:15:31.595 --> 00:15:36.935
This can cause problems,
background music or background noises.

00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:43.445
When the main audio is a person
speaking and you have background music,

00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:48.964
set the level so that people
with hearing or cognitive disability

00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:53.495
can easily distinguish
the speaking from the background.

00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:57.094
Don't make
these background noises too loud,

00:15:57.124 --> 00:16:00.304
or don't use background noises.

00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:07.083
Make the background sounds
at least 20 decibels lower

00:16:07.084 --> 00:16:08.645
than a foreground speech

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.662
and with the exception
of occasional sounds

00:16:12.663 --> 00:16:15.034
that last for only one or two seconds.

00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:19.894
Avoid sounds that can be distracting
or irritating,

00:16:20.254 --> 00:16:23.434
such as high pitches
and repeating patterns

00:16:25.164 --> 00:16:26.194
to the pitches.

00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:28.444
We come now

00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:31.114
on the next slides.

00:16:34.624 --> 00:16:37.474
Let's talk about levels and loudness.

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:39.875
For demonstration,

00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:44.704
we use Audacity,
but not a handheld recorder,

00:16:45.185 --> 00:16:47.555
and this is better for making screenshots.

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:52.983
You can use Audacity
as a recording tool, too.

00:16:52.984 --> 00:16:56.045
If you don't want to use
a handheld recorder,

00:16:56.524 --> 00:17:00.814
put a microphone in your laptop,
X10 microphone,

00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:05.105
and make recordings
with Audacity.

00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:11.075
Now, what's the problem
by doing some recordings?

00:17:13.764 --> 00:17:14.764
The level.

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:19.925
When you see here this signal,
it's far too low.

00:17:19.984 --> 00:17:24.903
This track is not loud enough
and not good for understanding,

00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:29.014
so you made some mistakes by recording.

00:17:30.545 --> 00:17:31.594
You can fix it.

00:17:31.864 --> 00:17:32.864
I'll show you.

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:41.135
If you take an effect
which is called normalize.

00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:46.625
Normalize means your signal is too low,
and we put it to a normal level.

00:17:47.674 --> 00:17:51.334
This effect will bring
your recording to a normal level.

00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:56.405
Then you have Audacity and there's
an effect sections and you click here

00:17:56.585 --> 00:18:00.365
to effect and then to normalize.

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:05.614
Then you can raise up
the level of your recording,

00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:07.295
but you have to decide.

00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:09.934
Is the level a bit too low?

00:18:10.534 --> 00:18:12.965
Then, normalization is a good idea.

00:18:14.014 --> 00:18:15.725
Is the level extreme low?

00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:22.295
Then try a new recording, but do it better
than you did in the last recording.

00:18:25.415 --> 00:18:26.674
In the new recording,

00:18:26.914 --> 00:18:31.144
speak louder or level up
the recording volume.

00:18:31.684 --> 00:18:35.945
You can do this, recording up
the volume in Audacity.

00:18:36.814 --> 00:18:39.184
I've shown you here in the screenshot.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:52.662
Here is recording volume 0.85,
and you can raise it up to 1.0.

00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:56.074
Then this will be louder,
and you don't have

00:18:56.075 --> 00:18:59.194
to use too much
of this normalize function.

00:19:05.254 --> 00:19:10.534
If you normalize,
you shouldn't go to 0 dB.

00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:15.635
Most audio engineers

00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:23.194
go to a maximum of -1.0 dB.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.095
This means the highest peak in the audio

00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:32.209
will be adjusted so
that it reaches -1.0 dB,

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.254
which is 1 decibel
below the point of clipping.

00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:36.784
Clipping is a bad thing.

00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:41.944
You will result in ugly noises,

00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:46.744
and it is not a good idea
to normalize to 0 dB.

00:19:46.745 --> 00:19:48.005
In some cases,

00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:54.035
particularly by converting the audio
from one file to another file format,

00:19:54.754 --> 00:20:00.934
from MP3 to another file format,
this will result in ugly noises.

00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:02.944
Normalization you do

00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:09.434
until -1.0 dB.

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:16.715
This picture shows
the effect of normalization.

00:20:16.835 --> 00:20:23.344
I did it with Audacity,
and you see a little problem.

00:20:25.055 --> 00:20:28.445
If you look at the peaks,
at the arrows, you see a problem.

00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:30.245
This peak is very loud,

00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:32.465
and if you do normalization,

00:20:34.714 --> 00:20:38.765
this very loud peak stops
the raising of the quieter parts.

00:20:39.184 --> 00:20:44.735
The amplitude of the quieter parts
and the track in total is not so loud

00:20:45.155 --> 00:20:49.234
as it could be
because of this single peak there.

00:20:52.984 --> 00:20:54.184
What can we do now?

00:20:55.204 --> 00:20:57.545
This is called compression.

00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:06.513
In the effect section of Audacity,
you find a tool which is called

00:21:06.514 --> 00:21:07.534
the compressor.

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:11.315
What does a compressor do?

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:15.724
A compressor controls
a signal's dynamic range

00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:20.830
by automatically reducing
the level of loud parts of peaks

00:21:21.023 --> 00:21:23.734
more than the level of quiet parts.

00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:26.885
A compressor gives a track more density.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:32.195
The quieter parts of the track
will then better to hear.

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:35.735
This is what a compressor does.

00:21:36.724 --> 00:21:37.894
The loud parts

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:41.914
are reduced heavier
than the quieter parts.

00:21:47.404 --> 00:21:48.404
If you want

00:21:48.935 --> 00:21:51.364
to hear this effect clearly,

00:21:53.074 --> 00:21:56.014
in the compressor, you have many options.

00:21:57.965 --> 00:21:59.673
You can control the threshold.

00:21:59.674 --> 00:22:03.635
It's the level at which the compressor
is active for the louder parts,

00:22:03.815 --> 00:22:04.815
the ratio,

00:22:05.105 --> 00:22:07.264
how much the signal is reduced,

00:22:08.524 --> 00:22:11.885
the attack time, how quickly it reacts,
and the release time.

00:22:12.004 --> 00:22:14.645
You must not learn all these things.

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:20.105
If you want to have a drastic effect,
draw the ratio slider up.

00:22:20.253 --> 00:22:23.860
Try it a little bit,
and try a heavier ratio

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.792
from 5 to 1,

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.662
and then you hear the effect clearly.

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.375
After the compression,

00:22:36.184 --> 00:22:37.184
you see this.

00:22:37.475 --> 00:22:37.835
Now,

00:22:38.374 --> 00:22:44.795
maybe you are a little bit disappointed
because you see

00:22:45.934 --> 00:22:47.764
the amplitude is not enough.

00:22:49.324 --> 00:22:52.835
Remember what a compressor does:
it reduces signals.

00:22:53.284 --> 00:22:57.545
You have to push up the signal
after the compression.

00:22:57.895 --> 00:22:58.895
I'll show you.

00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:07.354
Now I have done the normalization
after compression.

00:23:07.685 --> 00:23:08.685
Let's compare.

00:23:08.734 --> 00:23:09.875
On the left side,

00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:13.504
you have a track normalized,

00:23:14.854 --> 00:23:16.204
and on the right side,

00:23:16.655 --> 00:23:18.124
you have a track

00:23:18.755 --> 00:23:22.295
first compressed then normalized.

00:23:23.405 --> 00:23:27.695
The track on the right side
is more balanced between the quieter

00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.224
and the louder parts.

00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.285
The quieter parts are louder,

00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:37.714
and this is what people call
loudness in audio production.

00:23:38.344 --> 00:23:42.155
The track on the right side
has more loudness,

00:23:42.214 --> 00:23:46.204
and it's more balanced and easier to hear.

00:23:53.824 --> 00:23:58.384
Another important thing is the speed.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:03.874
Some people they talk very fast,
and then it is hard to understand.

00:24:04.624 --> 00:24:08.405
In Audacity, you have
the possibility to speak.

00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:14.194
First, what you can do to speak slower,

00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:17.404
relax a little bit,

00:24:17.794 --> 00:24:21.575
make a pause between phrases,
talk in bullets,

00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:26.525
use pauses between paragraphs,
and speak on the exhale.

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:31.054
How can you fix it
if your speaker has left the room?

00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:37.025
You have to fix it in Audacity
by changing the speed.

00:24:40.715 --> 00:24:41.795
You mark the track,

00:24:42.844 --> 00:24:47.619
you go to the effect sections,
and you click change speed.

00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:51.575
Then you have a slider

00:24:52.415 --> 00:24:54.515
to make this slower or faster.

00:24:54.544 --> 00:24:58.055
I think it's better to make it slower,
easier to understand.

00:24:58.895 --> 00:25:02.375
Here in the example,
the track is 10% slower.

00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:05.824
The new track is then a little bit longer.

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:13.420
If the track was 10 seconds
and you make it 10% slower,

00:25:13.684 --> 00:25:17.134
now the new track is 11 seconds long.

00:25:19.264 --> 00:25:21.664
Here you see it before the speed change.

00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:27.154
This track is about 3.5 seconds,
and after the speed change,

00:25:27.155 --> 00:25:30.484
it's 3.7 or like this.

00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:34.804
I've changed the speed,
and now it's easier to understand it.

00:25:37.534 --> 00:25:42.895
This was about recording and edit,
and enhance audio.

00:25:42.915 --> 00:25:45.754
Now we come to create a transcript.

00:25:48.635 --> 00:25:52.385
You can easily create
a transcript with Google Docs.

00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:54.933
What you need is the browser Chrome.

00:25:54.934 --> 00:25:56.824
It works out of the box,

00:25:57.484 --> 00:26:00.844
and you need a Google account
to use Google Docs.

00:26:02.364 --> 00:26:05.735
In Google Docs, you click on tools,

00:26:06.935 --> 00:26:11.345
and you click on this recording icon,
this recording microphone,

00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:13.024
and start recording.

00:26:15.394 --> 00:26:19.534
You can choose the language,
select the language,

00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:24.754
and then click on the microphone button,
and then talk in your selected language,

00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:26.914
and Google will write it down.

00:26:27.274 --> 00:26:28.654
It's very easy to use.

00:26:32.015 --> 00:26:34.385
The next is about captions.

00:26:35.254 --> 00:26:38.855
You can make a trick for captions

00:26:39.325 --> 00:26:41.644
if you use YouTube.

00:26:42.654 --> 00:26:45.274
If you have a Google account,
you can start a channel

00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:47.367
on YouTube to upload your own video.

00:26:48.277 --> 00:26:51.364
It is not necessary
to upload a moving picture.

00:26:51.904 --> 00:26:56.045
You can upload a static picture
and an audio file.

00:26:56.255 --> 00:27:00.754
This is enough to get this thing
with the caption done.

00:27:01.925 --> 00:27:05.817
This is the way it works fast
to get subtitles on an audio file.

00:27:06.994 --> 00:27:11.554
Take a free and easy to use
video editor like OpenShot,

00:27:12.484 --> 00:27:13.774
upload one picture

00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:23.074
and then upload your audio file
and create a video in a video editor.

00:27:24.395 --> 00:27:30.574
Then export this video for YouTube
and open the YouTube Studio.

00:27:31.864 --> 00:27:34.085
Now we are in the YouTube Studio,

00:27:34.984 --> 00:27:37.424
and I have uploaded here a video

00:27:46.745 --> 00:27:47.745
with a picture

00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:49.444
and an audio file.

00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:51.694
I've done it in the video editor.

00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:55.924
Now I want to have

00:27:57.184 --> 00:28:00.065
subtitles in this video.

00:28:02.075 --> 00:28:03.575
I've chosen a language,

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:12.605
and then I go to the to YouTube Studio
and say add subtitle.

00:28:16.324 --> 00:28:17.324
Now you see

00:28:17.915 --> 00:28:21.064
some methods to add this subtitle.

00:28:21.094 --> 00:28:23.194
I'll show you the easiest way.

00:28:23.585 --> 00:28:24.695
It's manually.

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:25.924
Click on manually,

00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:27.273
and below your video,

00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:30.065
you'll find a window
that shows your audio signals,

00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:37.894
and on the screen here,
you can add your subtitles manually.

00:28:38.014 --> 00:28:40.775
You can control your subtitles
in the timeline,

00:28:41.045 --> 00:28:45.844
and the result is here shown
in the video on YouTube.

00:28:48.005 --> 00:28:53.134
What you see here is
the subtitle of this video,

00:28:53.135 --> 00:28:56.222
and this is manually added.

00:29:00.235 --> 00:29:06.274
One problem is these subtitles
on YouTube are only in YouTube.

00:29:07.264 --> 00:29:08.704
They are part of YouTube.

00:29:09.004 --> 00:29:10.834
They are not part of your video.

00:29:10.924 --> 00:29:12.605
If you download your video

00:29:13.204 --> 00:29:20.408
and put it in the WordPress media tick,
the subtitles are gone.

00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:24.035
The subtitles are only in YouTube visible.

00:29:26.045 --> 00:29:30.843
That's the normal way you embed
in WordPress the YouTube video

00:29:30.844 --> 00:29:33.545
with the YouTube Gutenberg block

00:29:34.684 --> 00:29:36.004
and then

00:29:37.534 --> 00:29:41.194
on your website,
the subtitles are not shown.

00:29:41.824 --> 00:29:44.674
Please give your website visitors
a hint and say

00:29:45.394 --> 00:29:48.034
view on YouTube to see the subtitles.

00:29:48.275 --> 00:29:52.384
You have to go away
from the WordPress website,

00:29:52.385 --> 00:29:54.934
and the subtitles
are only shown on YouTube.

00:29:57.095 --> 00:30:00.005
The next thing is
about embedding your video

00:30:00.664 --> 00:30:03.994
on your WordPress website
or embedding your audio.

00:30:09.045 --> 00:30:13.543
What is nice to have is
an adjustable playback speed

00:30:13.544 --> 00:30:15.284
for your website visitors.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:19.963
Adjustable playback speed allows
your website videos to control

00:30:19.964 --> 00:30:21.315
the speed of an audio.

00:30:22.095 --> 00:30:27.105
This helps people who want to slow down
the audio file for better comprehension

00:30:27.195 --> 00:30:29.474
or speed up for faster listening.

00:30:30.374 --> 00:30:33.584
The Gutenberg Audio Block
is a very simple solution.

00:30:34.275 --> 00:30:37.844
You won't find a knob
for playback speed control,

00:30:37.845 --> 00:30:46.515
but this block is better than you think
because you right-click on the player,

00:30:46.995 --> 00:30:47.865
select speed,

00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:51.944
and then everybody has the possibility

00:30:51.945 --> 00:30:56.594
to select the speed
between 0.5 or double speed.

00:30:58.245 --> 00:31:01.215
It's not so easy to find.

00:31:01.844 --> 00:31:06.375
If you want to have
a more comfortable solution,

00:31:06.854 --> 00:31:10.454
you have to use plug-ins
like the audio player block,

00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:13.003
but for playback speed control,

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.534
you need the pro version.

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:20.354
With this version only you can disable
the playback speed adjustment option,

00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:22.154
so you have to pay a little bit.

00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:29.774
Next thing is you should provide
download options for your audio files

00:31:29.818 --> 00:31:34.095
so that everybody can download it
and can hear it in his own room.

00:31:35.925 --> 00:31:37.755
It's no problem

00:31:38.744 --> 00:31:41.444
with some things
who are not going to say,

00:31:41.494 --> 00:31:45.734
"Okay, it's my audio thing
and have problems with copyright,"

00:31:45.835 --> 00:31:48.445
then you should not do it.

00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:50.505
For accessibility,

00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:55.455
it's nice to have to say,
"Yes, you can download my audio files."

00:31:56.404 --> 00:31:57.614
How works this?

00:32:00.554 --> 00:32:02.985
With the Gutenberg Audio Block,

00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:09.885
it's the same as speed control.

00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:11.564
You have to do a right click

00:32:12.285 --> 00:32:16.106
and then you select download
in the context menu

00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.795
and so everybody can download

00:32:19.545 --> 00:32:20.545
your audio file.

00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:28.005
If you want to have it
a little bit more comfortable,

00:32:28.785 --> 00:32:31.815
you need a solution with a download icon.

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:37.035
For the option to download

00:32:37.815 --> 00:32:42.764
the audio file directly from the player
and you don't have this way have

00:32:43.308 --> 00:32:46.004
to do it with a right-click thing.

00:32:47.384 --> 00:32:48.854
For these things,

00:32:49.245 --> 00:32:52.604
you also have to use
an audio player plug-in.

00:32:53.644 --> 00:33:00.104
I've tested the CP media player
and the plug-in Audio Player Block.

00:33:01.095 --> 00:33:04.875
Both show a download button.

00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:09.733
The CP Media Player shows
a download button in the free version,

00:33:09.734 --> 00:33:11.864
and if you use the Audio Player Block,

00:33:12.404 --> 00:33:17.325
it shows a download button
only in the raw version.

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:26.655
As the last step, you have done your best.

00:33:27.224 --> 00:33:33.584
You have recorded high-quality audio,
or let's say good enough quality audio.

00:33:34.274 --> 00:33:35.865
You have edited

00:33:36.374 --> 00:33:38.204
and enhanced your audio.

00:33:40.695 --> 00:33:43.382
You have created a transcript,

00:33:43.383 --> 00:33:47.534
and this grant
you don't have only created it,

00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:50.025
you have put it
on your website; it's clear.

00:33:51.034 --> 00:33:53.415
There's the audio player,
and the audio player,

00:33:53.415 --> 00:33:56.804
you can hear
it, and under the audio player,

00:33:56.864 --> 00:34:01.634
you have a text file
with a transcript of this audio.

00:34:04.995 --> 00:34:06.225
Another method is

00:34:07.275 --> 00:34:12.404
to do it the way with YouTube and say,

00:34:13.544 --> 00:34:15.525
I provide everything on YouTube,

00:34:15.584 --> 00:34:16.725
make a picture,

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:23.924
make an audio file and work with subtitles
so create transcripts or add captions.

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:29.653
Then you have embedded it
with the native Gutenberg block

00:34:29.654 --> 00:34:31.245
or with a plug-in,

00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:37.305
and nice to have you provide
a download options.

00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:40.935
Last step you want test the accessibility,

00:34:42.704 --> 00:34:47.025
and here we have first,
you do a quality check.

00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:54.043
You can do it by yourself is
your audio content clear and easy

00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:58.274
to understand,
or are here disruptive background

00:34:58.275 --> 00:35:01.604
sounds don't work
with so much background sounds?

00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:10.875
Has your audio content transcripts,
and do you provide playback speed control?

00:35:11.264 --> 00:35:15.675
This is what you ask yourself
if you have done all these things.

00:35:16.424 --> 00:35:18.555
Then there are some testing tools.

00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:23.882
There are assistive technologies
like screen readers.

00:35:24.997 --> 00:35:29.030
JAWS is a good screen reader,
and then you should test

00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:35.084
that you have a screen reader
and you have the native audio file.

00:35:36.765 --> 00:35:41.655
Is this working,
or are there any interferes

00:35:41.684 --> 00:35:45.640
between screen readers
and native audio files?

00:35:46.084 --> 00:35:47.565
This is what you should test.

00:35:48.314 --> 00:35:55.724
You have automated tools like WAVE,
and then you have some testing software,

00:35:55.925 --> 00:36:03.645
you can use a WordPress plug-in
or you have external testing software.

00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:07.455
This is called audit software
who's testing your website,

00:36:07.864 --> 00:36:11.841
and maybe use both and say, yes.

00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.145
My website is fine,

00:36:14.985 --> 00:36:16.544
has good audio quality,

00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:24.345
and works fine, and then you are happy
and your users are happy.

00:36:25.155 --> 00:36:30.344
Now I am at the end
of my first Zoom recording.

00:36:30.734 --> 00:36:32.385
I enjoyed it very much.

00:36:33.285 --> 00:36:36.164
I hope you enjoyed it too.

00:36:36.495 --> 00:36:38.774
We come to the last page.

00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:40.634
Thank you for watching,

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:47.295
and now we have time for some Q&A
for some questions and answers,

00:36:47.355 --> 00:36:50.505
and I'm happy to hear
about your questions.

00:36:57.149 --> 00:36:59.086
Alexandra Blanco: All right,
thank you so much, Bernd,

00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:02.255
that was such an amazing presentation.

00:37:02.275 --> 00:37:07.015
Thank you for spotlighting
what audio is

00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:08.888
and how it needs to be accessible.

00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:12.078
It's really, really interesting,
all the things you said.

00:37:12.098 --> 00:37:14.538
I really enjoyed reading the chat,
people

00:37:14.558 --> 00:37:18.368
getting to know what work to do
when working with audio

00:37:18.388 --> 00:37:24.491
and the things that we should take care
of before posting it on the websites.

00:37:24.737 --> 00:37:27.754
I have a couple of questions here
prepared for you.

00:37:27.854 --> 00:37:30.391
The first one comes from Nassim,

00:37:30.434 --> 00:37:32.211
and they want to know,

00:37:32.231 --> 00:37:36.834
well, he says, I'm exploring ways
to add a subtle button click sound

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.181
for better feedback,

00:37:38.201 --> 00:37:40.584
but I want to make sure
that it's accessible.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:43.641
Do you recommend
using audio libraries for this?

00:37:43.751 --> 00:37:46.970
I mean, audio resources
for the website?

00:37:50.085 --> 00:37:55.434
Bernd Schmitt: I'm not sure
how works this with screen readers.

00:37:55.661 --> 00:37:59.008
I hope this works fine with screen,
you have to test this.

00:37:59.082 --> 00:38:02.745
But when you use,
you need a click sound,

00:38:02.765 --> 00:38:08.025
then you should use,
I think it's a good idea to use libraries

00:38:08.058 --> 00:38:11.054
because they provide
a high quality click sound.

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.799
When you do it by yourself,

00:38:13.032 --> 00:38:14.464
maybe try it

00:38:14.502 --> 00:38:16.248
this way, sounds not so good.

00:38:18.415 --> 00:38:22.197
Use libraries then,
but test it with a screen reader,

00:38:22.213 --> 00:38:23.213
I would say,

00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:25.142
if there's any interference

00:38:25.162 --> 00:38:28.110
with the click sounds
and the screen reader.

00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:31.086
Alexandra: Awesome, thank you.

00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:35.695
Delightsome wants to know
if you have a YouTube channel.

00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:37.508
I believe someone already answered,

00:38:37.528 --> 00:38:41.395
but just to make sure that
we have the right YouTube channel.

00:38:41.565 --> 00:38:43.022
Do you have it?

00:38:43.126 --> 00:38:44.206
Bernd: No,

00:38:45.466 --> 00:38:48.391
I have a YouTube channel
with my band,

00:38:49.872 --> 00:38:54.257
but I don't have a YouTube channel
for my WordPress things.

00:38:54.291 --> 00:38:59.265
I'm just starting this
with accessibility.

00:39:01.882 --> 00:39:04.104
Alexandra: That's fine.
Thank you so much.

00:39:04.692 --> 00:39:07.420
Sorry, did you want to say
something else?

00:39:08.628 --> 00:39:09.628
Bernd: I?

00:39:09.675 --> 00:39:11.635
Alexandra: Yes, I thought that, okay,

00:39:12.402 --> 00:39:13.568
sorry.

00:39:13.895 --> 00:39:16.494
Next question comes from Amy.

00:39:16.903 --> 00:39:21.874
Do you recommend using normalize
before compressor or after?

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.735
Bernd: I've shown it in the video,

00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:32.309
first compression,
then normalization.

00:39:32.866 --> 00:39:37.815
Because when the signal
is normalized, no,

00:39:37.873 --> 00:39:41.091
first compression,
then normalization, that's it.

00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:45.581
It's important
when the signal is too low,

00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:47.684
make another recording.

00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:51.070
You can't fix everything in the mix.

00:39:52.818 --> 00:39:53.831
Alexandra: Yes, thank you.

00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:55.959
Amy says, that seems logical.

00:39:55.969 --> 00:39:57.805
Thank you for confirming.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.974
On to the next question.

00:39:59.994 --> 00:40:02.479
This one is by Anonymous.

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:08.116
If people want to learn more from you,
where can they find you on social media?

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:12.494
Bernd: I started with
all this audio stuff.

00:40:13.305 --> 00:40:18.242
I think SoundKlapp is my name.

00:40:18.532 --> 00:40:19.829
But I have to,

00:40:20.112 --> 00:40:24.044
this is K-S-O-U-N-D,

00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:27.841
K-L-A-P-P.

00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:31.078
You find me on,

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:37.787
I have to look at Bluesky,

00:40:37.807 --> 00:40:39.659
I have to check, sorry.

00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:42.478
Alexandra: That's okay.

00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:48.488
I wrote down SoundKlapp
for the anonymous person

00:40:48.508 --> 00:40:50.645
who wrote that question.

00:40:50.742 --> 00:40:54.396
So they have it right there
if they want to look for it.

00:40:57.813 --> 00:40:59.198
While you look for that,

00:40:59.218 --> 00:41:01.658
I think I'm going to jump
into the next question.

00:41:01.678 --> 00:41:03.788
This one was by Mark.

00:41:04.399 --> 00:41:06.590
Are there any rules or guidelines

00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:10.190
similar to images
being decorative for video?

00:41:10.213 --> 00:41:13.329
That is, if the visuals
in the video aren't adding value

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:17.222
that make the video more or less
the closed captions but full size.

00:41:17.296 --> 00:41:18.794
You know what I mean?

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:21.562
Bernd: Not really, sorry.

00:41:23.267 --> 00:41:26.329
Alexandra: Okay,
so I think Mark wants to know

00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:28.037
if you would say

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:33.272
that you would have certain rules
for making audios

00:41:33.292 --> 00:41:36.840
that are similar to
what we know about making images.

00:41:36.856 --> 00:41:41.613
So as an example,
they say that if the visuals

00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:44.810
you add to a video
are not adding value,

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.130
then just don't add it.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.182
Bernd: Yes, Amy Lettson has found me.

00:41:51.202 --> 00:41:54.394
I'm also [?] on Bluesky.

00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:56.145
I don't know how she managed it,

00:41:56.186 --> 00:42:00.614
but that's my secret
militant cycling account.

00:42:03.463 --> 00:42:04.975
Alexandra: Thank you, Amy.

00:42:11.804 --> 00:42:14.291
Bernd: If there are things in audio,

00:42:14.382 --> 00:42:15.383
I've understood it.

00:42:15.437 --> 00:42:19.343
There are some pictures
who are decorative,

00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:24.351
and how would you describe this
in audio?

00:42:25.423 --> 00:42:27.294
Alexandra: Yes, how to make sure that

00:42:27.315 --> 00:42:33.447
we are not over-adding things in audio
or adding distractions, maybe.

00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:44.528
Bernd: The first rule is don't use
too many background things in audio.

00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:49.476
Then you don't have to describe
these background things.

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.028
Alexandra: Sure.

00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:55.560
I think that's fine.

00:42:56.292 --> 00:42:59.707
If Mark wants to deep dive
on that question,

00:42:59.727 --> 00:43:02.628
they can also find you
on social media.

00:43:03.153 --> 00:43:04.374
Thank you.

00:43:04.441 --> 00:43:07.474
The next question comes from Emilio.

00:43:08.066 --> 00:43:12.128
They say, is AI impacting
sound business overall,

00:43:12.195 --> 00:43:15.532
and what tools can I use
as a beginner?

00:43:15.695 --> 00:43:17.608
Bernd: AI is really hardcore.

00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:19.362
I am a musician.

00:43:19.392 --> 00:43:22.916
I am a sound producer,
and I like producing sounds.

00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:25.974
And if you take AI, I'm shocked

00:43:26.022 --> 00:43:31.556
because it's really good quality
what you can do with AI sounds.

00:43:31.595 --> 00:43:33.397
This is bad.

00:43:37.103 --> 00:43:39.524
To mix with AI, I don't know.

00:43:39.832 --> 00:43:43.772
When I'm mixing
and doing my audio production,

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.164
I have an audio engineer
and mastering engineer

00:43:47.184 --> 00:43:48.704
who helps me.

00:43:53.112 --> 00:43:57.336
I want this music, this kind of music,
and then I don't use AI.

00:43:57.342 --> 00:44:00.449
But I think AI is getting
better and better,

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:09.990
you can't tell if it's done
by an audio engineer or AI.

00:44:10.035 --> 00:44:13.645
It's horrible how good AI is
in music production.

00:44:15.101 --> 00:44:17.527
Because I learned all these tools,
and then this sounds,

00:44:17.547 --> 00:44:19.159
"Hey, I've done it with AI.

00:44:19.183 --> 00:44:20.749
It's as good as you."

00:44:25.001 --> 00:44:28.054
Alexandra: Sure. Yes, I think AI

00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:32.043
is disrupting every business
in either a good way or a bad way,

00:44:32.064 --> 00:44:34.077
and we have to adapt to it.

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:36.872
Thank you for that answer.

00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:40.222
Next question comes from Colton.

00:44:40.426 --> 00:44:43.684
For something like radio, PSA,
or podcast,

00:44:43.704 --> 00:44:49.005
does it make sense to include a download
of a text file of the entire transcript?

00:44:49.965 --> 00:44:52.861
Bernd: You want to download
the transcript?

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:58.896
Alexandra: Yes, they want to know
if it's okay to download

00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:02.454
the entire transcript of the podcast,

00:45:04.784 --> 00:45:08.334
and include a download link

00:45:08.354 --> 00:45:13.046
for the people to read along
or for deaf or hard of hearing people

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:15.280
to be able to read through it.

00:45:15.581 --> 00:45:18.877
Bernd: I think it's fine to have
a download link for people

00:45:18.897 --> 00:45:21.291
who have special needs.

00:45:21.558 --> 00:45:26.523
I want to hear it
with my audio equipment.

00:45:27.586 --> 00:45:30.877
Yes, but it's dangerous

00:45:30.897 --> 00:45:37.686
because then everybody
has your podcast

00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:38.835
on his computer.

00:45:39.285 --> 00:45:44.377
You must decide if you take that risk
or if you say, no,

00:45:44.457 --> 00:45:48.996
I don't want the people
give away my podcast.

00:45:52.122 --> 00:45:54.467
Alexandra: All right. Thank you.

00:45:55.244 --> 00:45:58.585
Then another question from Josue.

00:45:58.909 --> 00:46:03.924
Do live radio pages should stick
to transcripts and audio quality?

00:46:05.927 --> 00:46:10.576
Bernd: Do live audio pages?

00:46:10.723 --> 00:46:13.128
Alexandra: Live radio pages, yes.

00:46:19.018 --> 00:46:22.417
Bernd: I'm not an expert
for radio pages.

00:46:25.458 --> 00:46:26.638
Sorry.

00:46:29.196 --> 00:46:32.500
Should radio pages have transcripts?

00:46:33.077 --> 00:46:35.408
Live radio-- Is it your radio page?

00:46:35.428 --> 00:46:39.654
Are you providing a radio page?

00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:47.063
Alexandra: I don't know if you can
clarify that in the chat, Josue,

00:46:47.084 --> 00:46:50.124
so we can better answer your question.

00:46:52.925 --> 00:46:57.333
While we're at that, another question
that came up was Mark,

00:46:57.353 --> 00:47:01.617
and they are discussing in the chat

00:47:01.697 --> 00:47:07.142
the examples that I gave you about
video and audio being similar in ways

00:47:07.162 --> 00:47:11.627
that we shouldn't use something
that is not adding value.

00:47:12.672 --> 00:47:13.956
They say, for example,

00:47:13.976 --> 00:47:16.952
if the majority of the video
is just two people with mics,

00:47:16.972 --> 00:47:20.374
then that's more or less
a decorative video.

00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:22.517
So just make the video the text

00:47:22.571 --> 00:47:25.447
and have the small window
of the main video.

00:47:27.914 --> 00:47:31.661
Just for a clarification about that.

00:47:33.138 --> 00:47:38.883
Then Doug asks, by radio page,
do you mean like a podcast, Josue?

00:47:42.594 --> 00:47:44.613
Well, we're going to wait for that.

00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:46.826
Maybe we won't have time
to answer that.

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:54.460
But just know that Bernd gave
their social media accounts.

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:57.799
So if you want to reach out
with more questions about it,

00:47:58.486 --> 00:48:00.229
please feel free to make that.

00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:07.821
Bernd: I'm just watching
if I have it on Bluesky and Soundklapp.

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:11.860
Yes, yes, yes.

00:48:11.893 --> 00:48:17.081
Okay.
I give you all my account for Bluesky.

00:48:18.135 --> 00:48:20.736
And on Bluesky, it's called

00:48:22.963 --> 00:48:28.529
S-O-U-N-D

00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:34.227
and then K-L-A-P-P dot D-E.

00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:38.994
This is my Soundklapp on Bluesky.

00:48:41.742 --> 00:48:43.085
Yes. That's it.

00:48:43.163 --> 00:48:45.032
