<v OSDEIBI ACURERO> Hello everyone,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.173
I'm Osdeibi Acurero from Venezuela.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.985
I have been working with WordPress
for more than 10 years,

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.721
during which I have worked

00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:04.764
as a full-time developer
with a strong knowledge of PHP.

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:06.342
Over this time,

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:11.677
I have acquired a skill that allowed me
to create powerful tools and websites,

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:15.397
but for a long time,
I overlooked accessibility.

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:17.551
But once I gave it importance,

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:21.755
I saw how it's improved my project
and my coding skill.

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:24.289
One of my biggest lessons
was to understand

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.661
that each person
sees things differently,

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:29.590
this including the website.

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:31.535
Today I'm going to explain you

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:36.271
why it's important to apply accessibility
in your plugin development.

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:40.565
We must remember that
plugins are the backbone of WordPress,

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:46.056
and if they are not accessible,
we are excluding a large group of people.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:49.185
To make this clear,
I will show you some examples

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:50.902
and some key tips

00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:54.245
to fix your accessibility issue
in your plugins.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:58.106
Today we will be talking
about several topics

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.964
that will help you not only
in developing WordPress plugins,

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:06.011
but also in creating teams
or a complete website.

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:10.327
Remember that accessibility
is more than just a metric.

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:12.821
There are several things
you must first consider

00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:14.634
when you are creating a plugin,

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:18.893
and you want to ensure that you meet
all the accessibility requirements.

00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:20.807
The first thing is to understand

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:26.672
that accessibility is not just limited
to color contrast or screen readers.

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:30.118
You must also focus
on internationalization,

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:35.625
because accessibility is not just
about coding, for example.

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:40.117
When you are making your plugin
available in other languages,

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:43.372
it's also a way to make it
accessible to everyone.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.498
We know that English
is widely used in technology,

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:51.820
but in my case, for example,
as a non-native English speaker,

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:56.228
there were contents initially
that I did not understand.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.669
This is what was hard
at the beginning to interpret.

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:04.951
When we talk about
internationalization,

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.851
it's not only about
preparing the code

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.951
or the interface
to be ready to the translation.

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:14.022
It's also about understanding

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:17.762
that there are many
different writing systems.

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:20.616
For example, the right-left layout,

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:25.519
and also we have a different variation
in number format and currencies.

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:28.442
If we create a plugin
hard-coded in English,

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:30.143
we are building a barrier.

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:34.460
For this, WordPress have
an extended documentation

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.363
and show us the correct way to do it.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.352
Using, for example,
the internationalization functions

00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:43.561
and also following all the standards,

00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:46.360
we can allow our
plugin to be accessible.

00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:51.019
Probably you might ask, like,
for example, like, hmm,

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.863
what happens if I only know English?

00:05:53.883 --> 00:05:57.481
Or how can I bring my plugin
to other languages?

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:03.302
We have the answer for that,
because WordPress is an amazing community,

00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:06.939
and we have a community
that collaborates in all the areas.

00:06:07.374 --> 00:06:11.256
One of these is the community
of volunteer translators.

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:14.583
They can help us
to make the plugin accessible.

00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:20.070
By simply asking the community
for help in translating the plugin,

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:23.690
we can find many people interested
in contributing.

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:29.375
The process will be on
the availability of these volunteers.

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:32.885
A good way to make your
plugin visible and translated

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:35.431
is by participating in WordCamps,

00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.815
where there are often working groups,

00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:41.015
and usually one
is dedicated to translation.

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:44.754
You can directly ask
for collaboration.

00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:46.707
In conclusion, we can say that

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:50.722
internationalization
is the first step towards making

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:52.717
our plugin accessible.

00:06:52.737 --> 00:06:55.771
There is something we must consider
when starting to write code,

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.533
which is understanding
the conformance level,

00:06:58.553 --> 00:07:00.847
the A, AA, and AAA,

00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:03.895
which are the standard
in accessibility.

00:07:04.432 --> 00:07:06.909
We can quickly understand it
as the following.

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:09.948
As for example,
the level A is the most basic

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:13.982
and the most relaxed of
the level of web accessibility,

00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:18.736
because it's a good starting point,
but often is not enough.

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:21.840
The second is the level AA

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:24.821
that is designed to be
the minimum standard

00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:27.462
because it includes
all the level A criteria

00:07:27.482 --> 00:07:29.833
plus the additional requirements.

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.434
The final is the AAA level.

00:07:32.454 --> 00:07:35.673
This is the highest degree
of web accessibility.

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:37.631
It cannot always be achieved

00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:40.202
because it depends on the type
of the content,

00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:43.628
but it is the closest
to the full compatibility.

00:07:44.813 --> 00:07:48.035
These levels are applied
through researches,

00:07:48.055 --> 00:07:52.988
studies, and testing to ensure
that they are aligned with the standards.

00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:54.125
For example,

00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.894
in our recent project, Amidjob,

00:07:55.914 --> 00:08:00.048
we were creating several web tools
in the medical field.

00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:03.271
We have to adhere to
local government regulation

00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.685
to guarantee accessibility
for everyone.

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:10.728
This can also happen with websites
or software in banking,

00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:12.074
in healthcare,

00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:17.515
also in government sectors,
where accessibility must be present.

00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:18.843
I have an example here.

00:08:18.863 --> 00:08:21.986
One of the ways
we can solve accessibility problems

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:27.662
for people with visual impairment
is by adding the extra HTML.

00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:30.439
This attribute
we can add it in our code.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:35.832
In this example, we can see a simple form
with an input or a label for each input.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.952
Often when we are writing HTML,

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:42.843
we ignore the semantic HTML

00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:46.076
and also the attributes
or the properties.

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:48.693
I have seen many forms
that include a label,

00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:52.795
but the input itself
doesn't have assigned ID.

00:08:54.144 --> 00:08:57.849
in that case,
the label only works visually,

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.032
but is not accessible.

00:09:00.052 --> 00:09:01.323
For example,

00:09:01.343 --> 00:09:04.838
people with visual impairment
use a screen reader,

00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:07.854
which reads out everything
as they navigate.

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:12.562
They interact with the website
using a special keyboard navigation.

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:17.320
Also we can simulate this
in our computer and browser

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.351
by pressing the tab key
in our keyboard.

00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:22.756
When we press the tab key,

00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:26.603
the focus starts moving
through the website structure.

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:32.046
If we don't have this included
in the proper label,

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:37.064
users relying on the screen reader
won't know what each input is for.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:41.586
Especially for the label
that exists for the for attribute

00:09:41.606 --> 00:09:44.997
that is linked to the input ID.

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.598
Sometimes for design reasons,

00:09:47.618 --> 00:09:53.454
developer omit the label and only rely
on the placeholder inside the input.

00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:59.324
This is for indicate what they are for,
such as first name and last name.

00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:03.824
This can look fine visually,
but is not accessible.

00:10:03.844 --> 00:10:07.672
Since the screen reader
don't always treat placeholder

00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:09.702
as a descriptive label,

00:10:09.722 --> 00:10:12.992
if you choose not to display
a visual label,

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:18.063
you must still add
accessibility instruction in your HTML.

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:21.353
For example,
you can add ARIA label attribute

00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:25.329
inside your input
to indicate what is the use for.

00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:28.131
For example,
if we add this ARIA label here,

00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:30.658
we can say that
this is for last name.

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:33.970
This tells the screen reader

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.798
what is the representation
of the input.

00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:41.303
When the user start
tabbing inside the field,

00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:44.042
the screen reader will announce
what it is.

00:10:44.272 --> 00:10:45.272
Without this,

00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:49.686
the visual impaired user
cannot properly navigate your site.

00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:52.231
When using semantic HTML correctly,

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:54.767
if a label is linked to the input,

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:58.064
clicking the label moves
the cursor to the input field.

00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:03.583
The visual and functional connection
is part of the accessibility standard.

00:11:03.603 --> 00:11:09.252
Therefore, whenever we write HTML code,
we must follow semantic principles

00:11:09.272 --> 00:11:12.792
because the input should have
the required attribute

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:15.102
to ensure the accessibility,

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:16.934
not just the visual appeal.

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:20.960
We can also use
the browser developers tool.

00:11:21.304 --> 00:11:25.008
We can test the accessibility
here right now in our browsers.

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:28.339
We can use the DevTool Accessibility panel
for that.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:32.506
If we want to enable it,
we can press the control shift E.

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.159
And after that,

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.420
we can start typing accessibility,

00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:41.133
and we can find
the option show accessibility.

00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:45.857
When it's activated,
you will see an accessibility view

00:11:45.877 --> 00:11:50.023
that the whole screen reader
will represent the page.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:54.537
Once you are enabled the option,
you will see this small icon here.

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:57.012
If you switch to
the accessibility tree,

00:11:57.032 --> 00:12:02.764
you will see the different components
inside the website for accessibility.

00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:07.004
You can go directly to the correct tab,
to the attributes,

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:08.242
and also you can check

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:12.435
if they have the accessibility
in the HTML.

00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:15.926
You can see
such as the navigation, the link.

00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:18.265
Also, you can have the heading,

00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:20.548
the paragraph,
and also all the information.

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:26.775
This is the way how the screen reader
will interpret all the website.

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:32.385
When we are creating others or working
with dynamic elements such as JavaScript,

00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:35.375
we must take other into consideration,

00:12:35.395 --> 00:12:38.688
especially if we are using
a screen reader.

00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:42.188
Often, if we don't set
the correct attribute,

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:46.682
people using a screen reader
will not be able to perceive the other.

00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:52.096
To fix this,
the user should use the alert attribute.

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:57.073
This allows the screen reader
to detect and read the alert to the user.

00:12:57.549 --> 00:13:01.308
Another thing to consider is that
if you're using alert,

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:04.317
they should be either be
dismissable with a button

00:13:04.337 --> 00:13:06.863
or remain in the screen
for a longer time.

00:13:07.477 --> 00:13:11.235
This is important for users
with motor impairment,

00:13:11.255 --> 00:13:14.209
seeing if the alert disappears
too quickly,

00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:17.603
they might not have enough time
to take the action.

00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:21.882
Imagine if a confirmation button
that vanish

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:23.297
before they can click.

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:27.648
The ideal approach
is to give the alert

00:13:27.668 --> 00:13:31.687
a long duration
or include an actionable button,

00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:34.763
for example,
a close or accept or deny button.

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:37.789
We can see an example here
in this form.

00:13:37.809 --> 00:13:43.406
If we click the submit button
and let me get a lower timer here.

00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:49.333
For example, if we have a form here
and we have the submit button with alert,

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:52.374
you will see that
I have a lower timer on it.

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:54.896
It's impossible for me
to read what is inside,

00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:58.983
or it's impossible for me
to click in the button.

00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:05.149
The idea here is to have a higher timer
or doesn't have a timer at all.

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:07.649
You can have your own alert here,

00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:10.607
and you can have your button
to dismiss the alert

00:14:10.627 --> 00:14:13.260
or take the action inside the alert.

00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:16.106
The idea in this is that

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:18.912
when you are working
with a dynamic content,

00:14:18.932 --> 00:14:22.103
you need to think
about accessibility.

00:14:22.123 --> 00:14:27.568
The idea here is
to get the ARIA label for it

00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:29.116
for the screen readers

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:32.883
and also have the time
for people to go there

00:14:32.903 --> 00:14:36.103
into the alert
and start clicking the buttons.

00:14:36.123 --> 00:14:38.985
For people who have trouble
distinguish colors,

00:14:39.005 --> 00:14:42.298
whether they are color blind
or they have difficulty

00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:44.241
in defining certain color

00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:49.216
or struggling to read text due to
the poor construct with the background,

00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:52.773
the DevTool provides
a very useful tool

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:56.073
that let us check
whether the color choosing

00:14:56.093 --> 00:14:59.688
for the text or the background
meet the accessibility standard

00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:01.953
for the AA or AAA.

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:06.470
We can go directly here
and use the DevTools for it.

00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:10.878
Let's go to the example,
and we can go directly to this heading here.

00:15:10.898 --> 00:15:15.997
This is a hidden H3,
and we can change the color to red, maybe.

00:15:16.954 --> 00:15:19.961
We can use the DevTool

00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:24.477
to test how good is this color
for the website.

00:15:24.497 --> 00:15:29.072
If we go to the color here,
we have this option, the contrast radio,

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:35.210
and we can see that we don't meet
the AA or the AAA standard yet.

00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:36.887
If you see here,

00:15:36.907 --> 00:15:39.913
you will see there is
a line between the colors.

00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:46.124
That means if we go directly
to any color inside these two white lines,

00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:51.184
we are going to have a right color
for the AA standard.

00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:55.906
We can go to the red,
the specific red, more darker red,

00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:57.227
and we can choose it.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:16:00.503
Also we can use the automatic tool.

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:04.613
We can use here
inside the DevTool this option.

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:07.361
We can use for the suggested color

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:13.248
for the low contrast
in comparison with the white background.

00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:18.078
We check it here,
we are inside the AA standard.

00:16:18.314 --> 00:16:22.134
If we go lower manually here,
we can comply with the AAA.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.711
Doesn't matter what color we use,

00:16:24.731 --> 00:16:29.005
we can use
the automatic color picker for that.

00:16:30.044 --> 00:16:34.092
When you are working with colors

00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:37.212
and when you are working with contrast,

00:16:37.232 --> 00:16:43.523
if we don't stay inside the certain line,
it doesn't meet the AA standard.

00:16:44.082 --> 00:16:48.744
If we can move it a bit or go all down,
we can meet the AAA standard.

00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:52.650
This is a helpful tool
because it gives you

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:57.500
the visual representation of
how accessible is your color.

00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:03.134
If you adjust
the color slightly to meet the AAA,

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:06.692
you will notice that there
is no almost difference.

00:17:06.712 --> 00:17:12.258
For example if we choose this color here,
for example, this is red,

00:17:12.278 --> 00:17:14.434
and we can go a lower here,

00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:18.334
you will see no visual changes at all.

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:24.882
When you are working
with the backgrounds and the color,

00:17:25.174 --> 00:17:27.205
don't be too hard with the design.

00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:30.007
Try to meet
all the accessibility requirements.

00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:33.494
If you want to check
the contrast outside the DevTool,

00:17:33.514 --> 00:17:37.817
also there are different free online tools
that you can choose

00:17:37.837 --> 00:17:40.006
and you can use for free.

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:41.173
For example,

00:17:41.653 --> 00:17:47.501
some color combination
will fail in the reading test.

00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:52.393
For example, if you are doing
a plugin or a theme for WordPress,

00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:57.457
you can go directly and use the same color
that you find inside the admin.

00:17:58.098 --> 00:18:00.879
Because WordPress have
the perfect color for contrast

00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:05.248
and don't over complicate your design.

00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:09.323
You can go for a simple design

00:18:09.343 --> 00:18:12.251
and you are so compliant
with the accessibility.

00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:16.737
Another DevTool feature useful
for accessibility testing

00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:19.072
is that allow you to simulate

00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:22.015
how user with visual impairment
see your site.

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:28.118
For example we go to the DevTool here
and we can activate it by ctrl shift

00:18:28.402 --> 00:18:32.985
so and we can--
right here so show rendering.

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:38.214
Once we have this option here,
we will see here in the DevTool,

00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:42.346
so let me just change my zoom here.

00:18:42.366 --> 00:18:44.601
Okay. We can go to the rendering tool

00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:49.885
and go directly to the end
and the emulate vision deficiency.

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:54.798
In this tab, we can emulate
blurred vision,

00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:56.780
reduce contrast protection.

00:18:57.963 --> 00:18:59.939
For example, someone with contrast issue

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:02.692
might struggle to read the text
in dark background.

00:19:02.712 --> 00:19:06.647
We can test every case here
for example

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.410
and we can go for blurred vision

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.331
and you see how is the website
right now.

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:15.232
This is the way I look at every website
if I remove my glasses.

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:18.307
For example,
if I go to the reduce contrast,

00:19:18.327 --> 00:19:21.719
I will see that all people
with this problem

00:19:21.739 --> 00:19:23.292
will see the website.

00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:26.808
Also I can choose
for different other problem

00:19:26.828 --> 00:19:27.974
for vision deficiency.

00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:29.455
For example, there is something

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:31.622
that I didn't know about it that

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:35.887
there is people
that doesn't perceive colors as well.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:40.396
For example, if we have for--
let me just change the emulation here,

00:19:40.416 --> 00:19:42.980
and you will see
what I'm talking about.

00:19:43.207 --> 00:19:44.990
If we remove the emulation,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.094
you will see that
we have a red title here.

00:19:48.403 --> 00:19:51.283
There is people
that doesn't perceive the red color.

00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:55.637
If we choose this emulation,
we will see what happen

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.947
if we don't perceive the color.

00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:04.549
One of the biggest mistake I was doing
when I was creating interfaces for user

00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:09.692
or admins was creating
the okay button as green

00:20:09.712 --> 00:20:12.987
and the cancel
or the error button as red.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:16.912
There's people
that doesn't perceive the color as well,

00:20:16.932 --> 00:20:20.693
so you need to find a balance
where your color meet

00:20:20.713 --> 00:20:26.285
the visual problem.

00:20:27.484 --> 00:20:30.466
If you go again, I will say it again,

00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:34.302
WordPress have
the better contrast background,

00:20:34.322 --> 00:20:35.784
they have the better score,

00:20:35.804 --> 00:20:40.899
because this is not pure white
or pure black.

00:20:41.648 --> 00:20:45.983
You can start playing with your color
for your new interfaces,

00:20:46.003 --> 00:20:47.989
for your plugins for your team.

00:20:49.508 --> 00:20:53.037
If you do that, if you go
to the pure black or pure white,

00:20:53.057 --> 00:20:56.148
you will make the reading
not comfortable at all.

00:20:56.168 --> 00:20:57.361
What will also will help you

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:01.466
to improve the accessibility
when building your plugin, your team

00:21:01.486 --> 00:21:04.153
is writing semantic HTML.

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:07.637
This means that you need to use
the proper text for the header,

00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:09.344
articles, button,

00:21:09.364 --> 00:21:12.051
anchor text,
and all the other elements.

00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:13.371
What is the difference

00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:16.158
in using the semantic HTML

00:21:16.178 --> 00:21:19.454
and start focusing
on the nesting deep element?

00:21:19.853 --> 00:21:24.784
Visually, you have here an example
of the same structure of the website.

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:32.068
Basically, is the same visually for us,
but if we are using a screen reader,

00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:33.855
is going to be a chaos

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:37.608
because the user won't be guide
correctly to the content

00:21:37.628 --> 00:21:40.674
and will have difficulty
understanding this.

00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:45.314
The best approach is to stop relying
on the multiple nested DIVs.

00:21:45.588 --> 00:21:49.240
We need to start using
the semantic element properly.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:56.178
For example, if you are using a header,
use the header tag itself for the HTML.

00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:59.392
Also for the section,
the articles and the footer.

00:21:59.412 --> 00:22:01.526
This is the only way that

00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:04.093
your plugin your team,

00:22:04.113 --> 00:22:07.843
is going to be perfect for accessibility
and screen readers.

00:22:07.863 --> 00:22:11.983
Every image should include
at least the alternative attribute

00:22:12.003 --> 00:22:15.357
because this will provide
the alternative text.

00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:18.889
The alternative text
will describe the image,

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:23.209
so when someone is reading your article
or your website with a screen reader,

00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:25.377
they will know there is an image

00:22:25.397 --> 00:22:27.917
and understand what it represents.

00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:33.431
Use the alternative only for images
that are the real value or content.

00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:37.045
Avoid doing it in logos, icons,

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.696
or decorative images

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:43.400
because this will not contribute
in a meaningful information

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.590
for the content.

00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:50.442
This approach go
with the principles of semantic HTML,

00:22:50.462 --> 00:22:54.114
and using the right element
and the attribute will give you

00:22:54.758 --> 00:22:56.758
the proper content structure

00:22:56.778 --> 00:23:01.693
and the purpose for your website
or even for your team or for your plugin.

00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:04.884
It can also happen that
some people with dyslexia

00:23:04.904 --> 00:23:07.512
find it difficult to read long text.

00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:09.467
The best thing that we can do

00:23:09.487 --> 00:23:12.431
is giving them the option
to use a different font.

00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:15.343
This is possible
by downloading a free font.

00:23:15.363 --> 00:23:19.334
For example, Google fonts
offer one called Lexend.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.961
If we provide
this accessibility feature

00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:23.707
to let the user change the font,

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:27.045
even the difference
might not seem very noticeable,

00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:28.288
but for people

00:23:28.308 --> 00:23:31.600
who struggle with reading
will appreciate it.

00:23:32.047 --> 00:23:36.583
This font are specifically designed
to reduce the visual fatigue

00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:41.683
and help individuals with dyslexia
to recognize words more easily.

00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:44.892
People with motor impairment
may struggle to use a mouse,

00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:48.412
a touchscreen,
or even keep the hands steady

00:23:48.432 --> 00:23:50.091
when they are navigating.

00:23:50.468 --> 00:23:52.198
To reduce the errors, ensure

00:23:52.218 --> 00:23:55.859
that your design provides
the adequate spacing

00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:59.337
between targets
and all the interactive elements.

00:23:59.357 --> 00:24:01.786
For example, if you have five buttons

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.516
and this button doesn't have
a space between,

00:24:04.536 --> 00:24:06.413
it's going to be hard for people

00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:09.022
that have motor impairment
to start navigating.

00:24:09.042 --> 00:24:12.148
For example, if we see
the example here,

00:24:12.168 --> 00:24:17.664
we can see that we are emulating
a website mobile with button here.

00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:21.283
This small circle here
represent the finger.

00:24:21.303 --> 00:24:24.552
For example, if I go to A maybe

00:24:24.572 --> 00:24:28.745
I'm going to start hitting the B
or even other buttons.

00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:32.327
When you add this spacing between it,

00:24:32.347 --> 00:24:35.261
and you meet
the accessibility requirement,

00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:38.665
you will have a better interface
for users.

00:24:39.028 --> 00:24:41.746
This is going to reduce the errors,

00:24:41.766 --> 00:24:45.043
and it's going to be
a more friendly design

00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:47.119
for all the people in your website.

00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:49.315
Many users navigate websites

00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:51.163
using only the keyboard

00:24:51.183 --> 00:24:54.526
and not only using a mouse
or a touchscreen.

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:56.669
This include people
with motor disability,

00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:57.660
visual impairment

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.461
or people that using
assistive technology

00:25:00.481 --> 00:25:01.703
like a screen reader.

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:04.578
For them, every interaction element

00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:08.990
must be reachable
and operable with the keyboard.

00:25:09.555 --> 00:25:12.588
When auditing your WordPress plugin,
you should verify

00:25:12.608 --> 00:25:13.885
that all the buttons,

00:25:13.905 --> 00:25:19.803
all the links and all the informed inputs
can be reached using the tab key.

00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:25.847
Also it can be activated with the enter
or escape in the navigation order.

00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:27.714
It must remain logical.

00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:34.655
If the focus moves unexpectedly
or skip any element user can get lost.

00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:37.899
A common accessibility problem
in plugins

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:40.287
is missing the focus indicator.

00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:44.284
Some developer removed this indicator
for aesthetic reasons.

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:51.312
This also leave the user unable to see
where is the focus actually.

00:25:51.332 --> 00:25:55.166
Always keep or customize
your visible focus style

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:58.594
to be remaining there
in your website.

00:25:58.984 --> 00:26:01.629
In addition to visible focus,

00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:03.382
the plugins

00:26:03.402 --> 00:26:07.117
that are using modals
or are using pop-ups

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.377
may use the drop focus.

00:26:09.397 --> 00:26:13.018
Because the drop focus
will remain inside the modal

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:13.836
while it is open.

00:26:13.856 --> 00:26:18.108
For example, if I'm open this modal
and then start using the tab key,

00:26:18.128 --> 00:26:20.670
I will remain inside the modal.

00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:26.218
This can be achieved
using JavaScript for the behavior.

00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:30.335
You should ensure also that
when the model opens,

00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:35.496
the focus remain automatically
in the first interactive element.

00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:37.757
Also when it's closed,

00:26:37.777 --> 00:26:40.397
the focus should most return
to the button

00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:42.147
or the link that opened it.

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:45.378
If I go there and I close the modal,

00:26:45.398 --> 00:26:49.347
I will be here directly
in the button to the open modal.

00:26:50.953 --> 00:26:55.286
This provides a complete
and predictable navigation flow.

00:26:55.892 --> 00:27:01.062
Finally, when you are running
or you are updating your website

00:27:01.082 --> 00:27:03.974
or your plugin with Lighthouse
or the DevTool,

00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:08.026
you can go and check
for focus-related warnings.

00:27:08.046 --> 00:27:11.153
These tools can detect
the missing focus style

00:27:11.173 --> 00:27:13.663
or the incorrect tab order.

00:27:14.887 --> 00:27:17.544
You always need to test it manually.

00:27:17.564 --> 00:27:20.724
Don't always rely on the automatic test.

00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:26.041
Because nothing will replace
pressing the tab in your interface.

00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:27.974
If you implement this

00:27:28.673 --> 00:27:33.316
with the keyboard navigation
and the focus management,

00:27:33.336 --> 00:27:36.682
you make your plugin
very useful for everyone.

00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:39.630
Not only for the users
that rely using a mouse.

00:27:41.444 --> 00:27:45.026
Accessibility is not only visual.

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:49.381
It's also to ensure the equal control
and interaction.

00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:52.526
Another simple
but powerful accessibility feature

00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:56.487
that we can include in our plugin
is a color switcher.

00:27:56.507 --> 00:27:59.256
This allows the user to choose
between the light, dark,

00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:01.171
or high contrast theme

00:28:01.191 --> 00:28:04.563
according to their visual
preference or needs.

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:09.529
Some users experience a light stream
with a bright background.

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:14.019
While others require a strong contrast
to read the text clearly.

00:28:14.352 --> 00:28:18.955
By adding this small tool,
it will save the user choice.

00:28:19.695 --> 00:28:21.999
We are giving the control over

00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:25.485
how they are experiencing
our interfaces.

00:28:25.935 --> 00:28:29.014
This is a short of a piece of code,

00:28:29.034 --> 00:28:31.861
but it demonstrates
the real empathy in design.

00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:35.086
Because we are adapting
our tools to the user

00:28:35.106 --> 00:28:37.176
and not the other way around.

00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:39.595
Among the different tools
that we can use

00:28:39.615 --> 00:28:42.312
to improve
the accessibility integration.

00:28:42.332 --> 00:28:46.308
We as a developer,
we can use the ESLint plugin.

00:28:46.581 --> 00:28:48.124
this plugin will help you

00:28:48.144 --> 00:28:51.009
by suggesting the way
to improve your code.

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:56.908
There are many ESLint versions
for HTML, PHP, and JavaScript.

00:28:58.288 --> 00:29:00.895
They don't only help you
with the accessibility.

00:29:00.915 --> 00:29:04.089
This also will help you
to make a better programmer

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.307
by encouraging you to use
the semantics,

00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:09.096
the well-writing and readable code.

00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:14.302
By doing this, you also ensure that
your website and all your workflow

00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:17.334
are going to be
in the best practice standards.

00:29:17.354 --> 00:29:20.186
Another tool that
you can use is Lighthouse.

00:29:20.206 --> 00:29:25.024
Lighthouse provides you performance
throughout the entire website.

00:29:25.044 --> 00:29:29.192
Lighthouse is integrated directly
in the web tool from every browser.

00:29:29.212 --> 00:29:30.635
Also you can use

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:34.656
the Lighthouse information
for the web page speed insight.

00:29:35.094 --> 00:29:37.306
This will give you information

00:29:37.326 --> 00:29:40.622
and will give you
accessibility perspective.

00:29:41.202 --> 00:29:43.386
It will help you
to identify all the issues

00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.642
your website has.

00:29:44.963 --> 00:29:47.127
For example,
if you have missing attributes,

00:29:47.147 --> 00:29:49.703
images without alternative text,

00:29:49.723 --> 00:29:51.666
and other accessibility problems.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.508
Also it will give you an insight
and documentation on how to fix them.

00:29:59.223 --> 00:30:01.342
This makes you very useful

00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:04.290
for checking how accessible
is your website or your tool,

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.936
or whatever you are doing,

00:30:05.956 --> 00:30:09.989
and you can have the report
in mobile and desktop too.

00:30:10.009 --> 00:30:13.056
Remember that in DevTool,
you can also access

00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:17.033
the accessibility feature
from the element inspection panel.

00:30:17.053 --> 00:30:19.073
You can enable it readily

00:30:19.093 --> 00:30:23.672
with the option with Ctrl Shift P
and writing show accessibility.

00:30:23.952 --> 00:30:27.653
Once it's enabled, a button appear
allowing you to switch

00:30:27.673 --> 00:30:29.967
from building the code as a developer

00:30:29.987 --> 00:30:31.977
and directly seeing

00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:35.126
how is the accessibility
focus browser interpreted.

00:30:35.551 --> 00:30:36.421
If you switch here,

00:30:36.441 --> 00:30:38.635
you will see the difference
between the code

00:30:38.655 --> 00:30:41.765
and how the screen reader
see your website.

00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:45.470
It will let you to see the difference

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.797
in even you can modify properties
to test and also to improve.

00:30:50.175 --> 00:30:53.064
Additionally, in DevTools
under the rendering tab,

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:56.393
you can simulate
different accessibility scenarios.

00:30:56.413 --> 00:30:59.163
For example,
you can emulate visual impairment

00:30:59.183 --> 00:31:01.440
like blurriness or color brightness.

00:31:01.936 --> 00:31:04.448
You can test the different
accessibility modes

00:31:04.468 --> 00:31:08.134
such as reducing motion
or high contrast setting.

00:31:08.805 --> 00:31:10.388
It will help you to understand

00:31:10.408 --> 00:31:13.436
what can be improved
for better accessibility.

00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:15.364
When we finish developing a plugin,

00:31:15.384 --> 00:31:17.735
we usually test functionality
like for example

00:31:17.755 --> 00:31:20.846
if the button are working,
if the form is submitting,

00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:25.043
or if the settings are saving
correctly in the database.

00:31:25.063 --> 00:31:28.836
But most of the developers
forget one essential step

00:31:28.856 --> 00:31:31.624
that is testing all the accessibility

00:31:31.884 --> 00:31:33.492
before releasing the plugin.

00:31:34.145 --> 00:31:37.657
Testing accessibility
doesn't always require

00:31:37.677 --> 00:31:43.828
that you have advanced knowledge
or you are using specialized tools.

00:31:43.848 --> 00:31:46.642
You can follow a simple
three-layer process.

00:31:46.662 --> 00:31:49.488
You can always check
your manual keyword testing

00:31:49.963 --> 00:31:53.409
using the screen reader
and automatic analysis.

00:31:53.844 --> 00:31:56.751
For example, for the keyword testing,

00:31:56.771 --> 00:32:01.349
before using any interface
inside your plugin,

00:32:01.369 --> 00:32:05.896
try to navigate your plugin interface
using only the keyboard.

00:32:06.254 --> 00:32:09.298
If you can go through
every interactive element,

00:32:09.318 --> 00:32:12.151
if you can activate it
with the enter or the escape,

00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:15.095
and you never lose the visible focus,

00:32:15.115 --> 00:32:17.155
your plugin then are ready

00:32:17.175 --> 00:32:21.311
to start covering a large part
of the accessibility focus.

00:32:22.885 --> 00:32:25.104
This means that
you are almost ready to go.

00:32:25.698 --> 00:32:27.714
Then you can check

00:32:27.734 --> 00:32:30.595
if it's working
with the screen reader check.

00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:33.923
There are a lot of free software
that you can test.

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:39.069
In Windows, you can use NDVA,
and macOS, also in Linux,

00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:41.602
you can use a variation
of this software.

00:32:41.842 --> 00:32:44.632
This software basically
is a screen reader.

00:32:45.466 --> 00:32:47.699
You don't need to be a master using it.

00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:51.112
Because if you start using it
and you listen

00:32:51.132 --> 00:32:55.830
that if the reader knows every control,
every font field, every button,

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.913
or every message clearly,
you are doing it fine.

00:33:00.497 --> 00:33:03.781
If you are using it and you read
and you hear something

00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:05.678
like button unlabeled,

00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:08.503
that means your code
is missing something.

00:33:09.444 --> 00:33:13.899
Especially for the semantic HTML,
you are missing ARIA labels,

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:15.687
or you're missing attributes.

00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:19.518
Finally, you can do
this automatic analysis.

00:33:19.906 --> 00:33:24.056
You can use like, for example, Lighthouse,
you can use Chrome Dev,

00:33:24.076 --> 00:33:27.670
or even you can use
any other browser station

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:31.189
to start testing what is happening
inside your plugin.

00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:35.937
These tools will not figure
your code automatically

00:33:35.957 --> 00:33:38.640
because it's only a test.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.617
But this will tell you
what you need to fix inside your code.

00:33:43.637 --> 00:33:46.292
It will tell you where to start looking

00:33:46.312 --> 00:33:49.205
inside your plugin
or inside your interface.

00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:55.055
Remember that WordPress is used
by a lot of people in the Internet.

00:33:55.724 --> 00:33:58.454
When the plugin fails
the accessibility,

00:33:58.474 --> 00:34:00.397
it will multiply the program

00:34:00.417 --> 00:34:04.156
across the multiple thousands
of WordPress users.

00:34:05.272 --> 00:34:09.795
Always try to test the accessibility
before releasing

00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:14.408
because it will ensure that
your code is not only working.

00:34:15.194 --> 00:34:17.612
You can ensure that
it's working for everyone.

00:34:19.335 --> 00:34:21.150
I think this final step

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.804
will transform your plugin
from functional to inclusive.

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:29.728
This is the real goal
for accessibility.

00:34:29.748 --> 00:34:30.757
That's all for now.

00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:35.216
I encourage you to apply
this practice in your plugin.

00:34:35.236 --> 00:34:38.818
Share your findings
with the community and keep learning.

00:34:38.838 --> 00:34:41.902
Remember,
accessibility is a continuous journey

00:34:41.922 --> 00:34:47.459
and every line of accessible code
make the WordPress ecosystem stronger.

00:34:47.479 --> 00:34:51.688
Thank you for your attention,
for your interest in accessibility,

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:54.999
and for helping make the web
a better place for everyone.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.699
<v Sherose Badruddin> Amazing.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.479
Thank you for
your presentation, Osdeibi.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.759
Was very informative,
in your instructions

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.359
or your examples
were very, very detailed.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.219
I feel like there was that happening

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.319
and then there was a lot
of conversation in the chat.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.399
We've got a bunch of questions,
so I'm just going to hop right in.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.949
The audience, we should have time

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.569
for more questions
than what's already

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.459
in the Q&amp;A, so please don't be shy.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.019
Go ahead and put them in there.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.089
I want to talk about
something you mentioned

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.799
in the chat that I think
might be important,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.529
especially as we're
an international conference.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.349
You talked about not being
a native English speaker and finding

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.769
that plug-in documentation
was often written in English.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.779
I'm also not a native speaker,
but I've been speaking

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.059
for a long time, so I'm comfortable,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.609
but if I were to read
in a different language,

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.199
I would be struggling too.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.649
The question that I was asked
of you is if you've tried AI tools

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.379
for translation, and if so,
what worked for you?

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.839
<v Osdeibi Acurero> Oh yes,
I have been using ChatGPT

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.479
because for example,
in my journey starting

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.659
for a new Plugin,
I know a little English,

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.549
so I can write some labels,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.059
I can write some text,
but there is some content

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.969
that are out of my understanding,

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:21.280
so I use these tools,
AI tools, mostly ChatGPT

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.679
for that,
but sometimes the translation

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.670
is not accurate 100% but I mean,

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.479
if you are using the AI
or using any tools,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.380
it's a good start, and if you don't,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.999
you are not good in the English

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.919
or other language and you want
to make your Plugin accessible

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.879
in other language,
I think that the approach

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.399
is going to directly with the AI,

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.367
so there is a lot of tools
that you can use for it.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:55.620
Also, you can always ask
for help from the community,

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.539
so something
that I like for WordPress

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.539
is like every WordCamp that I go,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.669
I wrote directly
to the translator table,

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.339
and they say, "Hey guys, how are you?

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.783
I have two projects here,
so I need help in translation."

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.286
You can find there also not only
in automatic tools,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.780
that is a good start,
but also you can rely

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.886
in the community as well.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.539
<v Sherose Badruddin> Amazing.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.689
That makes a lot of sense.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.939
What are the most common issues

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.352
that you find
when you are auditing Plugins?

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.139
<v Osdeibi> I think
in most of the cases,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:39.140
like when you start
auditing the Plugins,

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.189
I think the biggest problem
is the semantic HTML.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.759
For example,
there is a lot of missing labels.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.880
For example, inside the contact form

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.519
or any other form, you will see

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.099
that there are missing labels

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.699
because something
like I say in my presentation,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.299
like most of the designers
remove the visual label,

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.394
and also the developers
remove the code.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.079
I think this is the biggest
problem when you are working

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.589
with Plugins in the [unintelligible].

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:16.139
Also, when the Plugin doesn't have

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.679
the tab navigation in the keyword,

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.649
it's a problem
because most of the people use,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.349
they don't only use a screen reader,

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.666
they can use a computer
with any other tool,

00:38:28.676 --> 00:38:31.480
so they rely only in the keyword.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.589
I think it's a big problem.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.235
Another problem is the contrast.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.364
You don't need
to have a visual problem,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.179
to start experimenting
problems with contrast.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.335
Because, for example, in my case,
I can spend like 10 hours

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.529
in the computer working on something.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.709
When I switch to other social page

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.649
or every other page,
I see a high contrast,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.460
and I feel very stressed about it.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.079
This can happen
also inside the Plugins.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.619
Like, for example,
if you have something

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.229
inside your administrator

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.276
or even that is something
different in your website.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.702
I think this is the biggest
problem when I'm starting.

00:39:18.703 --> 00:39:21.419
It's like they are not following

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.817
along with the semantic HTML.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.529
<v Sherose> Semantic HTML is so important.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.989
I was noticing in your response,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.059
but also in the examples
that you shared,

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.029
that many of your strategies
are similar

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.419
to the ones that somebody
would use to audit a website.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.459
I personally,
just to speak for myself,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.859
did not know DevTools could do

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.909
all the things that you showed.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.689
I'm going to have to rewatch
this recording and take more notes.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.549
That's really useful,
I think, also to point out

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.909
because it shows that it's possible

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.259
to audit these Plugins

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.629
and there's like
a user-friendly way to do it.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.189
It could just be a browser tool

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.419
that you don't even have to download.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.059
It's right there.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.699
I love that.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.589
I think that makes the testing

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.139
of the accessibility
accessible, right?

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.379
<v Osdeibi> Yes, sure.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.099
Also, not only in the developer tool,
for example,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.219
you can find
the Plugins inside WordPress

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.889
that help you to check
your accessibility.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.469
Also, you can go
directly to your browser

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:21.644
and start installing
attention, looking--

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.180
Once you open the idea
of accessibility,

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.847
you will find a lot of tools.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.499
<v Sherose> We've got
some more questions in the chat,

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.259
but I want to ask you something
about what you said here.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.089
When you do find an issue,

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.422
do you ever reach out
to the Plugin author?

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.059
<v Osdeibi> Sorry, can you please
repeat the question?

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:44.699
<v Sherose> Sure.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.129
Whenever you find issues,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.949
like let's say you found
a pretty severe issue,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.689
do you ever reach out to the author?

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.784
If so, what kind
of response do you get?

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.449
<v Osdeibi> Oh, well,
that's a problem

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.820
because when you are doing--

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.759
I'm going to be
beyond the Plugns also.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.059
For example,
I'm going to the most common example

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.374
when you're doing a website.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.567
When you are doing a website,

00:41:07.568 --> 00:41:11.852
most of the decisions
don't rely on you as a developer.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.870
For example, you have a project
manager, you have a requirement.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.840
I think it's hard
to avoid that problem.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.540
I think when that happens,
it's like you raise

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.699
the hand and say, "Okay,
I have a problem with this.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.579
I found this problem
here with the accessibility."

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.953
It's possible, like, for example,

00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:41.150
see the redesign or,
for example, we can change

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.399
this for making it more accessible.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.732
Sometimes, when that happens
is because when you receive

00:41:47.733 --> 00:41:50.299
the requirement
to start working on it,

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.539
most of the project itself,
or project manager

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.689
or client itself, doesn't rely

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.479
on or doesn't care
about the accessibility.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.419
Most of the cases, for example,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.379
when you're doing a website,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.506
they rely on the accessibility
like a metric for SEO.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.700
I think, yes,
it's a big problem there.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.704
<v Sherose> Actually brings
us to an audience question here.

00:42:15.705 --> 00:42:17.899
You wrote in the comment
that accessibility starts

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.849
with developers, in your opinion.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.939
What prevents developers
to adopt that mindset?

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.689
Do you think it's life experience
or just simply not having

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.864
the knowledge
to build for accessibility?

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.109
<v Osdeibi> I don't think it's a big fall

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.959
from the developer itself because,
for example, in my experience,

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.300
when I start learning PHP and HTML,
and JavaScript,

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.019
all the courses and all the videos
that I found on the internet

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.039
and all the learning,
they go directly like

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.839
for the solution like this is the way
you can create a website.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.728
In that step,
when you start and you are doing it,

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.846
there are some theories
behind that you left behind,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.472
for example, the semantic HTML.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.315
I think the problem is that,
like most of the free lessons

00:43:12.316 --> 00:43:15.359
that you find in internet,
doesn't teach you,

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.772
like for the semantic HTML,
like easy basic.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.109
You need to write a beautiful code

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:25.314
that you will see in your editor,
but also you need to write a code

00:43:25.315 --> 00:43:28.647
for everyone
when they switch to different.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.119
I think the biggest problem
that it's not a developer itself.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.220
I think it's all the education
documentation

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.540
and also the learning
path that they are choosing.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.849
<v Sherose> I think
you're right there.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.279
Then maybe also like
if you're not working

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.899
for someone, like you mentioned,

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.139
there's so many people
sometimes involved in these projects.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.339
If you're not working with someone

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.531
on the team
that has this information,

00:43:53.532 --> 00:43:55.099
then it's already missing
in your culture.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.489
It's already missing
from your accessibility process.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.769
That actually leads
to another audience question.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.219
How did you get introduced
to accessibility,

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.709
and how long did it take
you to get to the point you are now?

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.709
Do you have any advice
for plugin developers who want

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.963
to learn more about
what you shared today?

00:44:14.675 --> 00:44:15.939
<v Osdeibi> It took me a while

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.590
because in all my years
working as a developer,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.259
I never care about accessibility.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.099
It took me a while to understand

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.699
what is accessibility
because at the beginning,

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.746
I was looking for accessibility
as a metric for SEO,

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.219
and I don't know,
for maybe for a crazy tool

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:40.742
in the internet that showed
me that it's going to be okay.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:44.359
I think maybe about five years ago,

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.981
I realized that taking accessibility

00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:51.740
for real, for a serious topic.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.792
I think it was like five years
ago when I started realizing

00:44:58.793 --> 00:45:02.443
that it's important
to make the web accessible.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:07.370
I hope that when I start,

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:10.340
I really like to, for example,

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.381
learn all the accessibility
because if I did it 10 years ago

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.679
for accessibility inside my code,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.360
I think I can develop
a better website from scratch.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.850
I think my advice for new developers

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.439
that they are trying
to build in the Plugin

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.809
is to focus in semantic HTML.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.249
This is the first thing
that you need to do.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.129
For example, go directly
from your form and go

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.259
to the labels, go to the inputs.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.149
It doesn't matter if you are doing

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.149
a smaller or large Plugin
or an important plugin,

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.355
or it's just like a Sunday project
that you are doing.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.540
Because this is a small
effort inside our code inside

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.779
that we are doing in the Plugin,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.529
it's going to help the accessibility,

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.340
and it will help all the websites.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.780
I think that when you are starting
at least one semantic HTML,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.919
at least when you are putting
a label inside the form,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.659
you are helping in the accessibility.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.659
Also, you are like doing
a conversion,

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.050
not only that, you are focusing only

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.329
as a developer in your code,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.299
and also you are caring
about other people.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.379
<v Sherose> You are right.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.554
Just doing this work
has its own rewards.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.459
This next question I think,
is a little challenging.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.330
Should WordPress,
as a content system, be firmer

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.279
in demanding accessibility?

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.939
Or is it better left
to developers, designers,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.079
and content authors
to have that responsibility?

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.229
<v Osdeibi> Yes.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.966
It's a hard question.

00:46:52.115 --> 00:46:54.859
It depends on where you're looking

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.349
the Plugin itself because,
for example,

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:58.819
I love Deployment as a developer,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:03.320
and I think Deployment
will be a star as a developer.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:10.059
When you are working a bigger team,
a bigger company, I think

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.996
the responsibility
should start there.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:18.950
I think WordPress
can do something about it.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.579
For example, it can encourage
you to do it, but I don't think

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.659
it can force you to do it

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.860
because there are a lot
of limitations.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:34.379
I think the demanding
accessibility will come

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.719
from the client itself
or the person doing that project.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.539
For example,
something that I talked about

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.669
in my presentation was I'm working
on a project in my current job,

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.606
and we are developing a medical tool.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:51.700
For the law,

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:01.219
we need to create all the system
accessible because it's the law.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.699
We don't do it like we can go
to a fine,

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:09.939
go to a jury, and it depends.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.433
It's not that easy, for example,
to force WordPress

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.730
to demanding that to the developers.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.779
<v Sherose> I think you're right.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.449
Because to do that
would also require setting up

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.709
a testing process,
and then finding enforcement,

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.319
and then how are we managing updates?

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.009
There really is so much to it,

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.889
which is why it's so
important for everyone

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.839
to learn digital accessibility

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.179
to understand semantic HTML,
all the things that you said.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.499
Osdeibi, we are out of time.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.299
