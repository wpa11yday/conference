>> ALICIA ST. ROSE: Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.309
My name is Alicia St. Rose
from WP with Heart.

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.110
Thank you for joining us

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:49.948
for Auslan Accessibility
in WordPress, Themes,

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:53.852
and Plugins for the Whole
Deaf Australian Community,

00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:55.987
with Shawn Phua.

00:01:55.988 --> 00:01:59.897
Shawn is a profoundly
Deaf Asian-Australian man

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:03.229
in his 30s who has lived in Meanjin,

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:07.432
Brisbane, Australia,
for most of his life.

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:10.902
He is fluent
in Auslan and English and does

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:13.104
not lip-read or speak.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.708
Shawn was born
to Malaysian-Chinese-hearing parents

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.912
in a multilingual family where
English is their fourth language

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:26.185
after Cantonese, Malay,
Bahasa Malaysia, and Mandarin.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.286
Shawn and his parents communicate

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:30.956
in a mixture of signs from Auslan,

00:02:30.957 --> 00:02:34.926
Australian Signed English,
Malaysian Sign Language,

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.863
and Singaporean Sign
Language at home.

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:41.900
Shawn has experience
in teaching and tutoring,

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.336
and supporting
a wide range of people,

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:47.038
including families of Deaf children,

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.574
hearing Auslan students, participants

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:52.344
from National Disability
Insurance schemes,

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:54.980
and migrants, refugees, adults,

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:57.984
and seniors from various communities.

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.685
He holds multiple screening checks

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.554
and Working with Children cards

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:06.024
across different Australian states
and territories.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.928
Shawn enjoys collecting resources
about different sign languages,

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:14.065
such as dictionaries,
books, posters, and flyers.

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:17.569
He also likes learning signs,
alphabets,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.872
and numbers from other sign
languages, especially when he meets

00:03:20.873 --> 00:03:23.141
Deaf visitors from other countries

00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:26.078
or Deaf First Nations Australians,

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:29.382
migrants, and refugees in Australia.

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:33.016
Please feel free
to ask your questions

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:34.986
in the Zoom Q&A section,

00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:38.556
and we'll answer them
at the end of this session.

00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:41.326
Also, don't forget
to use the chat to connect

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:43.063
with other attendees.

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:51.449
>> SHAWN PHUA: Hello, everyone.

00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:55.091
My name is Shawn Phua,

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:59.679
and I am completely Deaf.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.650
My preferred pronouns

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.022
are he, him, and his.

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:13.192
I'm very excited to present today

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.634
for about 30 minutes about

00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:22.835
Auslan Accessibility
in WordPress Themes,

00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:28.374
and all of the things
that incorporate

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.878
the Deaf community
and involve them in Australia.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:37.048
I know this is
an international audience.

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:42.388
However, I'm from Australia,
and I also have captioning enabled.

00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:51.896
The overall goal is to educate
people and ensure

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:56.102
that things like WordPress
and websites

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:00.657
are completely accessible,
culturally appropriate,

00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:05.336
and affirming
for the Australian Deaf community,

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:08.446
where Auslan is visible, respected,

00:05:08.447 --> 00:05:11.751
and integrated
into digital experiences.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:18.847
As I mentioned,
I'm Shawn, and Auslanism

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:22.094
is my business, my small business.

00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:26.999
I live in Australia,
in Brisbane, Queensland.

00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:35.640
First of all, "How to get
a Deaf person's attention?"

00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:41.180
A gentle tap on the shoulder
or on the upper arm

00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:44.617
is quite respectful to Deaf culture.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:50.555
This slide is about
Deaf people being able

00:05:50.556 --> 00:05:54.860
to do anything except hear.

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:59.365
What we do is hear through our eyes.

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.771
You may wonder
what the Auslan alphabet,

00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:09.642
fingerspelt alphabet, looks like.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.306
This is just a small example.

00:06:12.878 --> 00:06:16.047
In Australia,
an Australian sign language known

00:06:16.048 --> 00:06:20.518
as "Auslan" uses a two-hand
fingerspelling method.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.887
For example, in America,

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:26.057
they use a one-handed
fingerspelling method

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:28.626
through ASL, American Sign Language,

00:06:28.627 --> 00:06:31.296
and in international sign language,

00:06:31.297 --> 00:06:34.471
used by the World
Federation of the Deaf,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.036
for Deaf people,
uses a one-handed sign language

00:06:38.037 --> 00:06:40.186
which is different to ASL.

00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:44.452
In Australia, Deaf people
sign a little differently.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.544
They might sign "B"

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:50.015
in two different ways, "P" or "S,"

00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:54.687
just as people
might pronounce different words

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:56.788
in a different accent.

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.591
We all have slight differences.

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:03.995
An interesting fact is,
the Australian fingerspelt alphabet

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:07.066
originated
from British Sign Language,

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:10.469
going back
when Australia was colonized.

00:07:11.537 --> 00:07:14.540
BSL has its own sign language,

00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:18.643
and it also uses
a two-handed fingerspelling,

00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:21.289
which is very similar to Auslan.

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.851
Auslan Video Integration.

00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:29.922
You might be thinking
about how WordPress

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:32.223
and the internet, and websites,

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:35.327
can be accessible
to the Deaf community.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:44.168
These points on the PowerPoint
outline some suggestions

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.273
for integrating Auslan translations.

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:52.076
Using English text as well,

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:55.180
either above
or below the information,

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.517
can assist Deaf people to understand

00:07:59.518 --> 00:08:02.253
information
in their preferred language

00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:05.690
and make it easy English,
simplified English,

00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:08.418
rather than using too much jargon

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:14.905
and highfalutin words,
because Deaf people

00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:17.806
might find that difficult to follow.

00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:21.911
Using accessible videos,

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:26.645
using things like players,

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:34.219
AblePlayer, Video.js,
or WordPress-compatible plugins.

00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:42.428
That will support transcripts
and easy playback controls,

00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:50.369
which makes it much easier
for Deaf people to navigate.

00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:57.795
Try to provide short video
explainers for key pages

00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:04.917
such as the homepage,
the contact page,

00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:08.754
and particular forms
that might be integrated.

00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:12.918
Otherwise, things
can be quite complicated

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.068
and difficult to navigate.

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:23.469
Fourthly, using picture-in-picture
split screen layouts,

00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:27.905
having things side by side.

00:09:27.906 --> 00:09:29.807
If there's a presenter,

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:35.347
trying to put the Deaf interpreter
or the translator,

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:39.671
whether they be a
hearing-translator/interpreter

00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:41.953
or Deaf interpreter, side by side,

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:45.223
so it's very visually easy to glean

00:09:45.224 --> 00:09:47.869
the information by the audience,

00:09:49.528 --> 00:09:52.163
and it's easy to navigate as well.

00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:57.703
On my laptop,
whether I use a computer or an iPad,

00:09:57.803 --> 00:10:02.941
I make sure that the audience
can see me today,

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:06.458
even though my laptop is different

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:10.282
to what you're seeing on the screen.

00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:14.786
Deaf people and hearing people

00:10:14.787 --> 00:10:18.056
might be interpreters,
but we need to make sure

00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:23.094
that they are framed correctly
so that it's very easy to understand

00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:26.903
the sign language,
and the hands are not cut off.

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:29.797
There are particular themes

00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:32.714
that are accessible and plugins.

00:10:34.573 --> 00:10:38.744
You would need to select
WordPress themes

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:41.858
that are compatible

00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:47.218
to (WCAG) 2.1 so they're compliant

00:10:47.219 --> 00:10:52.791
and they support the embedded
media without breaking the design,

00:10:54.293 --> 00:10:57.562
because if that design is broken,

00:10:57.563 --> 00:11:03.102
Deaf people will decide
perhaps not to engage.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.042
We want Deaf people
to engage in all of your websites,

00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:15.473
so it's important
to have that design element

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.683
and navigational elements.

00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:24.069
Navigation is really
important for Deaf people.

00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:29.561
Also, using plugins in your design.

00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:35.067
Using the "Accessibility Widget"

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:38.911
or the "Accessible Video Gallery,"

00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:43.841
which ensures that videos
and the navigation is compatible

00:11:43.842 --> 00:11:49.281
with screenreaders
and also with keyboard controls.

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:51.449
There are some Deaf people

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.053
who are also visually impaired
or blind, and so they use

00:11:56.054 --> 00:11:59.193
those particular elements
to read scripts

00:11:59.194 --> 00:12:03.028
through English texts or transcripts.

00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:06.797
There are also Deaf people
who might not use sign language

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:11.402
and rely on the written word
and audio descriptions as well.

00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:13.634
When I'm signing in Auslan,

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:20.711
having my video
as I'm signing enables people

00:12:20.712 --> 00:12:22.513
to actually see who I am,

00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:28.519
and having an audio description
can explain what I look like,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.089
so it's really good to include

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:39.063
every element and the plugins
as well that allow

00:12:39.064 --> 00:12:42.935
the toggling
and the different features.

00:12:43.402 --> 00:12:49.173
For example,
showing an Auslan video means

00:12:49.174 --> 00:12:55.347
that the Deaf Australian community
can follow along.

00:12:55.414 --> 00:12:57.481
Information is accessible.

00:12:57.482 --> 00:12:59.517
Somebody who might be hard

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.654
of hearing might need
to select "closed captioning"

00:13:03.655 --> 00:13:05.804
to access the information.

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:10.461
It would be different
depending upon what type

00:13:10.462 --> 00:13:13.130
of Deafness the person has,

00:13:13.131 --> 00:13:17.019
and remembering
that your audience will be varied,

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:19.928
there would be signing Deaf people,

00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:24.176
Deaf people who don't sign,

00:13:24.643 --> 00:13:26.745
hard-of-hearing people,

00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:31.250
and Deafblind people.

00:13:33.218 --> 00:13:36.387
Deaf people also might
have additional disabilities

00:13:36.388 --> 00:13:38.155
and different needs,

00:13:38.156 --> 00:13:42.526
so ensuring that your plugins
will support and respond

00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:45.696
to the design that's required.

00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:52.136
Auslan videos can also be viewed
on tablets as well as iPhones,

00:13:52.137 --> 00:13:54.368
different types of devices.

00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:59.110
On the slide here,
there's some examples

00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:01.679
where the British Deaf community

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.516
in the UK, the company called Signly,

00:14:05.517 --> 00:14:08.754
has really good design elements.

00:14:12.357 --> 00:14:18.714
They use sign language
on top of the screen

00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:21.055
that's being displayed.

00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:25.437
They use very advanced technologies,

00:14:25.904 --> 00:14:30.242
so they might be worth
Googling after my presentation.

00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:35.022
For Deaf people that struggle
with English literacy,

00:14:35.714 --> 00:14:38.883
it's much more friendly in terms

00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:44.455
of access for Deaf people
to be more independent,

00:14:44.456 --> 00:14:49.127
not relying on family
and friends to get information.

00:14:49.828 --> 00:14:52.530
Having that type of design means

00:14:52.531 --> 00:14:58.736
that the person can highlight
a sentence on the screen,

00:14:58.737 --> 00:15:01.505
and Signly will translate

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:04.909
that into British Sign
Language via video.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:10.015
This technology
is patented by Signly,

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:15.087
and it is used, now, more and more.

00:15:16.588 --> 00:15:19.398
It's BSL, "British Sign Language."

00:15:19.424 --> 00:15:22.460
It can also be used
for American Sign Language

00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.106
and South African Sign Language.

00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:30.968
Australia is still negotiating
with Signly to try

00:15:30.969 --> 00:15:34.539
and use this technology
in our country,

00:15:35.107 --> 00:15:39.176
but we are a little
disadvantaged because of the cost,

00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:40.678
and we need to make sure

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:43.298
that the Australian
government legislation

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:48.586
for equal access and disability
access is compliant

00:15:48.587 --> 00:15:52.189
with what's happening in the UK
and the British legislation.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.493
At the moment,
we're a little behind that--

00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:58.496
British Sign Language,
because it's in their legislation,

00:15:58.497 --> 00:15:59.930
they're getting more access.

00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:02.867
Something interesting to think about.

00:16:03.602 --> 00:16:07.807
Next, I'd like to talk about
User-Friendly Navigation,

00:16:07.873 --> 00:16:11.681
and there are a few points
up on this PowerPoint.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.449
Using a simple menu and structure

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.133
that is clearly labeled,

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:26.091
and avoiding, as I mentioned before,
too much jargon.

00:16:26.558 --> 00:16:29.656
Deaf people may not
understand the jargon,

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:32.564
so making it simple and direct.

00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:35.933
It doesn't only benefit
Deaf people well,

00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:38.102
but it will benefit people who speak

00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:40.582
a language other than English.

00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.110
Everyday English is much
more accessible,

00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:49.430
rather than something
that's too highfalutin,

00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:53.978
so making sure that icons are visible

00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:59.157
and having icons alongside text,

00:16:59.758 --> 00:17:03.378
which will depend on your design,

00:17:03.638 --> 00:17:08.433
and just keeping
it in mind is a good thing.

00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:13.572
Also, creating dedicated
Auslan resources

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:16.775
for sections in the website,

00:17:17.008 --> 00:17:20.711
for easy access
to videos and translations

00:17:20.712 --> 00:17:24.715
in Auslan or in sign language,
so Deaf people can then use

00:17:24.716 --> 00:17:28.286
their preferred language
to glean information.

00:17:28.587 --> 00:17:31.523
Ensure that search bars are prominent

00:17:31.823 --> 00:17:37.261
and allow for easy keyword
access to Auslan content,

00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:40.965
because a lot of government
websites or organizations

00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:43.467
in Australia have Auslan videos,

00:17:43.468 --> 00:17:48.308
but people find it very difficult
to find them on the website.

00:17:52.244 --> 00:17:55.247
Having inclusive design practices,

00:17:56.748 --> 00:18:00.551
and there are a number of points,
up on this slide.

00:18:00.552 --> 00:18:03.254
Treating Auslan as a language
that's equal

00:18:03.255 --> 00:18:09.461
to English by not providing
it as an add-on,

00:18:09.895 --> 00:18:11.863
but as core content.

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:18.585
Making sure that all
information is accessible

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:22.506
on an equal basis
to that that's provided in English.

00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:25.510
Using culturally respectful imagery,

00:18:25.777 --> 00:18:29.848
so videos of Deaf people
who have lived experience,

00:18:30.682 --> 00:18:34.252
not always hearing
Auslan interpreters.

00:18:36.054 --> 00:18:39.942
Having those things
displayed is really important.

00:18:41.426 --> 00:18:46.865
Having color contrast,
so large text options,

00:18:47.532 --> 00:18:50.769
and easy-to-read layouts.

00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:57.508
Especially for users
who have additional needs,

00:18:57.509 --> 00:19:01.529
such as visual, sight impairments,

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:04.916
or maybe neurodiversity,

00:19:07.152 --> 00:19:10.454
because bright colors
sometimes can create headaches

00:19:10.455 --> 00:19:13.355
for those people, so being flexible.

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:17.061
Offering content in multiple formats,

00:19:17.062 --> 00:19:21.799
as I said, in Auslan or sign
language video format, English text,

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.604
and Easy English summaries.

00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:30.004
Once you get the hang of it,
it becomes quite easy.

00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:33.812
Collaboration and Training.

00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:37.781
On this slide, there are four points.

00:19:37.782 --> 00:19:40.752
It's good, just as a reminder,

00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:43.922
to have Deaf people as consultants,

00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:48.859
Auslan interpreters,
community organizations,

00:19:50.428 --> 00:19:53.398
through the design
and testing stages.

00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:02.340
Provide training
for WordPress developers

00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:06.211
on Auslan-accessibility
best practices.

00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:11.582
Having a Deaf person

00:20:11.583 --> 00:20:14.985
there is really important
because Deaf people

00:20:14.986 --> 00:20:18.322
can explain the cultural elements

00:20:18.323 --> 00:20:21.793
and the community needs for access,

00:20:22.027 --> 00:20:26.196
which might not be readily
understood by people who don't come

00:20:26.197 --> 00:20:27.877
from the community.

00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:30.267
Having that lived experience

00:20:30.268 --> 00:20:33.283
is really valuable
as part of the team.

00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:38.043
Trying to establish
guidelines for content creators,

00:20:40.078 --> 00:20:44.315
such as how to develop
a script in Auslan,

00:20:44.749 --> 00:20:48.186
to record videos
with Deaf presenters,

00:20:50.889 --> 00:20:55.794
and lastly, hosting regular feedback
sessions with Deaf users.

00:20:57.495 --> 00:21:01.833
That can ensure that continuous
development can occur.

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:11.041
This slide talks about
the Deaf community.

00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:14.344
Often, people wonder,
"What is the Deaf community,

00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:16.576
particularly in Australia?"

00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:21.419
Well, Auslan is short
for "Australian Sign Language."

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.089
It's its own language
with its own structure.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.123
It's very rich.

00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:30.128
It has a history,
and it's a visual language.

00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:33.082
Deaf people use this

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:39.403
because we have visual requirements.

00:21:39.404 --> 00:21:41.913
A lot of Deaf people
are language-deprived

00:21:41.914 --> 00:21:43.708
because of education.

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:45.409
They may have grown up

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:50.448
with very limited signing
or even signed English.

00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:53.751
It's not until they socialize
with other Deaf people

00:21:53.752 --> 00:21:59.758
that they start to learn Auslan,
which is a visual language,

00:22:00.358 --> 00:22:06.664
and can understand language
and communication with intent.

00:22:07.732 --> 00:22:10.467
The Deaf identity
in Australia and Deaf culture

00:22:10.468 --> 00:22:12.497
in Australia is very similar

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:17.342
to Deaf culture
internationally, identity,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.263
and who somebody
is and how they identify.

00:22:22.514 --> 00:22:24.414
Whether they consider themselves

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:28.418
culturally Deaf,
as users of sign language.

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:33.056
They could be signing,
but they might be hard

00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:37.395
of hearing or have lost
their hearing later in life.

00:22:40.465 --> 00:22:43.634
They might be what we would say
"oral Deaf people"

00:22:43.635 --> 00:22:45.969
who learn to lip-read and speak.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:51.127
Some people change their identity
over time as they learn to sign,

00:22:51.209 --> 00:22:56.680
and become what we say is capital
"D" Deaf and are proud of being part

00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:58.499
of the Deaf community.

00:22:59.217 --> 00:23:01.466
Some people have lost their hearing

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:04.788
and do not identify
as culturally Deaf,

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:09.927
using speech, still,
and technology to communicate.

00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:12.729
They might call themselves
"hard of hearing."

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.365
It's important to have eye contact

00:23:15.366 --> 00:23:19.370
with a person
when you are communicating with them,

00:23:20.705 --> 00:23:24.209
making sure that you can enunciate

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:28.008
your words clearly
if they are lip-reading,

00:23:30.114 --> 00:23:34.586
and being able to nod
to show your understanding.

00:23:35.753 --> 00:23:39.022
As I mentioned before,
tapping on the shoulder gently to get

00:23:39.023 --> 00:23:43.460
somebody's attention
if they're facing you, or not,

00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.330
maybe get in front
of their line of sight

00:23:46.331 --> 00:23:49.733
so that you can actually
get their attention,

00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:51.101
but not coming too close.

00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:53.470
That can be considered rude,
and making sure

00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:56.473
that lighting
is clear so that you can see

00:23:56.474 --> 00:23:59.374
each other and it's not distracting.

00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:06.783
Making sure
that you get to the point.

00:24:06.784 --> 00:24:08.943
Deaf people like it
when you get to the point

00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:11.356
and not beat around the bush.

00:24:11.723 --> 00:24:14.024
Also, respect for Deaf elders

00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:17.362
and the history
of the Deaf community.

00:24:17.762 --> 00:24:22.126
There are challenges, however,
in accessing interpreters

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.204
and accessing live captioning
and other communication supports.

00:24:27.205 --> 00:24:31.489
There are interpreter shortages,
there's a high demand,

00:24:31.576 --> 00:24:33.890
and there are cost barriers.

00:24:34.178 --> 00:24:37.114
Sometimes there are booking delays,
and availability

00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:39.925
is a problem getting interpreters.

00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:46.356
Technological accessibility;

00:24:46.357 --> 00:24:48.754
sometimes there are barriers,

00:24:48.927 --> 00:24:52.596
and sometimes people don't know
what needs to be provided.

00:24:52.597 --> 00:24:55.159
They don't have that awareness.

00:24:56.167 --> 00:24:58.569
For an Australian audience,

00:24:58.636 --> 00:25:04.409
we have the National Disability
Insurance Scheme, the NDIS.

00:25:07.979 --> 00:25:10.210
That provides some funding,

00:25:10.615 --> 00:25:14.905
even though it's limited,
for Deaf people.

00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:21.091
The NDIS usually covers
interpreting for social events

00:25:21.092 --> 00:25:25.496
and religious events,
but not for the workplace.

00:25:27.732 --> 00:25:30.668
Funding now is quite limited because,

00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:37.774
beginning last year, in October 2024,
there was a lot of cutbacks

00:25:37.775 --> 00:25:40.337
to the funding that's provided,

00:25:40.778 --> 00:25:43.280
so Deaf people have to budget

00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:46.550
the limited funding
to pay for interpreters,

00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:49.353
and they have to decide
whether they would use

00:25:49.354 --> 00:25:52.222
the interpreting funding for,
say, a medical appointment

00:25:52.223 --> 00:25:56.190
or a social catch-up with family
that may not sign.

00:25:57.662 --> 00:25:59.963
There are interpreter provisions

00:25:59.964 --> 00:26:03.434
through the NDIS, but it's limited,

00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:07.705
and there aren't enough interpreters.

00:26:08.606 --> 00:26:11.375
It's very difficult to become
an interpreter.

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:13.343
You need to learn
the language and then learn

00:26:13.344 --> 00:26:17.314
how to become an interpreter
between the two languages,

00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:21.418
because English and Auslan
are two different languages.

00:26:21.419 --> 00:26:26.023
One's a visual language
and one is an auditory language,

00:26:26.024 --> 00:26:29.693
a sequential language,
so it takes time to develop

00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:32.587
the skill to become an interpreter.

00:26:34.298 --> 00:26:36.700
Next, I wanted to mention the EAF,

00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:39.936
the "Employment
Assistance Fund" in Australia.

00:26:39.937 --> 00:26:42.747
That's provided through JobAccess,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.677
and it's a federally
government-funded department.

00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:49.780
The EAF is for Deaf people

00:26:49.781 --> 00:26:53.917
in the workplace
or have small businesses,

00:26:53.918 --> 00:26:58.356
but again, there is support
available, but it's limited.

00:27:00.725 --> 00:27:03.894
The support is the provision
of an interpreter and costs

00:27:03.895 --> 00:27:07.264
for interpreters,
as well as any technologies,

00:27:07.265 --> 00:27:09.744
as well as video interpreting.

00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:14.838
Also, Auslan training
for staff members

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:19.043
in the workplace
and Deaf cultural training,

00:27:19.343 --> 00:27:21.161
but it can be limited.

00:27:24.115 --> 00:27:28.986
Recently, the government
in Australia has increased

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.459
the funds to around
$12,000 a year, per person,

00:27:35.526 --> 00:27:38.862
but you may have a
professional Deaf person

00:27:38.863 --> 00:27:43.467
working in a business
where meetings are frequent.

00:27:43.468 --> 00:27:48.070
That money is going to run
out within three or four months.

00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:52.309
If you work
in a lower-level position,

00:27:53.277 --> 00:27:57.781
the EAF may be able
to accommodate you for up

00:27:57.782 --> 00:28:03.121
to a year if you only had meetings,
say, monthly.

00:28:05.089 --> 00:28:09.092
If you had fortnightly
or weekly meetings,

00:28:09.093 --> 00:28:12.901
then the funds wouldn't cover
interpreter access,

00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:14.498
and they would then put it back

00:28:14.499 --> 00:28:18.863
on the employer to provide
the funding for interpreting.

00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:23.061
Some organizations do try

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.477
to double-dip using the NDIS,

00:28:27.478 --> 00:28:30.480
but the NDIS is not for that purpose.

00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:34.130
It's a different scheme
to interpreting

00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:37.854
and access in the workplace,
so often,

00:28:37.855 --> 00:28:40.764
businesses need to take
on that responsibility

00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:43.162
to pay for interpreter costs.

00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:48.575
Both the NDIS
and the EAF are all limited

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:51.569
in terms of funding ability,

00:28:51.903 --> 00:28:55.949
and it's funded by taxpayers
throughout the country.

00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:58.795
Just a reminder.

00:28:59.877 --> 00:29:05.917
To improve access
in the workplace and with WordPress,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:11.856
remembering that there's general
principles to follow

00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:17.094
and making sure that WordPress
features are Deaf-friendly,

00:29:18.729 --> 00:29:22.298
making sure that things
are clear on a screen

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:25.314
and sizes are taken
into consideration,

00:29:26.771 --> 00:29:29.594
making sure that community

00:29:29.595 --> 00:29:33.777
is also involved
in that design phase.

00:29:33.778 --> 00:29:36.087
In Australia, often,
Deaf people are asked

00:29:36.088 --> 00:29:41.185
to give feedback
on different WordPress projects

00:29:41.419 --> 00:29:45.148
or on different projects
throughout the country.

00:29:45.957 --> 00:29:50.660
We've celebrated
The Week of Deaf People recently,

00:29:50.661 --> 00:29:53.797
and often, Deaf people
will come to businesses

00:29:53.798 --> 00:29:58.903
and share their knowledge
about Auslan and Deaf culture,

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.915
so that's something to consider.

00:30:07.111 --> 00:30:09.379
The responsibilities of businesses

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:16.287
and institutions is to provide
Deaf-friendly access

00:30:16.988 --> 00:30:19.190
in the WordPress space.

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:26.863
There are legal compliance
requirements in Australia.

00:30:26.864 --> 00:30:31.002
We have the Disability
Discrimination Act of 1991,

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:35.338
and we also have accessibility
standards to ensure

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:37.675
that communication access

00:30:37.975 --> 00:30:41.178
is designed so that it's inclusive.

00:30:42.246 --> 00:30:45.526
Also, again,
mentioning that consultation

00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:48.045
with Deaf people is important,

00:30:48.152 --> 00:30:52.990
and also offering information
in multiple formats.

00:30:56.127 --> 00:31:00.263
Making sure that you have
that intersectionality

00:31:00.264 --> 00:31:04.467
within your consultation
with Deaf people,

00:31:04.468 --> 00:31:08.571
making sure that perhaps
Indigenous Deaf people

00:31:08.572 --> 00:31:14.979
or people of color are also included,
making that available.

00:31:17.415 --> 00:31:20.183
Also, making sure
that Deaf people are paid

00:31:20.184 --> 00:31:23.486
for their time
if they do consult with you.

00:31:23.487 --> 00:31:29.559
My experience over the last
15 years has been quite extensive,

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.228
and I've had a lot of organizations,

00:31:32.229 --> 00:31:35.198
government, as well as private,
asking me to volunteer

00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:40.171
my time to provide consultancy work,

00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:42.572
and sometimes, they'll just pay

00:31:42.573 --> 00:31:47.877
for your lunch
or a very small remuneration.

00:31:48.212 --> 00:31:49.713
It's important that Deaf people

00:31:49.714 --> 00:31:52.549
are recognized
for the time that they give,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.983
especially if they've got to travel

00:31:53.984 --> 00:31:58.389
to your office or meet
with you over Zoom.

00:32:01.325 --> 00:32:02.860
Deaf people,

00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:08.632
I guess, can't be considered
cheap labor and exploited.

00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:11.801
People with disabilities
generally deserve

00:32:11.802 --> 00:32:17.775
to have real recognition
for the skills, expertise,

00:32:17.908 --> 00:32:21.796
and effort that they bring
to support your project

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:29.754
and any activities
that you might do with WordPress.

00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:34.116
In summary, just a reminder here,

00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:38.462
be aware of the Disability
Discrimination Act.

00:32:39.263 --> 00:32:42.265
You can find all of that information

00:32:42.266 --> 00:32:47.938
by Googling it or asking
a Deaf person for more information.

00:32:49.373 --> 00:32:52.041
Making sure that when you consult

00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:54.577
with Deaf people,
you make sure that you think about

00:32:54.578 --> 00:32:56.780
all of the different
accessibility needs,

00:32:56.781 --> 00:33:01.050
because not all services

00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:04.254
might be the right skill
set that you require,

00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:07.524
so getting that expertise
from Deaf people

00:33:07.525 --> 00:33:09.959
with lived experience,
because they often

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.274
are the ones that know best.

00:33:14.398 --> 00:33:16.800
Deaf people will give
you their preferences,

00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:19.490
especially about
particular interpreters

00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.272
that might be used.

00:33:23.274 --> 00:33:28.412
Not all interpreters will be suitable
for all different things,

00:33:29.313 --> 00:33:31.348
so we need to make sure

00:33:31.878 --> 00:33:38.878
that we incorporate
the styles that are suitable

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.452
in the interpreting profession.

00:33:46.697 --> 00:33:51.401
We need to make sure that Deaf people
are paid for their time,

00:33:51.402 --> 00:33:54.893
as I mentioned before,
in the design process.

00:33:56.073 --> 00:33:59.342
Making sure that fonts
and the font sizes

00:33:59.343 --> 00:34:03.313
and pictures are used,
and easy English is used,

00:34:03.314 --> 00:34:07.750
and things are not too wordy,
because it's very difficult to get

00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:11.083
the Deaf person
to engage when that occurs.

00:34:13.257 --> 00:34:15.592
Making sure that picture-in-picture

00:34:15.593 --> 00:34:18.072
format for Auslan interpreters

00:34:19.396 --> 00:34:24.000
and also into spoken
English from Auslan,

00:34:24.001 --> 00:34:26.403
the translations are there,

00:34:27.872 --> 00:34:30.975
and also the text
translations as well,

00:34:31.108 --> 00:34:33.543
so that Deafblind interpreters

00:34:33.544 --> 00:34:37.014
are able to access that information.

00:34:37.648 --> 00:34:41.851
They may be tactile signing,
which is hand-on-hand signing.

00:34:41.852 --> 00:34:46.057
There could be a whole
list of different requirements.

00:34:47.525 --> 00:34:50.627
At the bottom of this slide,
that is our Deaf flag,

00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:55.732
and we're very proud to have a flag
that represents Deaf people

00:34:55.733 --> 00:34:59.859
that was put out
by the World Federation of the Deaf.

00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:04.041
These are national
resources now on this slide

00:35:04.301 --> 00:35:07.711
that you can perhaps
have a look at later.

00:35:10.214 --> 00:35:12.611
These are my contact details.

00:35:12.683 --> 00:35:16.174
You can contact me
via text message or email,

00:35:16.887 --> 00:35:18.788
Facebook, or LinkedIn,

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:23.126
and because this is
an international audience,

00:35:23.127 --> 00:35:29.066
don't forget to use the +61
for the mobile text messaging.

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:37.752
If you're wanting to learn
the sign for thank you, it is this.

00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:39.740
[signs "thank you"]

00:35:39.741 --> 00:35:40.878
Thank you.

00:35:43.347 --> 00:35:45.682
If you write with your right hand,

00:35:45.683 --> 00:35:47.850
you use your right hand
as your dominant hand.

00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:49.953
If you write with your left hand,

00:35:49.954 --> 00:35:53.604
it is your left hand
that's your dominant hand.

00:35:54.892 --> 00:35:56.926
That's how we teach finger spelling.

00:35:56.927 --> 00:35:58.963
One hand is dominant,

00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:03.271
depending on whether you're left
or right-handed.

00:36:03.634 --> 00:36:07.522
Now we'll move
to the question-and-answer session.

00:36:07.605 --> 00:36:08.993
Thank you all.

00:36:09.115 --> 00:36:10.115
Bye-bye.

00:36:13.649 --> 00:36:14.279
Alicia: Okay.

00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:16.679
That was absolutely mesmerizing.

00:36:17.849 --> 00:36:19.379
Thank you so much,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.699
Shawn, for that presentation,
and I just want to say a few things.

00:36:23.789 --> 00:36:27.900
I don't think
everyone who's here knows that there's

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.500
a tin-can translation happening here.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.617
He's speaking Auslan,

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:37.499
or he's actually signing Auslan
while someone else is translating it

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.040
to American Sign Language,
while someone else is translating

00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:42.419
that to vocal

00:36:43.084 --> 00:36:44.084
that we heard.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:48.899
It was the first time in my experience
that I've seen this sign language first

00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:50.329
and the voice coming second.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.669
I don't know if anybody got
the emphasis of that,

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.689
but it was very different,

00:36:54.689 --> 00:36:55.689
very unique,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.953
and thank you so much for sharing this,

00:36:57.954 --> 00:36:59.503
Shawn. I really appreciate it.

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:02.460
We do have questions.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:08.969
Shawn jumped on these questions,
and so I'm going to read out his answers

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.950
because not everyone
can see the answer.

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:13.033
I'm going to go ahead.

00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:19.830
The one that we all immediately had
a question was when you said

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.900
it's two-handed signing.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.229
Right away, Amy was on this one.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.240
I'm curious about how folks who use
two-handed finger spelling adapt

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.150
when they have limb differences
or an injury preventing

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.379
the use of two hands,

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:38.700
and the answer is really intriguing.

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:42.749
It was, yes, in Australia,
it is called phantom signing

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.880
or phantom one-hand signing adapted
from Auslan two-hand signing.

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.070
Not all Auslan deaf signers

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:57.059
or Auslan interpreters understand
that approach unless it's taught at school

00:37:57.299 --> 00:38:00.659
or TAFE's vocational colleges.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.929
TAFE means Technical
and Further Education.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.300
Thank you for explaining that stuff, too,
because I know a lot of the acronyms

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.609
in different countries.

00:38:09.006 --> 00:38:13.590
There was more Q&A in here.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.339
How many sign languages do deaf people--
Speaker 1: Hey, Alicia?

00:38:16.339 --> 00:38:17.339
Alicia: Yes?

00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:20.008
Speaker 1: Can you ask
Shawn the questions?

00:38:20.009 --> 00:38:21.709
It looks like he wants to respond.

00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:25.229
Alicia: Oh, okay.
Do you want to add more to that, Shawn?

00:38:27.094 --> 00:38:29.250
Shawn: I will add to that.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.004
Just to answer that question
a little bit further,

00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:35.279
hearing and deaf people

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.365
that may have cerebral palsy
or other additional disabilities or needs,

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:47.447
perhaps they may have had a stroke
or they may have paralysis in their arm

00:38:47.657 --> 00:38:51.210
where they are unable to use
that two-handed finger spelling.

00:38:51.836 --> 00:38:55.199
What they might do is they would use
their dominant hand or the hand

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.939
that they are still able to function with,
and people would have those skills

00:39:00.659 --> 00:39:06.929
to be able to use that finger spelling,
and just imagining

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.870
that the non-dominant hand is still there.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.799
Then people may learn
through TAFE, universities,

00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:15.309
schools,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.110
just how to understand
those finger spellings.

00:39:19.303 --> 00:39:22.167
For example,
if I was to spell the word night,

00:39:22.249 --> 00:39:27.077
N-I-G-H-T, and if I look
at that in the dictionary,

00:39:27.227 --> 00:39:30.884
the sign for that is like this,
where the one hand moves

00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:32.099
horizontally down.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.298
It's usually a two-handed sign,
but for example,

00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:40.559
if I only had the one hand,
I could just use the one hand

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:43.979
to sign that, and that is quite flexible.

00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:48.390
Another sign, for example,

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.850
computer, you can see
that's a two-handed sign,

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.589
but if you were only able to use one hand,
you could still use that dominant hand

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.170
to move, to show
the parameters of that sign,

00:39:58.344 --> 00:40:00.329
such as the movement, the hand shape.

00:40:01.155 --> 00:40:05.999
It's similar to how people
who may not be able to use their voice

00:40:06.059 --> 00:40:10.319
to pronounce all their words,
but for deaf people,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:15.089
they may be able to use those lip patterns
and lip cues alongside that hand

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.800
that is still in dominant use.

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:19.260
We do call that phantom signing.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.960
I don't know a whole lot about that.

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.450
I didn't grow up learning
about that in school,

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:27.229
until I went to TAFE,

00:40:27.389 --> 00:40:29.819
which is that Tertiary
and Further Education.

00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:34.439
When that happened or in college,

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:37.799
that's when the teacher
taught me about that.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.159
That was when I understood
a little bit more,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:45.329
but there are many young deaf people
in Australia that would not know so much

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.710
about phantom signing.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.020
Alicia: Wow.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.340
Okay.

00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:52.840
I'm going to let you go
for the other one too, Shawn.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:41:00.359
You had, how many sign languages
do deaf people learn and use in the USA,

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.039
in UK, and Australia?

00:41:02.189 --> 00:41:03.189
Shawn,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.520
you answered that before,
but go ahead and answer for everyone,

00:41:08.159 --> 00:41:09.159
if you would like.

00:41:10.379 --> 00:41:11.489
Shawn: Yes, certainly.

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:15.030
Just letting you know
that the World Federation for the Deaf,

00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:24.441
so that's the WFD,
the World Federation,

00:41:24.498 --> 00:41:25.668
sorry, of the Deaf,

00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:28.541
so there are many sign languages
in the world,

00:41:28.591 --> 00:41:36.303
over 400 different sign languages
that we have.

00:41:38.527 --> 00:41:40.395
With the people

00:41:40.427 --> 00:41:45.810
who are deaf and hard of hearing,
not everybody would use a sign language.

00:41:46.819 --> 00:41:50.979
There are also deaf-blind communities
who would use hand-over-hand

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:52.559
or tactile signing,

00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:57.750
and so there are
many deaf people in Australia,

00:41:57.836 --> 00:42:00.779
New Zealand, in Europe,
in England, America,

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.839
who would all use
different sign languages.

00:42:03.929 --> 00:42:07.253
There isn't a universal sign language
across the world.

00:42:08.939 --> 00:42:13.158
There are many people who believe
that Auslan is the same as ASL,

00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:15.060
which is American Sign Language,

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.770
but no, as you can see,
one of those differences,

00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:21.210
for an example, is what.

00:42:21.269 --> 00:42:24.514
This is a sign
for what in Auslan, but in ASL,

00:42:24.515 --> 00:42:25.920
American Sign Language,

00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:30.958
the sign for what actually
means where in Auslan.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.550
The same sign

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.570
means a completely different thing
in the different language.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.419
If we were signing,

00:42:39.889 --> 00:42:41.899
"Where's your this?"

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:45.478
sometimes we get confused
as Australian people reading

00:42:45.479 --> 00:42:47.779
that sign language to say,
"Where's your what?"

00:42:48.259 --> 00:42:49.680
which is quite tricky.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.989
In Auslan, this is the sign for where,
which is different

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.423
from the American sign,

00:42:55.483 --> 00:42:57.933
which looks like the Australian
sign for what,

00:42:58.013 --> 00:43:00.750
so that does get quite confusing.

00:43:02.969 --> 00:43:06.570
The audience who lives in the UK,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.648
there are also a bit of a funny story
or a funny sign,

00:43:10.649 --> 00:43:15.120
I'll keep it professional,
but the sign for Coke,

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.950
C-O-K-E,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.219
in the context of a drink,
is the sign for this.

00:43:20.669 --> 00:43:25.378
Whereas in BSL Sign Language,
deaf people could be quite offended

00:43:25.379 --> 00:43:29.100
when they see that,
because that sign would mean sex.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:39.719
There are different signs
between Auslan and other sign languages,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:44.643
also the different hand shapes
that can be considered quite rude as well.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.579
That hand shape there
with the middle finger raised is

00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:49.830
the Japanese sign for brother.

00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:53.968
Whereas in our culture and context,
we would consider that handshake

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:57.030
to be quite rude if we were sticking up
the middle finger.

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:02.580
Considering that,

00:44:03.534 --> 00:44:07.139
the different states
in Australia also have some variation.

00:44:07.768 --> 00:44:10.979
Between Queensland,
New South Wales, ACT,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.979
Victoria, Western Australia,
South Australia,

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:15.750
we have what's called

00:44:17.344 --> 00:44:18.682
regional dialects.

00:44:19.044 --> 00:44:21.706
In Queensland,
the sign for hungry is this,

00:44:21.757 --> 00:44:23.857
where the hands fall down
from the stomach,

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:28.409
but in Melbourne and in Victoria,
the sign for hungry is that,

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.460
the thumb brushing downwards on the neck.

00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:34.739
If a person from Melbourne goes
to Brisbane for a holiday

00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:38.494
and they were to meet somebody from there
and they signed that hungry with the thumb

00:44:38.494 --> 00:44:39.494
on the neck,

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.810
the Queensland deaf people,
or who interpret that,

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.890
might be quite offended because that sign
is also the sign for sex.

00:44:49.022 --> 00:44:54.660
That's the sign for sex in Queensland,
whereas it's the sign for hungry.

00:44:54.809 --> 00:45:00.299
For example, when we say Hungry Jack's
in Queensland and we sign that,

00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:01.941
we say, "Oh, does that mean--

00:45:01.968 --> 00:45:04.471
are you saying Jack is sexy?"

00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:07.979
Queensland people who are signing,

00:45:09.449 --> 00:45:12.989
and another example for coffee,
this is the sign for coffee.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.440
When you come down
to Melbourne and you sign that,

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:18.329
that's actually talking about a car.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.593
It does look like
when you're winding up the car,

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.913
so you do have to be careful
when you are learning Auslan.

00:45:30.209 --> 00:45:33.750
It's better to learn the dialect
that's within your state,

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.360
but just to be aware
that there are differences

00:45:36.389 --> 00:45:38.100
all across Australia.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.439
I heard that in America, this sign

00:45:44.489 --> 00:45:49.739
on your heart is also quite similar
to another sign for assume

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.019
or an accent.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.230
I believe that within Australian cities
and countries,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.279
also within the Indigenous Australians.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.430
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.

00:46:05.585 --> 00:46:06.671
Speaker 3: I'm so sorry.

00:46:06.671 --> 00:46:11.640
We want to make sure we are respectful
of all of our sign language interpreters.

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:15.119
Thank you all so much
for this amazing session.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.250
Alicia: It's amazing.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.315
Speaker 3: All right.
We will see you all-

00:46:19.315 --> 00:46:20.615
Shawn: Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:22.465
Speaker 3: -in the very next session.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.830
Thank you.

00:46:25.049 --> 00:46:26.699
Alicia: Okay, thank you.
