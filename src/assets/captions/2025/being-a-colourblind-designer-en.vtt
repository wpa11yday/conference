<v Matt Roberts> Hello.
Nice to meet you.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.709
My name is Matt Roberts,
and today I'm going to be talking

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.520
about being a colourblind designer.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.369
Comes in three parts.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.099
I'm going to start
by really explaining

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.459
what colour blindness is,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.439
then I'm going to talk about
what it's like being colourblind,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.399
and then ultimately
building that bigger picture

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.109
about what it's like to be
a colourblind designer.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.210
A quick intro to me first,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.530
putting job titles
and everything aside,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.634
I care about making
people feel included.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.173
I do that in a few ways.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.726
I'm an accessibility advocate,
I'm a public speaker.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.239
I'm a writer.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.830
I co-chair a Inclusive Design
Council here in the UK.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.009
I also do a lot of design judging,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.179
so ensuring that conversations
on inclusion and accessibility

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.907
are part of the judging criteria.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.520
And I'm also a senior user
experience designer.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.062
Part one: Colour blindness.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.827
So, what is colour blindness,
or colour vision deficiency?

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.709
This is taken directly from
a dictionary: colour blindness, a noun,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.677
is the inability to distinguish
certain colours, or,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.000
rarely in humans, any colours at all.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.519
In terms of testing
for colour blindness,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.920
it's often used is this test
called the Ishihara test,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.036
and it's a collection
of coloured dots.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.810
Within those dots is a number that,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.379
if you are colourblind,
it's difficult to see,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.182
but if you're not colourblind,

00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:38.729
you can see those numbers
straight away.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.420
This test was created in 1917
by a Japanese ophthalmologist,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.799
Dr. Shinobu Ishihara,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.450
to screen military
recruits for colour blindness.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.080
Here's an example.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.978
I'll put it to you.

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.830
What number is this?

00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:07.000
Is it A) 21, B) 74, or even,
"There's a number, question mark"?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.460
What do we think?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.020
It's actually 74.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.939
Now, I say "actually",
because I can't see that number.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.059
Now, I have absolutely
double-checked,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.639
triple-checked that
that definitely says 74.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.619
So, if it doesn't, please let me know,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.222
and I will let the person know
that they've stitched me up.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.059
There are three types
of colour blindness.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.472
There is protanopia,
which is red blindness.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.189
Excuse my pronunciations.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.220
Deuteranopia, green blindness.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.300
And there's tritanopia,
which is blue-yellow blindness.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.479
These are the three main
types of colour blindness.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.289
There are a few more,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.654
but those are the three
that are typically spoken about.

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:00.313
For me, I am the first two,

00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:06.180
protanopia and deuteranopia,
which is reds and greens.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.979
I find that incredibly
difficult around Christmas time.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.502
Lots of things are red and green,
a combination of things.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.220
Yes, for me,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.979
red and greens are the most
difficult colours for me to see.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.344
I'll go on to explain a bit
more about that as we go on.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.419
Is colour blindness hereditary?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.419
It is.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.679
This is something that I found
out fairly recently after doing

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.729
a bit more digging and a bit
more research into this condition.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.509
It's actually one

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.681
of the world's most common
genetic inherited conditions,

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:47.570
which means usually passed
down from your parents.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.197
Can it be fixed?

00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:55.645
Always an interesting term, fixed.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.999
I don't typically
like it in reference

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.570
to conditions
and personal circumstance.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.593
But in this case, can
colour blindness be fixed?

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.519
Sort of, I think
is probably fair to say.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.040
There's manufacturers, similar
to the example I've got on screen.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.009
This is from EnChroma.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.719
These are EnChroma glasses.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.365
They've got a tint on the lenses

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.190
to essentially enhance
the colours that you see.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.300
Imagine if you made
everything glossy and laminated,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.487
the colours tend to be a little
bit brighter, a little bit sharper.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.686
I've got a pair of these. They...

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.559
I wouldn't say they work in terms
of correcting colour blindness.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.889
So I couldn't say, for example,
going back to that Ishihara test,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.653
I wouldn't say that if I put those
on, I could then see the number 74.

00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:59.759
But what I could say
is that they'd make those colours

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.578
a little bit brighter.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.819
I'd be interested to know

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.390
if you ever tried
these and they work for you.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.870
But for me, they don't work.

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:14.639
But it could be an option
for you if you wanted

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.528
to try and see colours
a little bit more vibrantly.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.789
In terms of how many people,
how common is it to be colourblind?

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.940
A little question again to you.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:37.260
Do you think it's 1 in 12,
1 in 200 people, or 1 in 1,000?

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.100
That's 1 in 12,
1 in 200, or 1 in 1,000.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:53.779
It's actually both A and B, A being 1 in 12,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.408
and that refers to the amount
of men that are colourblind, and B,

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:02.410
1 in 200, that's 1 in 200
women are colourblind.

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.437
So, a lot more common
in men, but overall,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.396
perhaps more common than you thought.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.539
In terms of stats,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.159
talking today all about
on WordPress Accessibility Day,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.780
so I found this stat about WordPress.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.609
Just to give these numbers
a bit of context,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.340
so 409 million people
view a WordPress every day.

00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:32.699
It's a statistic I found,
which equates

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.619
to statistically 34 million
male visitors are colourblind,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.278
and 2 million female
visitors are colourblind.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.980
Statistically speaking,
that is quite a few.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.928
Taking those numbers, particularly
in terms of WordPress as well.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.574
What's it like being colourblind?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.549
In this part, I'd really prompt you,
I've made myself a note there,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.029
is for you to ask questions,
pop them in the chat,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.940
and I'll answer as many as possible.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.789
It's always quite interesting
with sessions like this,

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.410
where I'm trying to summarise
as many lived experiences

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.159
as possible to help
you in whatever line

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.939
of work you're involved in,
personally or professionally.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.019
If there are any specific questions
you've got for me, please ask.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.199
I'm going to go over the top
four or five questions

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.674
that I typically get asked, but if
there's some extras, please do ask.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.519
There's a big word there, ask.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.884
Honestly, I will be more
than happy to answer,

00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:48.282
like I say, as much as I can.

00:10:49.631 --> 00:10:54.960
The most common question
I get asked is, what colour is grass?

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.385
This is pretty much
the first question,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.229
hence me putting that question one,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.435
that I get asked as soon
as I say that I'm colourblind.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.650
For me, grass is green.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.119
It is my green.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.929
It may be slightly different
to your green, but absolutely,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.370
it is green.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.109
The bit that I would struggle

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.160
with in terms of grass
being the context is, say,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.700
finding a cricket ball,
so typically a red leather ball.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.108
I'd find that quite difficult
to spot on a field.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.499
It is all about, again,

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.519
using Ishihara test
as a really good example.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.979
It's where colours
are very close to each other,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.559
and it's very difficult for me
to differentiate

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.159
one colour from another,
to pull out that thing.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.579
In terms of a cricket
ball being red amongst

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.289
a field of green,
it would be quite difficult

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.687
for me to find that red ball.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.239
Please, if you play cricket
with me, be patient.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.559
I will find the ball eventually,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.360
but that is the scenario,
for me at least.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.920
Question two that I get asked a lot
is, what colour are traffic lights?

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.500
I see, again, what most people see.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.029
This is, again,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.770
related to the overlapping
or the separation of colours.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.159
The traffic lights
are clearly separate,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.959
particularly here in the UK.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.509
The top one is red,
and there's a middle one

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.689
in a vertical line,
a middle one that is amber or yellow,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.004
and the bottom one is green.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.790
I can see all those colours
as much as anybody.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.699
I haven't got
any points on my licence.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.050
We are all good, but yes,
I see those, for me,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.230
in the correct way of red,
amber, and green,

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.979
even though I am
red-green colourblind.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.468
Question three.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.099
What colour is this?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.500
Yes.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.010
This is very, very common.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.680
So when talking about colour blindness,
I often then get--

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.199
Somebody will just
point at something.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.167
It could be on screen,
it could be wherever we are.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.299
And it's interesting, right?

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.819
Like, somebody tells you they're
seeing something slightly different,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.311
potentially from yourself,
you're interested.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.740
Part three.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.669
We've learnt about
colour blindness, how common it is,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.570
how it's tested, if it's hereditary.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.909
We've looked at some
of the key questions

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.292
that I get asked,
and if I haven't covered

00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:55.350
those in your question,
please do ask.

00:13:56.228 --> 00:14:01.200
It could be anything
from what's it like playing snooker,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.029
and playing various sports,
to shopping, to whatever it might be.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.418
Please do ask.

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:09.579
Now I'm going to talk about

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.849
what it's like not only
being colourblind,

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.560
but colourblind in a visual
profession, so being a designer.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.870
It's a very obvious question,
but most people will say, "How?

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.090
How do you do that?"

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.575
It's fairly easy,
and I'll explain why.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:41.529
Imagine an older person
designing a walking aid,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.110
or a one-handed person
designing shoes,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.390
or a deaf person
designing a music venue.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.951
There's a common theme.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:01.076
They are inherently
designing with lived experience.

00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:03.023
Let me go back.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.729
Imagine, let's say, an older
person designing a walking aid.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:14.550
They have a huge amount of experience
of knowing what barriers

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.496
and what frustrations
they often have,

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.489
as well as what actually works well.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.390
So, whether going to the local shops,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.729
getting on transport,
whatever it might be,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.623
they know what works best for them,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.819
and they also know
where the biggest frustrations are.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.994
It could be
in the material, the weights,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.389
the ability to make it smaller

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.026
and compact while they're on busier
transport, whatever it might be.

00:15:47.027 --> 00:15:50.820
It's the same with the other
examples there.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.026
A one-handed person
designing shoes will consider it,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.099
consider the mechanisms,
and things like that,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.836
in a more useful way.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.869
Same with a deaf person
designing a music venue.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.819
All designing with years
and years of experience.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.713
It's the same for me as a designer.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.969
So, the five benefits of being

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.461
a colourblind designer
is that I'm designing--

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.609
That sounded like I'm
the next Marvel character.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.129
I design with a built-in filter,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.444
so I will never design anything

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.990
that somebody who's
colourblind cannot see,

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.120
because I can't design what
I can't see, if that makes sense.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.870
So that's a real huge,
huge benefit that I do have.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.990
I'll cover an example in a second.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.129
Another of the benefits
is that I'm a designer with empathy.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.940
I understand, to a certain extent,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.200
what it's like to feel
excluded by the design,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.240
the presentation, the whatever it is
might be in front of me.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.350
So when I am working on projects,
I am that voice--

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.439
and touches on the third point,
I am that voice

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.230
about who this design
might exclude in some way.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.139
Obviously, coming
from colour blindness,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.504
I can talk about that.

00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:24.719
There's lots of other aspects

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.109
that I can start to introduce
to that conversation,

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.089
to really make sure that that design,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:36.180
that presentation, whatever,
will land and be representative

00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:41.580
of more people,
and not make anybody feel

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.409
excluded from that experience.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.010
Of course, I can answer
colour-related questions.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.773
Design is typically quite a visual,

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.315
and particularly graphic
design and web design things.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.979
I answer very regularly what works

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.880
and what doesn't work
for colour-related scenarios.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.359
Finally, I can develop
lots of teams' assumptions

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.380
around what colour blindness is,
and what it isn't.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.631
And that's a really healthy
conversation to have.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.259
It doesn't mean that everything

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.359
has to be very stripped
back and plain.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.859
There's lots of things you can do

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.989
with a real variety of bright,
bold colours, and very pastel colours.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.439
It's just the combination
that can make things

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.589
a little bit more trickier

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.132
for someone who's colourblind
to engage with.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.110
Here's the example
where I talk about designing

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.414
with that kind of built-in
feature, so to speak.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.819
This is a real example.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.079
This is something I came
across a few months ago.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.981
This is a captcha form.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.153
Signing into a particular platform,

00:19:01.154 --> 00:19:05.909
you'll know that every now and again,
you'll get this captcha

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.846
form to make sure you're not a robot.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:15.579
And this one is incredibly complicated,

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.760
beyond, if not impossible.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:25.350
This really was quite a moment
to see whether, actually,

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.149
is it that being colourblind
is really impacting the way of trying

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.890
to log into this platform,
or is it generally possible?

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.119
Looking at the right-hand side,
there, at the example,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.239
there's so many colours
that are interacting with each other.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.890
They're layered on each other.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.209
There's three examples
across the top,

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.550
and the first and the third
are just full of these speckled dots.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.919
Now I'm thinking,
as someone who's colourblind,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.629
who's quite aware of the Ishihara
test, I'm thinking,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.130
is it one of those scenarios
where I can't see

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:11.340
the answer to progress
through and log on to the platform?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.369
I had to reset it.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:20.219
I had to go through

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.259
quite a few before getting

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.379
to a scenario where I could actually
log into this platform.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.273
It was quite a well-known platform.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.380
If I was then part of the design
team at that particular company,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.739
I wouldn't be designing
things like this.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.469
Maybe many of you wouldn't do something so complex.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.349
This was really an example

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.659
where if there was somebody
who was colourblind

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.310
in the room of creating
interactions like this,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.639
it would be a voice of saying,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.519
"If you cannot see the colour,
can you still answer

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.328
the question in order
to log in to the platform?"

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.288
Yes, captcha inputs
obviously need to be complex, but

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.880
for me, that was definitely
an impossible task.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.199
So there's four common frustrations.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.639
There's a little bit
of frustration there,

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.146
as you can tell, on the captcha.

00:21:20.147 --> 00:21:22.957
But there are four common frustrations

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.813
I get as a colourblind designer
on a fairly regular basis,

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.790
and the first one being, "See corrections in red".

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.580
Red, obviously, synonymous
with error or wrong.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.099
That is typically seen
within documents and emails,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.836
and things like that.

00:21:42.837 --> 00:21:46.303
Well, if I can't see red,
I'm going to struggle.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.159
People that are colourblind,
going back to those numbers,

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.080
1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.040
have a vision
deficiency of some sort.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.359
That is a massive frustration.

00:22:00.615 --> 00:22:04.049
I'll talk about a solution
to that in a moment,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:10.470
but that is absolutely one of the top
frustrations that I do have.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.703
Another frustration
is around comments

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.919
like "it's not that serious,
colour blindness".

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.340
There's a huge spectrum of visual
impairments, of course there is,

00:22:24.236 --> 00:22:27.251
but colour blindness
is still fairly serious.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.139
We've already spoken
about the seriousness

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.867
of it from a medical perspective.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.619
It shouldn't be put
to a not serious category,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.900
because absolutely it is.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:46.650
There's also these
passive-aggressive comments,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.216
"Are you colourblind?"

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.629
felt like in a,
not passive-aggressive,

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.940
but a derogatory manner.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.119
Yes, I am colourblind.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.919
Let's talk about it.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.599
Let's not put the emphasis
on you can't do that,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.869
but let's have a conversation
to really progress

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.202
this conversation
in a really positive way.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.279
And fourthly, "As you can see
from this graph...",

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.216
again I'll touch on a solution in a moment,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.330
but regardless of what
profession you are in,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.460
you will see a profit and loss chart,

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.880
you will see what's working
well, you'll see it on product

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:36.359
specifications type of pages,
and things like what's good and bad,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.709
and where the distribution of your
audience and things like that is.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:45.340
Often, there's a lot of colour,
and they are in, again,

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.433
very close proximity of each other.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.019
Again, with the green being
positive and red being negative,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.909
if you can't see those differences,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.274
you don't know whether you're doing
well or not so well.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.140
That is an absolute frustration.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.450
It's incredibly, incredibly common.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:14.009
So, what can you do with these, particularly
these four frustrations? Firstly,

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.820
with the "See corrections in red,"

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:21.720
please, please do annotate
documents for corrections.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.939
Pretty much every tool
that I've come across and I use now,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:32.920
there is a highlight
and comment on it, and a feature

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.047
then to highlight it and put
the comment elsewhere.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.859
That's been
an incredible game-changer

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.949
in terms of being able
to contribute to that,

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.039
that business case,
that document, that report,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.459
whatever it might be,
because it's so much easier now

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.239
to be able to spot
those areas and corrections

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.652
of what I've been tasked
to do or to review.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.329
Secondly, the frustration
with "It's not that serious"

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:08.279
is around challenging
your assumption,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.460
our assumptions of what
different conditions are,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.699
so you're not put in that situation

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.130
where you're incorrect,
you're quite well educated,

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.429
and you're interested in knowing

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:28.079
what the different visual impairments

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.340
in this case are like
and how that can impact

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.290
a particular experience
that you're in.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.010
Thirdly, the frustrations
around the derogatory,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.968
quite negative terms
around "Are you colourblind?"

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.819
Build an inclusive environment,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.089
build an environment
within your workplace,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.869
personally or professionally,
about open conversation

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.619
and progressive conversation around

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.899
just understanding it as having

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.180
real interesting conversations

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.579
where you can understand

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.099
and know where the frustrations
might be and where the solutions

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.899
and innovation
might come from as well.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.309
I haven't really spoken too much
about innovation, but I think

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.889
it's incredibly important when
we're talking about accessibility

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.820
is to really acknowledge, not things

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.109
are a barrier and everything
needs to be stripped back

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.139
and simple and plain and boring
and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.391
See it as an opportunity
to be innovative and provide

00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:40.797
a solution to make more
and more people feel included,

00:26:40.988 --> 00:26:46.224
and colour blindness being absolutely
part of that conversation, too.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.862
Then lastly, "As you
can see from the graph...",

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.159
there are quite a few solutions.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.569
I've put one on screen here.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.720
This is avoid relying on colour alone.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.296
As I mentioned, red is often
seen as negative or no,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.327
and green is yes, pass, whatever.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.400
A good way to solve this,
can't really,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.210
in some instances,
get away from those colours,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.379
is perhaps use a patterned
red against a solid green.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.039
That way,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.519
regardless of what colours people

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.829
can and cannot see, you are noticing

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.797
the difference between a pattern
and a solid colour.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.499
It's a useful thing to think about
when you are designing something.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.155
Say, imagine that screen
in greyscale.

00:27:39.156 --> 00:27:40.949
Take all the colour out of it.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:46.199
Can you see the difference

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.850
in the graph of what it's
trying to illustrate?

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.269
The other ones,

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:56.580
the other way we can do it
is around better labelling,

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:02.009
really be better with our legends
and things like that,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.899
make them more visible,
making the spaces,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.260
the bar graphs much bigger,

00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:10.339
so there's a bigger volume
of colour on screen,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.180
but also simple labels,
lines to what you're talking about,

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.849
and being aware of it as a presenter,

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.679
talking through what is presented
on screen rather than relying

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.189
on the ability
of everybody's being able

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.899
to differentiate those colours.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.517
Again, those numbers
of 1 in 12 and 1 in 200.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.852
If you think about
the size of your company

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.422
and your customer base,
that's a huge amount of audiences,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.862
a huge amount of people
that are statistically colourblind.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.722
Before I go, a couple of little true

00:28:51.723 --> 00:28:58.589
or false facts about colour blindness.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.410
True or false, women can
see more colours than men.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.910
What do you think to this?

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.380
We talk about 1 in 12 men
being colourblind,

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.149
1 in 200 women being colourblind,

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.020
but can women see
more colours than men?

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.040
That is true.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.378
Some women can actually
see more colours than men.

00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:32.759
It's about 12% of women
carry a genetic variation

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.249
that could allow them
to be tetrachromats,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.931
meaning they may perceive
millions more colours than average.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.333
Super, super interested.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.339
I'm not a scientist.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.739
Like I say, I'm not a doctor,
but I would love to investigate

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.990
that much further than I have
already into understanding how,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.810
why women can see more colours,
and what colours they might be.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.134
If anybody's got an answer,
again, pop it in the chat.

00:30:00.135 --> 00:30:04.023
Really keen to understand
more about this as well.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.870
True or false, monkeys
have been cured of colour blindness.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.459
A weird thing.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.579
True or false?

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.833
Have monkeys been cured
of colour blindness?

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.839
It is true.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.490
Hence, the shocked
monkey face there on screen.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.857
In 2009, there was an experiment.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.719
Scientists successfully introduced
a gene into squirrel monkeys

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.499
that allowed them to see red
and green for the first time,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.594
essentially curing
their colour blindness.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.659
How?

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.660
Why?

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.159
I don't know.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.529
But that was a super interesting
fact about colour blindness

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.660
that I thought I'd share today.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.499
Finally, following on from
that animal theme, true or false,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.220
horses have been "cured"
of colour blindness.

00:31:03.337 --> 00:31:05.017
What do we think?

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.930
Monkeys have.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.900
Have horses?

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.545
Again, inverted commas on cured.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.500
That is false.

00:31:16.506 --> 00:31:19.889
Horses haven't been cured
of colour blindness.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.826
Really, you thought it could be true.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.659
This is really all being part

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:29.039
of this conversation today about
challenging people's assumptions

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.739
and seeing where we can improve
our understanding

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.499
of what colour blindness is,
what we can do day to day,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.499
answer some of those key questions

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.359
that you may have been having
in the back of your mind.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.631
I'm incredibly, incredibly
open about what colour blindness

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.929
experience has been for myself.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.679
Again, if there's any questions,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.170
I will do my best to answer
those in the chat.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.419
Lastly, a summary.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:08.130
Yes, colour blindness is much
more common than you might think.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.290
Yes, it can be incredibly serious.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.730
And no, there's no cure
for colourblind horses yet.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:25.589
Thank you so much for listening
to me today, to investing

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.922
in understanding
more about colour blindness,

00:32:28.923 --> 00:32:31.709
being colourblind and being
a colourblind designer as well.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.899
I hope it helps you, helps your team,

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.539
and the customers that you work with.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.810
Like I say, a bit of a disclaimer.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.609
I'm not a medical professional.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.197
I am colourblind.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.511
I am simply colourblind.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.199
This is my personal perspective.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.699
There are so many others,
and I really do encourage you

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.199
to talk to as many
people as possible.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.399
Have that open conversation.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.699
Create that open conversation
where it's not that judgment,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.639
it's about interest and intrigue,
and about innovation,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.849
and about really progressing
the conversation.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.976
If you've got any questions
after this session today,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.146
all my details are there.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.192
I'd love to talk more about it.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.420
On LinkedIn it's mattrobertsdesign,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.900
email mattroberts.me@gmail.com,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.419
website mattroberts.me,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:30.700
Instagram, again forward
slash, it's mattroberts.me.

00:33:31.258 --> 00:33:32.938
Thank you very much.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.129
<v Jessica> Well, Matt,
as your emcee, Jessica,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.289
I invite you to enable your camera

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.579
and let's talk about
the hop in chat and Q&amp;A.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.516
It has been lively in there for sure.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.068
I wanted to thank you
for that great presentation.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.389
We can go over some of the questions

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.939
that we've already
answered in writing.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.389
For instance, I captured
from Colton, he asked,

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.969
"What's it like interacting
with Google Maps?"

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.615
Maps can be difficult, you said.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.569
What helps is the flexibility
of knowing how the map is presented,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.919
and zooming allows the maps
to be more accessible for me.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.234
Do you have more to comment?

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.499
<v Matt> Yes, 100%.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.859
Yes, it's such a great question.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.979
Again, it's like an everyday
interaction, isn't it?

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.026
We're always trying to find
somewhere we need to go.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.969
That flexibility with Google Maps

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.669
and other maps out there,
having that option

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.764
to control
the environment a little bit.

00:34:35.995 --> 00:34:38.880
The satellite view,
and some of the other views,

00:34:38.881 --> 00:34:41.669
really can help just open up

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:46.459
that availability
and understanding things.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:52.620
Yes, once it's in a digital
environment, by and large,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.918
that really does help.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.019
<v Jessica> Let's move on.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.828
People are raring to know
about tools and things.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.079
I'm going to go
to the answered section.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.609
Jeff asks, "If you choose
to use the colour red

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.029
on your site, for example web links or buttons,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.299
and you provide enough contrast
beyond four and a half to one,

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.679
is it a concern for someone

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.409
who is colourblind
and has difficulty seeing red?

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.881
What's the best colour?"

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.589
<v Matt> It's definitely
unavoidable using red,

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.399
particularly if that's
your brand colour.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.189
You can't have that conversation

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.119
with the brand ambassadors
and the design team

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.179
to say we need to change red

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.679
because I saw a talk
at WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.469
What I would absolutely suggest,
as I mentioned in the presentation,

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.839
is just not relying
on that colour alone.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.019
Error messages are really renowned

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.700
for just highlighting the box

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.019
that's been used incorrectly,
just with a red outline.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.999
It's incredibly difficult to see.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.450
So, just adding some iconography
to that button would be great.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.839
Also, when you're referring
to something,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.149
say like the graphs and things like that,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.759
see colours in red where,
if you can't see that red,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.259
then there needs
to be other identifiers

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.989
there to really help be as accessible
and inclusive as possible.

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.499
<v Jessica> What about the brightness?

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.259
I have another question that says,

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.579
"Is identifying colours easier
in brighter light situations?"

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.649
<v Matt> I haven't noticed.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.079
[laughs] Maybe that's a good thing.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.329
I haven't noticed
whether it's a bright day

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:44.399
or a gloomier day,
or my phone screen is brighter

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.494
or darker that if
I can't see the colour,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.179
I generally can't see the colour.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.354
Yes, that's a great
question, by the way.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.160
No better or worse for me.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.259
<v Jessica> Then, our next
question from Ellen,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.590
we will answer this live.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.099
What tools do you use as a workaround

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.179
for sites that you
can't tell the colours?

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.849
She says, "Phones have
a colourblind mode,

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.329
and do you have that on a PC?"

00:37:15.514 --> 00:37:18.529
<v Matt> I don't use
any tools whatsoever.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.060
I experience the world as it is.

00:37:27.886 --> 00:37:28.859
Yes, I guess

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.658
then as being a designer,

00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:34.679
I then ensure that what
I'm designing, I can see,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.440
which means that hopefully
allow more and more people to see.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.509
If a website has been badly
designed and I can't see

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.059
the colours or the error messages
when I've been signing up

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.259
for things, I certainly distance
myself from that particular brand

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.779
or maybe report
it in a feedback thing.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.679
They might not be aware,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.939
and it's all about education
and advocacy, isn't it?

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.739
It's ensuring that there's a positive

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.529
at the end of that minor frustration

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.249
of not completing a registration
form or something like that.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.469
<v Jessica> So, really,
you just turn away and--

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.299
Okay. [laughs]

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.859
<v Matt> Turn away. [laughs]

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.219
Doesn't work for me.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.989
That's true of lots of experiences, right?

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.069
If it doesn't work for you,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.640
then you have a certain
threshold of patience.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.589
This isn't for me.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.879
I haven't been represented.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.659
I haven't been understood.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.319
There's a couple
of ways of going about it.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.719
If you can contribute
and have the energy

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.579
to contact them and be part
of their feedback system,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.079
maybe there's a insights community

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.109
or something like user
testing environment

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.869
that you can contribute
your perspective to

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.361
hopefully educate
and improve their services.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.270
<v Jessica> Thank you.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.599
I'm going to combine two questions.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.129
It says, "Does the contrast
versus the shade of the colours have

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.699
an effect on the outcome
of the colour for you?

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.609
For example, dark green
on light green."

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.480
The next question, similar,
that red and green,

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.259
is it harder for you
to differentiate? If they have red

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.499
and green with higher
contrast on the greyscale,

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.229
do you have a better chance
to distinguish them?

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.849
<v Matt> Yes, so there's definitely...

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.939
So, if you have to use
red and green,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.189
because Christmas is red
and green, right? Then yes,

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:31.169
absolutely, if the green is darker
and the red is brighter, for me

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:35.879
that definitely does help, because
if you think about that scenario

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.729
where if you were to view
that in greyscale,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:44.909
which is available,
you can see that there's a luminosity

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.019
to the brighter colour
compared to the darker colour.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.689
That's a fairly good indicator
as to how accessible

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.626
that is for someone who's colourblind.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.687
<v Jessica> I want
to segue over to tools.

00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:02.279
I remember reading in the chat
while the simulive was playing,

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.619
you had recommended
Sim Daltonism, correct?

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.499
<v Matt> Yes.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.439
<v Jessica> Can you go ahead
and talk to us about that?

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.419
It's not a WordPress tool per se.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.179
It's a standalone
that is on your computer.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.939
I've used it.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.819
Love it.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.779
Go ahead.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.177
<v Matt> Yes, it's a great tool.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.039
For those that don't know,
it's a little overlay

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.531
that you can put
on your screen at any point,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.539
and just as you're working,
you can just drag

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.269
this window over and select
the different types

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.589
of colour blindness
and experience in a certain way.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.684
It's really difficult
to really simulate

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.675
as accurately as possible
all the colourblind variations,

00:40:40.676 --> 00:40:41.909
same with any visual impairments.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.449
They are simulations,
they're pretty well educated,

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.369
but they will give you enough

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:52.080
of a steer to understand
whether what you're producing

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:58.170
might cause difficulty, really
in understanding that document,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.359
that presentation, that packaging,
whatever it may be.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:07.140
It's a really useful tool
that anybody can get access to.

00:41:07.789 --> 00:41:08.459
<v Jessica> Yes.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:14.549
Personally, I have installed
Chrome toolbar tools,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.789
for like colour picker
or colour simulators.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.862
That's like tied to your browser.

00:41:19.863 --> 00:41:21.539
Sim Daltonism is different

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.119
because you can drag
it over any application you're in.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.179
Like, say I'm in an Adobe product,

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.219
and I'm designing in Adobe,
I can, of course,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.187
always use their colour
vision deficiency simulator.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.339
If I don't have that available to me,
that built-in simulator,

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.339
then that's where a third-party tool
like that steps in, of course.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.859
<v Matt> [crosstalk] Yes.
It's really interesting for me

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.139
because then somebody... we'd have
conversations around tools like that

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.560
and others, saying, then showing me, so like,

00:41:49.561 --> 00:41:51.499
How do you...?

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.779
Does it work for you?

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.174
Because I'm looking
as a colourblind person

00:41:55.175 --> 00:41:57.019
through a colourblind
thing, so I don't--

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.339
It's almost like double layer.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.620
It's really difficult,
but having that conversation.

00:42:02.621 --> 00:42:05.609
If you start to see
colours slightly differently,

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.899
a little bit more set
back or saturated,

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.899
then that's a good thing
because it's starting

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.569
to educate you on different ways

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.775
that somebody could be viewing
your particular design.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.499
<v Jessica> I'm spelling
out the tool in the [chat].

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.449
<v Matt> Perfect. Thank you.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.729
<v Jessica> Let's go
ahead to try to wrap up.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.666
I have about five
more minutes of Q&amp;A.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.359
I will tell you James's question.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.299
Is this partially
why Europe uses neon

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.360
signs instead of red
for warning, et cetera?

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.527
Do you have experience in Europe?

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.519
<v Matt> I'm definitely in Europe,
but I don't know about this.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.082
I'm in the UK, so I don't know.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.019
I've never been asked that question,

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.369
and I've never investigated.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.840
It'd be unfair for me to answer,

00:42:51.841 --> 00:42:54.199
but that is certainly a place
that I can start having

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.670
a look at going forward.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.859
That's really interesting.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.419
<v Jessica> It might be
talking about the--

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.559
On the chat, we had a dialogue
about those traffic lights.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.250
In the US, we have
a standard of either

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.642
the red or the green
is always in position.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.529
When I found out in the chat
that there are some towns

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.559
that flip their traffic
lights horizontally

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.660
and that causes stress,
that was a new thing for me.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.819
Tell me about traffic lights.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.379
<v Matt> Yes.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.333
I guess it's that familiarity
with the system, isn't it?

00:43:30.334 --> 00:43:32.549
Just like you know that it's top,
middle, and bottom.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.829
Whether you look at the colour or not,
it's top, middle, and bottom.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.379
As soon as somebody
starts to play with that system

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.409
a little bit, you're then
having to check it twice.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:45.659
Yes, certainly if you are colourblind
in some sort of way,

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.449
you are trying
to learn it in a new way

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.790
and see whether you should be
stopping or carrying on driving.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.059
<v Jessica> Riley had a question.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.499
It looks like it has been answered,
but I'll give it a read.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:09.269
"I'm currently working on a project
where we are designing line charts

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.459
with up to 12 different values.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.979
I have noticed that the contrast

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.969
between the lines
is difficult to see.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.719
Most of them end up just
being colour-coded, and line styles

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.319
like the dash or the dotted
quickly become confusing.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.879
Have you run into
the challenge before,

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.779
and what are your suggestions?"

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.539
<v Matt> Yes, I've run into it a lot.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.433
[laughs] Graphs, yes, particularly,

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.139
like if there's one thing
to take away from here,

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:39.780
graphs and colour are a real pain
point for people who are colourblind.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:45.180
The suggestion that I'll make

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.569
is around the line
graph specifically.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.849
If you are in a position

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.369
to even make that line
a little bit thicker,

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.329
so there's a more visual
space taking up that colour,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.702
as well as the dotted
and dashes and all that,

00:44:59.703 --> 00:45:04.469
which is great to hear,
if you can make those lines thicker

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.669
or maybe split the graph
up over two slides,

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.639
if there's a way, or zooming
in or something like that,

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.779
which would really help more people,

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.100
I think that would be
a really strong starting point.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.969
<v Jessica> I've seen
those interactive graphs.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.729
Does that help you when you
can hover over the legend,

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.689
and then the part
in the graph moves--

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.672
<v Matt> Oh, yes, 100%.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:35.882
It's the same with, say,
writing documents and editing them.

00:45:35.883 --> 00:45:36.939
You see corrections in red.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.189
You see it all the time, don't you?

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.699
It's just inherently
what's wrong, but where now

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.419
a lot of the technologies
are annotated comments.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.949
You don't necessarily have to see

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:51.750
the red in the document,
but you can see a highlighted

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.999
comment section down
the right-hand side panel.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.090
That's incredibly useful,
and it's an absolute game-changer.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.100
<v Jessica> Thank you.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.619
My next question from Dina,

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.229
"I have a female college
friend who was fully colourblind

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.079
and has low vision,
and she thought her sweater

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.479
was entirely black until
I was testing gel lights

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.729
in a theatre lab,
and a fully red light

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.649
let her see the red
patterns on her sweater

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.889
for the first time,
and I'm guessing pure light

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.359
of particular colours might

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.454
be helpful for pushing
up the contrast."

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.339
<v Matt> That's incredible.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.205
[laughs]

00:46:28.206 --> 00:46:30.499
<v Jessica> I don't have
any comment on that one.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.859
<v Matt> No, I've definitely been
in those scenarios around fashion,

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.839
though, thinking that I love this
pair of brown trousers for years,

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.739
and somebody's saying,
"You realise those are green."

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.379
"Well, then I've got a favourite
pair of green trousers,

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.259
not brown trousers."

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.820
[laughs] It's sometimes
as daft and light-hearted as that.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:52.899
<v Jessica> I have another question.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.459
Do you want to give a shout-out

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.459
to any kind
of an accessibility plugin?

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.361
Do you have a favourite?

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.739
<v Matt> Apart from Sim
Daltonism, to be honest,

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.969
I don't use them,
so I wouldn't... [it would] be unfair of me

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.720
to comment any more than that.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.319
Yes, I'd just encourage you to have

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.719
a look in the design
tools that you use,

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.799
have a look at all
the tools and plugins

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.779
available for WordPress,
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.460
Just have a look.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.449
Also, as colour blindness is maybe
more common than you think,

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.389
you might actually know
someone who's colourblind,

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:39.259
so there's always
that real human check as well

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.559
on a particular document,

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.819
and also to perhaps credit
some of the tools that you are using,

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.199
because they might
be different to me,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.484
and they might use them
and advocate for those as well.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.569
<v Jessica> We started out
with the title of this talk

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.339
as Being a Colourblind Designer.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.410
As a designer, how do you
begin the colour palette

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:04.293
for an entire website
or digital product?

00:48:04.294 --> 00:48:08.790
Do you do your colour
contrast setup before you start?

00:48:09.552 --> 00:48:11.759
<v Matt> 100%.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.479
You're looking
at those palettes and having

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.299
that conversation with your client,

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.449
with your team as well, just
starting at that point

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:25.320
when you are in a position
to tweak colours,

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:31.200
and more often than not,
maybe your client may not notice,

00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:36.980
but what you do do is 1)
pass WCAG guidance more so,

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.220
but also you certainly help
more and more people

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.539
who are colourblind,

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.679
because you're doing those initial
checks right from the off.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.419
We've all been there.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.459
It's so difficult
to change it later on.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.860
[chuckles]

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.099
<v Jessica> It is.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.670
And we are at time.

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.919
I want to thank you
for your attention

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.647
with these questions and answers.

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.489
Audience, I thank you for attending
the session with Matt Roberts.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:07.169
You can continue the conversation
in the chat or on social media

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.420
using #WPA11YDay

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.580
and #WPAD2025.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.819
We also appreciate it if you go to

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:27.820
2025.accessibility.day/feedback

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.979
to provide anonymous feedback

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.899
