>> CHRIS HINES: Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:37.954
My name is Chris Hines,

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.271
and I'm the COO with Equalize
Digital.

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:42.841
Thank you for joining us
for Build for Everyone

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:46.610
or Build for No One with Elaine
Shannon and Kevin Andrews.

00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.680
Kevin is a certified web
accessibility specialist

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:53.120
who believes true accessibility
is about serving people,

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:55.619
not just meeting
compliance checkboxes.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.356
He brings this genuine
user-first mindset

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.225
to his work, training diverse teams,
leading audits,

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:04.528
and championing
a more inclusive web for everyone.

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.797
Elaine is a creator and developer

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:10.289
who's been working
with WordPress since 2007,

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:15.039
witnessing its evolution from simple
PHP to the modern block editor.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.175
She now brings that deep
experience to her role on the team,

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.177
maintaining and customizing hundreds

00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:22.646
of websites
for Georgetown University.

00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:24.346
Please feel free
to add your questions

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:25.916
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:27.785
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:30.788
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:31.889
>> KEVIN ANDREWS: Welcome, everyone.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.624
My name is Kevin Andrews.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:38.229
I'm an IAAP-certified
web accessibility specialist.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.933
That's International Association
of Accessibility Professionals.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.036
I have been working
as a web accessibility

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.682
professional for about a decade.

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.275
I've also been navigating
the web with a screen reader

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:54.979
for more than 20 years,
which means I know what it feels

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.481
like to be completely
ignored by websites

00:02:57.482 --> 00:03:00.418
that consider accessibility optional.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.987
I'm also neurodivergent,
which means I process

00:03:02.988 --> 00:03:07.352
information differently
from what society deems typical.

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:10.428
In practical terms,
that basically means I notice

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:12.196
when websites are confusing,

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:14.999
inconsistent,
or illogical in ways that many users

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.368
might not even consciously register.

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.268
But it can make life
really frustrating

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.572
or impossible for some of us.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.375
Beyond my personal experience,
I'm also in charge

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:29.295
of Georgetown University's electronic
IT accessibility program.

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:32.483
So that's not just about
checking boxes or compliance,

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:35.119
although there is
some compliance stuff.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.055
It's also about making sure
every piece of digital content,

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:40.185
application, every workflow,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.201
all the digital stuff,
are truly usable

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.097
by the people it's meant to serve.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.177
Today, we're going to show you

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:51.902
the practical steps
to improve accessibility

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:55.870
across the board with no excuses,
no perfectionism.

00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:59.376
Elaine will demonstrate
developer-focused solutions,

00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:02.913
but my goal is really to show
you why these changes matter

00:04:02.914 --> 00:04:05.559
from a user's lived perspective.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.520
>> ELAINE SHANNON: Hi, everyone,
I'm Elaine Shannon.

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.923
I work with Kevin on the web
services team at Georgetown.

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:17.929
I have an invisible disability
and some neurodivergence, too.

00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:21.165
I've been building
websites for almost 30 years,

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:25.035
and I've been using WordPress
for about 15 of those years.

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:27.035
This is the only team I've worked on

00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:30.441
that has had a dedicated
accessibility expert.

00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:33.011
As you can imagine,
it's very different to have

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:35.880
a full-time screen
reader user on your team.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.948
If you're ever in a position
to influence

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.951
this on your own team,
it's invaluable.

00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:42.553
If not, don't give up.

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:44.221
We're here to help
you learn a few ways

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:46.023
to improve the websites you build

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:49.356
without having to hire
another team member.

00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.062
Moving on to our first slide
of content,

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:54.465
we have the heading
"Why This Matters"

00:04:54.466 --> 00:05:00.137
and a startling statistic that 97%
of the top 1 million homepages

00:05:00.138 --> 00:05:02.106
have accessibility errors,

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:06.044
according to the WebAIM
Million 2025 survey.

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:13.794
>> KEVIN: Accessibility
is not a niche concern.

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:15.754
One in four adults

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:19.456
in the United States lives
with some form of disability,

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:24.162
and many more face situational
or temporary limitations.

00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:27.231
That's anything from bright sunlight

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:28.532
washing out your phone screen

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:32.836
to a sprained wrist that might
prevent the use of a mouse.

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:34.705
Websites that ignore these realities

00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:38.376
are actively frustrating
or excluding users.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.744
As someone
who is multiplied disabled,

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:44.582
I encounter inaccessible websites
pretty much every single day.

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:45.683
It's not just inconvenient.

00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:48.786
It's exclusionary
and just really annoying.

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:51.555
A missing label
or a confusing page structure

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:55.285
can make an entire website
pretty much unusable.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.630
Accessibility improvements
don't just help those people;

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.298
they make life easier for everyone.

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:03.667
It's also about dignity
and independence, and yes,

00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:06.561
it's about doing your job properly.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.408
>> ELAINE: As a developer,
when you think about accessibility,

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.944
it's tempting to just picture
a small group of users

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:17.147
with very specific needs,
like blind people.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:20.784
But the truth is,
accessibility benefits everybody.

00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:22.820
When we make buttons
bigger to help users

00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.689
with limited dexterity,
we're also making it easier

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.993
for mobile users to hit
the right thing with their thumb.

00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:31.161
When we design high contrast text,

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:34.632
we might be thinking specifically
of users with low vision,

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:36.634
but that contrast
is going to help anyone

00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:39.269
who's outside on a dim
screen in bright sunlight,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.407
anyone with failing vision,
all sorts of different situations.

00:06:43.408 --> 00:06:45.442
You might think
captions or transcripts

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:47.978
are only going to be seen
by deaf people,

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.682
but they also really help people
like me who don't process audio

00:06:51.683 --> 00:06:53.817
as quickly as visual input.

00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:55.919
And they can be very useful in noisy

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.788
environments like a coffee shop,

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.692
even for users who don't have
any physical hearing problems.

00:07:01.693 --> 00:07:05.062
Accessibility is really about
universal design,

00:07:05.063 --> 00:07:08.465
making things work
for the widest possible audience.

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:10.000
The more accessibility we build

00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:14.920
in for some users, the more usability
we build in for everyone.

00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:17.808
Moving on in our slides,

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:20.644
we have the heading
example one skip link,

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:23.013
and the text css-tricks.com.

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:25.283
Skip link is invisible.

00:07:25.984 --> 00:07:26.833
>> KEVIN: All right.

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:29.787
I want to show you a website,
which Elaine just read off,

00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:32.056
where the skip link exists,

00:07:32.057 --> 00:07:35.626
but the fun thing
about that is it's invisible

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:38.563
unless you are using a screen reader,

00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:41.498
which is something
you might not expect.

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:45.335
The site is technically accessible
to one tiny subset of users

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:47.815
in this case, in this example,

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.075
and it's completely
useless to everyone else.

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:53.310
This is a perfect example
of why accessible

00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:56.204
only for some is not accessibility;

00:07:56.214 --> 00:08:00.417
it's tokenism if we think about it,
and just call it what it is.

00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:02.920
When I navigate this page,
ironically, the skip link

00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:05.389
is visible to me, but only to me.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.524
It's a perfect example
of how treating access

00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:11.495
as a priority for some users
can actually exclude others.

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:13.997
Think about
the keyboard-only sighted user,

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:16.934
we talked about that sprained
wrist earlier, for example.

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:19.636
Wastes time, it adds frustration,
and tells people

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:24.308
that the site wasn't really designed
for their experience at all.

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:28.846
Accessibility is not just
a side project or a checkbox;

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:30.848
it needs to benefit everyone.

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:33.411
Elaine will now play the video.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.760
I'm on the CSS Tricks home page.

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:47.098
That's css-tricks.com.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.188
If I press tab-

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:51.935
>> SCREEN READER: CSS Tricks,
a website about making websites,

00:08:51.936 --> 00:08:54.404
same-page link,
skip the main content.

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:57.574
>> KEVIN: -you'll see that there's
a skip to main content link,

00:08:57.575 --> 00:09:01.713
but it is only accessible
to screen reader users.

00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:05.146
However, it is the first element

00:09:07.062 --> 00:09:11.988
to which you tab on the page.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.949
The next one-

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.419
>> SCREEN READER: CSS Tricks link.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.849
>> KEVIN: -is the logo, which you
actually see visually, but here-

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.329
>> SCREEN READER: Skip the main content,
same-page link.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.566
>> KEVIN: -is the skip to main,
which is beneficial for everyone,

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:24.268
not just screen reader users.

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:27.443
To show how this works,
if I press enter-

00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:29.521
>> SCREEN READER: 8 regions
to direct, article.

00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:31.511
Main region, article,
link direct, link to the--

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.211
>> KEVIN: -so it moves
you to the beginning

00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:35.847
of the main content as implied.

00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:38.450
>> SCREEN READER: More button.

00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:40.190
Pause recording.

00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:41.068
Stop recording.

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:42.287
Yes.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.791
>> ELAINE: If you've done
any front-end development,

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:50.494
the odds are that you've
probably seen this site.

00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:52.930
It's a really good resource,
so it surprised me

00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:55.032
that this is how they set it up.

00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:58.035
This is a great example
of assuming which type

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:00.003
of users need a certain feature

00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:02.673
and trying to only
make that feature available

00:10:02.674 --> 00:10:05.343
to those users and nobody else.

00:10:05.677 --> 00:10:08.612
If you assume that only
people with screen readers

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:10.180
are going to use a skip link,

00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:13.831
then making it invisible
is basically harmless.

00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:16.481
Now, along comes
someone with 20-20 vision

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.322
who uses keyboard navigation,

00:10:18.323 --> 00:10:21.525
maybe that sprained wrist
user we were talking about.

00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:23.393
They tab onto the page,

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:25.696
and there's no visual
indicator to tell them

00:10:25.697 --> 00:10:27.698
that there's a skip link here,

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:30.509
unless you count the very tiny URL

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:35.205
that shows up in some browsers'
bottom left corners of the screen.

00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:38.175
But really, there should be
a reasonably sized button

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.244
so it's clear that if you hit enter,

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:43.181
you'll be able to skip
to the content.

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:46.650
Adding or fixing a skip link
is usually one of the easier things

00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:48.585
you can do to improve a website,

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:50.687
but it makes a big impact.

00:10:50.688 --> 00:10:53.991
Imagine having to tab all the way
through a large navigation

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:57.461
menu before you can get
down to the content of a page.

00:10:57.462 --> 00:10:59.297
It's a big time suck.

00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.400
As a developer, one other thing
you can do is test out websites

00:11:03.401 --> 00:11:05.168
with only your keyboard.

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:07.038
No mouse, no trackpad.

00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:10.641
If you get frustrated
having to tab endlessly,

00:11:10.642 --> 00:11:13.401
imagine how a user
who can't use a mouse

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:16.280
or trackpad to bypass content feels.

00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:19.140
Experiencing frustration
yourself is a great way

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.418
to build empathy for users and ensure

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:24.593
that you make things
better for everyone.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.219
On our next slide,
we have the heading

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.517
"Example 2: contrast,"
and the text "MrFancyPants.com"

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:35.365
lacks accessible contrast,

00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:38.857
even though ironically
it's full of contrast.

00:11:39.737 --> 00:11:42.272
It might surprise
those of you who can see

00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:45.142
this website to learn
that it actually does

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:47.711
not have accessible color contrast.

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:50.380
There are some areas
here that are great.

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:53.517
In the top navigation,
white text on a black background

00:11:53.518 --> 00:11:55.987
is as good as you can get.

00:11:56.688 --> 00:11:58.922
Further down the page, the quick menu

00:11:58.923 --> 00:12:02.025
section is where we start
to get into trouble.

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.494
Look at the white
text that says pigments

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:06.731
on a light cyan button.

00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:10.067
It's obviously a big challenge
to come up with a large palette

00:12:10.068 --> 00:12:11.868
of button colors where either

00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:14.004
black or white text
will contrast enough

00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:16.006
to make every button readable,

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:18.175
and it seems
like they're trying here.

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:20.510
But you don't just
have to try and guess

00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:22.846
whether your combinations
are accessible.

00:12:22.847 --> 00:12:25.315
You can paste your colors
into WebAIM's color

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:28.216
contrast checking tool and find out.

00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:35.193
As an example, I'm going to check
the pigments button

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:38.419
in WebAIM's color contrast checker.

00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:41.898
If you just search for WebAIM
color contrast checker,

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:44.735
it will come up with a couple
of different options.

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:48.306
I'm using just
the plain contrast checker here

00:12:48.373 --> 00:12:51.108
because we have a little
bit of a complex setup

00:12:51.109 --> 00:12:54.745
with background colors
as well as buttons and links.

00:12:54.746 --> 00:12:58.382
This is more complicated
than just a white background

00:12:58.383 --> 00:13:01.685
with one color of text
and a different color of links.

00:13:01.686 --> 00:13:03.620
If you have that simpler scenario,

00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:07.225
their link contrast
checker can also check

00:13:07.558 --> 00:13:10.120
the links versus the body text.

00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:11.495
Again, in this case,

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:14.164
with the complicated
backgrounds and things,

00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:17.418
just going with the contrast
checker tool.

00:13:17.702 --> 00:13:22.066
I am going to inspect
the pigments button in my browser.

00:13:23.808 --> 00:13:27.678
Find its colors.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.915
There's the cyan background color.

00:13:31.616 --> 00:13:34.195
They do have inputs
on the contrast checker

00:13:34.196 --> 00:13:36.854
for background and foreground.

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.525
Then, I expect this is
probably pure white,

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:43.326
but I'm just double-checking.

00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:44.762
Yes, it is.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.330
Put in that as the foreground value.

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.596
As you can see here,

00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:54.237
as you scroll down the page
past where you input

00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:56.406
the foreground and background color,

00:13:56.407 --> 00:14:02.346
normal-size text fails
both AA and AAA standard.

00:14:02.847 --> 00:14:06.250
Large text and graphical
objects also fail.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.318
There just isn't enough contrast

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:12.457
between the white and the cyan color.

00:14:12.757 --> 00:14:16.326
Now, it does have little sliders
underneath each of these,

00:14:16.327 --> 00:14:20.730
so I can darken
and it will continue to update

00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:24.001
the contrast ratio until we see

00:14:24.335 --> 00:14:29.507
here large text is now passing,
even though normal text is not.

00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:32.175
Let's double-check our font
size here.

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.178
We're at 16 pixels,

00:14:34.512 --> 00:14:37.882
which is not going
to be large enough.

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.818
I would want to go
even a little darker cyan

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:45.422
until normal text goes
into the passing range.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:51.028
This much darker cyan provides
accessible contrast against white.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.799
Of course, the other thing
that you can do is, say,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.035
change the text color.

00:14:58.669 --> 00:15:05.443
If I go back and paste
that same color,

00:15:08.012 --> 00:15:11.616
here's the hex code
for the original cyan.

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:16.254
What if I just used
black text on that?

00:15:16.587 --> 00:15:18.174
That also works.

00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:23.160
If Mr. Fancy Pants wanted
to keep that same exact cyan color,

00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:26.730
all they need to do is change
the text black, as they have done

00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:29.366
on a few of the other
light colored buttons,

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:32.303
and that is accessible contrast.

00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:35.472
Another quick and dirty way

00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:37.774
to test your color
contrast is to print out

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.676
your site in grayscale.

00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:43.146
You don't necessarily have to fully
print a physical page.

00:15:43.147 --> 00:15:46.083
Just printing
a grayscale PDF is fine.

00:15:46.484 --> 00:15:49.853
When you do this,
it really will show you how colors

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:52.473
like red and green
don't have enough contrast

00:15:52.474 --> 00:15:55.091
for anyone with color blindness.

00:15:55.092 --> 00:15:56.927
Kevin, I think you had
some more insight

00:15:56.928 --> 00:15:59.363
on why contrast is important.

00:15:59.897 --> 00:16:00.597
>> KEVIN: Of course.

00:16:00.598 --> 00:16:03.600
Let's talk about color
contrast some more.

00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:08.138
Low contrast it's not just a problem
for visually impaired or low vision

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:11.313
or whatever you want
to call them, users.

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:14.578
It makes content
almost impossible to read

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:16.846
in daylight, on older screens,

00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:21.351
or for anyone whose eyes
aren't at peak performance, guilty.

00:16:21.352 --> 00:16:25.188
Think about small text
while standing on a crowded train

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:27.390
or trying to fill out
a form at a doctor's office

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:31.127
with harsh lighting,
like every doctor's office ever.

00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:36.047
Poor contrast slows everyone down,
not just the targeted users.

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:39.269
Strong contrast ensures
readability for everyone,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.915
and it doesn't take much effort.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.408
Choosing the right text
and background colors is a simple,

00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:47.877
practical step
that really can prevent

00:16:47.878 --> 00:16:49.913
exclusion before it even happens.

00:16:49.914 --> 00:16:53.960
If your site forces me,
the ambiguous me, to squint,

00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:56.353
it's effectively telling
me I'm not welcome,

00:16:56.354 --> 00:17:00.162
even if I'm the only
one wearing reading glasses.

00:17:05.563 --> 00:17:06.652
>> ELAINE: On our next slide,

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:09.733
we have the heading
"Example 3: Landmarks,"

00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:12.069
with the text "harvard.edu,"

00:17:12.403 --> 00:17:15.656
includes the word
navigation in landmarks.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.075
>> KEVIN: Some websites love
to overlabel these landmarks,

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:22.345
and it's just another way
to make navigation a headache.

00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:26.417
In a second,
we'll play a recording of a page

00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:31.554
where the screen announces
navigation, navigation.

00:17:31.555 --> 00:17:32.789
It's multiple times in a row,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.725
and every time you kind of go
through the page,

00:17:35.726 --> 00:17:37.794
drill down through landmarks,

00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:42.232
you'll hear the same meaningless
label repeated endlessly.

00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:44.367
A little bit of an exaggeration,
but you'll get the point.

00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:46.636
It adds cognitive load,
and it slows me down.

00:17:46.637 --> 00:17:49.706
It turns a simple task
like finding the main content

00:17:49.707 --> 00:17:51.508
into this endurance exercise.

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:53.143
It's why accessibility,

00:17:53.144 --> 00:17:56.713
it's not these arbitrary rules,
it's real-world usability.

00:17:56.714 --> 00:18:00.250
Landmarks guide,
they should not really confuse,

00:18:00.251 --> 00:18:02.619
and they should be clearly labeled.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.487
That benefits everyone,
not just folks

00:18:04.488 --> 00:18:05.922
with assistive technology.

00:18:05.923 --> 00:18:07.659
We'll play the video.

00:18:11.103 --> 00:18:14.753
I'll go to the Harvard
University homepage now.

>> KEVIN: As you can hear,
it's saying navigation twice.

00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:32.115
I'll do that one more time.

00:18:32.116 --> 00:18:33.616

00:18:33.617 --> 00:18:35.752
>> KEVIN: Search and navigation,

00:18:35.753 --> 00:18:37.489
I'll do it once more.

Website Navigation Navigation Region.

00:18:42.526 --> 00:18:43.093
>> KEVIN: As you can see,

00:18:43.094 --> 00:18:47.565
all of these sort
of navigation-related landmarks

00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:53.104
have navigation in the title,
and it's just redundant.

00:18:53.437 --> 00:18:54.738
It's more annoying than anything.

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:58.241
It's certainly better than nothing,
but it's just unnecessary.

00:18:58.242 --> 00:19:01.241
There's no reason
to have navigation appended

00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:04.382
to the name of a navigation landmark.

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:09.218
It will tell a screen
reader user if it is

00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:13.990
marked up correctly
as a navigation-related landmark,

00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:18.355
so there's just no need
to have navigation in the label.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:19.897

>> ELAINE: If you're a sighted
user like me,

00:19:27.738 --> 00:19:30.607
there are some little
accessibility bookmarklets

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:34.575
that can help you see
the landmarks on any website.

00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:38.148
I just searched
for accessibility bookmarklets.

00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:40.683
In the search results,
there are several options.

00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:42.252
The ones that I like to use

00:19:42.253 --> 00:19:47.187
are from
accessibility-bookmarklets.org.

00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:49.659
They give you a little overview

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.164
of how they will look
once you're using them,

00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:56.666
and some installation
instructions, but really,

00:19:56.667 --> 00:19:57.600
it's pretty easy.

00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:59.836
You just grab the one that you want,

00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:02.372
hover over it with the mouse,
and click,

00:20:02.373 --> 00:20:07.678
and I am dragging this up
onto my favorites bar in my browser.

00:20:07.978 --> 00:20:10.738
I have landmarks, now headings,

00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:16.921
lists, images, and forms.

00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:19.589
Now, these bookmarklets
are just some JavaScript

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.958
that runs when you click on them.

00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:24.360
If I go back to Harvard's homepage

00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:27.331
and hit my new landmarks bookmarklet,

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:32.269
there's little boxes and labels
for each of the landmarks.

00:20:32.703 --> 00:20:35.962
Theirs is not quite
as straightforward as some,

00:20:35.963 --> 00:20:38.541
just because they have
this pretty transparent

00:20:38.542 --> 00:20:41.352
header on top of their hero image.

00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:44.441
A lot of websites
like Mr. Fancy Pants

00:20:44.442 --> 00:20:46.673
would have their navigation

00:20:46.917 --> 00:20:51.482
above the main instead
of overlaid on top,

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.623
almost like a transparency,

00:20:53.624 --> 00:20:56.560
but that looks
like it should be fine.

00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:00.763
Scrolling down the page, everything
that you would expect to see

00:21:00.764 --> 00:21:03.491
in the main landmark is included,

00:21:04.535 --> 00:21:07.103
and then as we reach
the bottom of the page,

00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:09.272
there's this content info landmark

00:21:09.273 --> 00:21:12.764
for the footer
with a few bits of navigation.

00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:16.978
Little bit of funky CSS
around the navigation,

00:21:16.979 --> 00:21:19.183
but that shouldn't prevent

00:21:19.517 --> 00:21:22.318
a screen reader user
from being able to tell,

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:24.120
hey, these are navigation,

00:21:24.121 --> 00:21:26.823
this is the main tag,
all those sorts of things

00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:28.807
that's helpful for them.

00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:32.829
That's one easy way to inspect
either your own website

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.510
or someone else's,

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:37.367
and then past the landmarks,
of course,

00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:39.602
you can check easily and see, okay,

00:21:39.603 --> 00:21:42.038
the H1 is the first tag on the page,

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:45.308
got some H2s further on, so it looks

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:49.117
like they are using
their heading tags correctly.

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:53.082
It can also show any lists
that may be on the page,

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:56.986
it can highlight images,
but not background images,

00:21:56.987 --> 00:22:00.924
just image tags and forms,
which it doesn't look

00:22:00.925 --> 00:22:03.726
like we have on this particular page,

00:22:03.727 --> 00:22:05.194
but it's just a nice,

00:22:05.195 --> 00:22:09.599
easy visual way to check
on things and make sure

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.774
they are how you would expect
them to be.

00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:16.606
The way to fix this problem depends

00:22:16.607 --> 00:22:19.275
on how your theme
and plugins are built.

00:22:19.276 --> 00:22:22.211
It's really easy if you're using
a full-site editing theme

00:22:22.212 --> 00:22:23.846
with a navigation block.

00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:26.486
You can literally
just go into the editor

00:22:26.487 --> 00:22:28.184
and make sure you do not enter

00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:30.887
the word navigation in the label.

00:22:30.888 --> 00:22:33.856
If you have an older theme,
you may find you need to add

00:22:33.857 --> 00:22:35.892
an aria-label in your codebase,

00:22:35.893 --> 00:22:38.828
and just make sure to leave
off that word navigation,

00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:41.729
so only the automatic one gets read.

00:22:44.034 --> 00:22:46.903
On our next slide,
our heading is example four,

00:22:46.904 --> 00:22:48.538
semantic structure,

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:54.111
with the text techcrunch.com
uses non-semantic HTML.

00:22:54.678 --> 00:22:57.680
For this one,
the image is what's important.

00:22:57.681 --> 00:23:01.551
I have a screenshot
of the website up in a web browser.

00:23:01.552 --> 00:23:04.053
The left, approximately
half to two-thirds,

00:23:04.054 --> 00:23:05.955
is showing what's visually seen

00:23:05.956 --> 00:23:09.325
on the page, the regular front
end that any visitor would see,

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:15.032
and the right half to a third
is the code inspector view.

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:20.236
TechCrunch is a big website
that presents a lot of information.

00:23:20.237 --> 00:23:24.707
Whether you're blind or sighted,
it's just a lot to take in.

00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:27.844
What makes it harder
for both people in search engines

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:32.843
to parse is it doesn't always use
the proper semantic structure.

00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:36.252
What I mean is I can look
at the website with my eyes,

00:23:36.253 --> 00:23:40.456
and my eyes tell me that the words
top headlines is a heading,

00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:44.827
and underneath it, there's a list
of bulleted items underneath.

00:23:44.828 --> 00:23:48.636
Unfortunately,
if you look on the code view side,

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:52.902
what you'll see is top
headlines isn't a heading at all.

00:23:52.903 --> 00:23:57.584
It's actually a strong tag
inside a paragraph, inside a div,

00:23:58.509 --> 00:24:02.317
and the list, unfortunately,
isn't a list either.

00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:07.785
We've got divitis here
with an H3 heading tag.

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:12.622
This website is missing out
on a lot of built-in functionality.

00:24:12.623 --> 00:24:14.090
A screen reader can't tell

00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:16.826
a user they're looking
at a list of five items

00:24:16.827 --> 00:24:20.130
if it's not an HTML
list of five items.

00:24:20.464 --> 00:24:22.144
They're just divs.

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:27.304
Now, interestingly, the headlines
inside of them are headings,

00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:31.207
so they make it into the outline
of the document.

00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.777
Since they're H3s
that aren't actually

00:24:33.778 --> 00:24:36.212
after any other headings on the page,

00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:39.115
they just get stuck up
at the top level of the outline,

00:24:39.116 --> 00:24:42.218
which I don't think
is what they intended.

00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:44.987
There's also an untitled body,
untitled NAV,

00:24:44.988 --> 00:24:48.003
if you're looking
at the HTML5 outline,

00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:52.428
because there's no heading element
directly under the body or the NAV.

00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:53.329
The browser doesn't know

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.662
what they were trying
to call those things.

00:24:58.302 --> 00:25:03.062
Now, the last thing I want
to show you today is one more tool

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.872
that's an easy add-on
to most web browsers.

00:25:07.111 --> 00:25:08.377
I'm using Chrome here.

00:25:08.378 --> 00:25:11.749
I searched for HTML5 outliner.

00:25:12.816 --> 00:25:15.184
You can see it appears
in the Chrome Store.

00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:18.287
Since I already
have this Chrome extension,

00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:20.056
it shows me a remove button.

00:25:20.057 --> 00:25:21.624
If you don't have it yet,

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:24.640
there will be an install
or add button.

00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:28.699
What this does
is it adds a little icon

00:25:29.032 --> 00:25:31.835
next to your address bar.

00:25:32.369 --> 00:25:34.637
When you click on that icon,

00:25:34.638 --> 00:25:39.977
it lists out the HTML5
outline of that page.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.079
Now, again,
TechCrunch is a huge website

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.647
with a lot of information.

00:25:44.648 --> 00:25:46.879
We have a lot of data here.

00:25:47.017 --> 00:25:49.719
As I was mentioning,
the untitled body,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.055
untitled NAV
is because there's nothing up

00:25:53.056 --> 00:25:56.526
toward the top of the page
that's actually an H1.

00:25:56.527 --> 00:25:59.606
The first headings are these H3s

00:25:59.607 --> 00:26:02.498
that appear to be a list
but really aren't.

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:06.169
So it really crunches
things up in a different order

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.905
than they probably want to reflect

00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:10.573
for anyone using this outline,

00:26:10.574 --> 00:26:12.642
which could be a screen reader user.

00:26:12.643 --> 00:26:15.378
It could be somebody
who tabs through headings.

00:26:15.379 --> 00:26:17.180
It could also be a search engine

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:19.482
that you want to index your content.

00:26:19.483 --> 00:26:22.552
Those tags are not quite as magical

00:26:22.553 --> 00:26:25.154
as they used to be in years past.

00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:27.717
But they still have some impact

00:26:27.858 --> 00:26:31.861
on what you're saying
is most important and less important,

00:26:31.862 --> 00:26:34.932
and kind of sub-items
in your outline.

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:37.496
If you keep an eye on this,

00:26:38.068 --> 00:26:40.536
you can look up
and see basically anytime

00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:42.371
you have a semantic
sectioning element,

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:45.017
it needs a heading of some kind,

00:26:45.108 --> 00:26:48.144
even if it's not visible
to sighted users.

00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:52.215
Of course, it's not a great practice
to just throw

00:26:52.216 --> 00:26:54.045
in a bunch of invisible headings

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:56.485
just to make this outline
look better.

00:26:56.486 --> 00:26:59.522
It's one of those situations
where you really need to start

00:26:59.523 --> 00:27:02.158
from the beginning
of the design process,

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:05.628
incorporating the right
headings into the layout.

00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:10.167
That will help you to achieve
a cleaner HTML5 outline.

00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:12.735
This can also be a very handy way.

00:27:12.736 --> 00:27:14.604
It'll work on any website.

00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:15.838
Just pull it up.

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:19.965
You can see what headings
other structures are using.

00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:24.280
What do you have to say
about all this, Kevin?

00:27:24.281 --> 00:27:26.678
>> KEVIN: Well, that sounds fun.

00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:32.862
Broken semantic structure,
as you can imagine,

00:27:32.863 --> 00:27:35.958
it can really make websites
feel like mazes.

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:39.496
For example,
a logo text that reads logo

00:27:40.264 --> 00:27:42.909
likely is invisible information.

00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:45.968
When a heading
is missing or it's just big,

00:27:45.969 --> 00:27:49.381
bold, fancy font,
that's not a real heading.

00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:54.811
I can't just skim a page,
like the way sighted users can.

00:27:55.479 --> 00:27:59.682
Being able to go by heading,
heading, heading is super helpful.

00:27:59.683 --> 00:28:01.363
Use real headings.

00:28:01.685 --> 00:28:04.621
When lists aren't marked up properly,

00:28:04.955 --> 00:28:07.690
the content is meaningless
to screen reader users.

00:28:07.691 --> 00:28:11.027
You just hear things vertically,
but you don't know

00:28:11.028 --> 00:28:13.796
that it's a list
of things necessarily.

00:28:13.797 --> 00:28:15.731
These aren't minor issues.

00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:18.834
They can really prevent the user,
not just myself,

00:28:18.835 --> 00:28:22.071
from understanding or interacting
with content independently.

00:28:22.072 --> 00:28:23.973
It's a small effort to fix headings,

00:28:23.974 --> 00:28:26.453
alt text, and list structures.

00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:29.445
It can really drastically
improve usability.

00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:31.615
If you ignore semantics,

00:28:31.949 --> 00:28:34.817
it's like handing someone
a map with half the roads erased.

00:28:34.818 --> 00:28:37.049
Good luck finding your way.

00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:42.992
>> ELAINE: Moving on to our next slide,

00:28:42.993 --> 00:28:45.929
we have the heading "Our Experience."

00:28:45.996 --> 00:28:47.964
We summed this up with the text.

00:28:47.965 --> 00:28:51.233
There is no one,
quote-unquote, "typical user."

00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:55.201
So there's no photo
that encapsulates that concept.

00:28:55.305 --> 00:28:56.954
>> KEVIN: All right.

00:28:56.955 --> 00:28:58.774
Every single day,
I encounter websites

00:28:58.775 --> 00:29:01.711
that are a masterclass
in frustration.

00:29:01.878 --> 00:29:04.914
You want to check
the score of a sports game?

00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:05.915
Good luck.

00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:08.050
You want to try
to figure out COVID statistics

00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:10.386
if they're even still around
and haven't been erased?

00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:13.223
Sure, if you enjoy guessing.

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:15.491
Filling out medical
paperwork online can feel

00:29:15.492 --> 00:29:17.927
like a puzzle designed
to make me fail or,

00:29:17.928 --> 00:29:19.829
worse, rip my hair out.

00:29:20.797 --> 00:29:22.946
Booking a flight or hotel?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.535
Sometimes you think
I was trying to launch a rocket.

00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:28.337
Doing anything that requires school

00:29:28.338 --> 00:29:30.539
registration or even basic
independence

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.141
for a lot of people can become

00:29:32.142 --> 00:29:36.713
a chore with the incorrect
or missing markup.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:41.617
We were talking about headings
and landmarks, and that's markup.

00:29:41.618 --> 00:29:43.953
These barriers
are not just theoretical.

00:29:43.954 --> 00:29:47.356
They directly affect
the dignity and independence

00:29:47.357 --> 00:29:48.491
for millions of people.

00:29:48.492 --> 00:29:50.393
Again, not just myself.

00:29:50.794 --> 00:29:51.761
Here's the kicker.

00:29:51.762 --> 00:29:54.076
None of this is hard to fix.

00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:55.698
Buttons need labels.

00:29:55.699 --> 00:29:57.682
Headings need hierarchy.

00:29:57.768 --> 00:30:00.704
Don't just jump
straight to heading 3.

00:30:01.304 --> 00:30:03.005
Lists need semantic markup.

00:30:03.006 --> 00:30:04.573
Navigation needs structure.

00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:06.108
Yet somehow, the simplest things

00:30:06.109 --> 00:30:08.377
are overlooked
while stakeholders focus

00:30:08.378 --> 00:30:11.271
on shiny features no one asked for.

00:30:11.281 --> 00:30:12.615
I don't need perfect.

00:30:12.616 --> 00:30:13.716
I need usable.

00:30:13.717 --> 00:30:15.397
And yes, narcoside.

00:30:15.452 --> 00:30:18.522
Every decision a stakeholder makes

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:22.224
can either empower or frustrate
the crap out of users like me.

00:30:22.225 --> 00:30:23.905
It's that simple.

00:30:26.196 --> 00:30:28.431
>> ELAINE: I think,
as developers, first,

00:30:28.432 --> 00:30:30.766
it's our responsibility to be aware

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:32.668
that most people will need some sort

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:36.505
of accessibility feature
at some point in their lives.

00:30:36.506 --> 00:30:38.507
Then there are some people
like Kevin, of course,

00:30:38.508 --> 00:30:41.277
who need those features
every day just to be able to go

00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:43.979
through the basics of daily living.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.149
I'm not saying
that you could have prevented

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.350
any of the mistakes you made

00:30:48.351 --> 00:30:51.754
in the past that made
your website hard for people to use.

00:30:51.755 --> 00:30:53.689
I've done some bad stuff, too.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.926
But I am saying
that now that you know a little more,

00:30:56.927 --> 00:30:58.627
it's your responsibility to keep

00:30:58.628 --> 00:31:01.643
learning more and making
things better.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.169
On our next slide, we have
the heading "No perfectionism"

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.851
and the simple text, "It doesn't
have to be all or nothing."

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:15.244
>> KEVIN: Accessibility
is not a perfect science.

00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:17.246
I think we can all agree on that.

00:31:17.247 --> 00:31:21.690
It's really an iterative process
where small improvements

00:31:21.885 --> 00:31:23.252
they really compound and they add up

00:31:23.253 --> 00:31:25.588
into a better experience
for everyone.

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:26.989
You don't have to wait
for every detail

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.258
to be perfected before acting.

00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:32.671
Every fix you make today
can remove barriers

00:31:32.963 --> 00:31:36.465
that will prevent someone
from using your site effectively.

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:39.235
So done is better than perfect,

00:31:39.236 --> 00:31:43.940
because perfect is often
just code for never starting.

00:31:44.508 --> 00:31:46.509
Accessibility doesn't need
to be glamorous,

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.113
but it does need to be effective.

00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:53.333
Think of it as triage.

00:31:54.017 --> 00:31:56.852
You fix the biggest
pain points first,

00:31:56.853 --> 00:31:58.821
and the rest will fall into place,

00:31:58.822 --> 00:32:01.715
of course, with the right supports.

00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:07.096
>> ELAINE: I think one reason teams
hesitate to tackle accessibility

00:32:07.097 --> 00:32:09.231
is because it feels overwhelming.

00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:12.601
We have standards like WCAG,
but they're so technical,

00:32:12.602 --> 00:32:15.738
it feels hard to fully
understand what they mean

00:32:15.739 --> 00:32:18.874
and what to actually
do to implement them.

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:22.207
But anything you improve
is an improvement.

00:32:22.212 --> 00:32:24.713
You don't need to overhaul
your site tomorrow,

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:27.116
but think about
what one or two things

00:32:27.117 --> 00:32:29.385
you could tackle this month.

00:32:29.386 --> 00:32:31.754
If you start with high-impact areas,

00:32:31.755 --> 00:32:35.167
like navigation, forms,
and color contrasts,

00:32:35.358 --> 00:32:37.993
and you fix one or two things
with every release,

00:32:37.994 --> 00:32:40.496
over time, these all really stack up.

00:32:40.497 --> 00:32:44.305
Your user experience
will be much more inclusive.

00:32:44.568 --> 00:32:45.634
You can also become

00:32:45.635 --> 00:32:49.205
an advocate for accessibility
throughout the process.

00:32:49.206 --> 00:32:50.839
You might not be able to add

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.876
a full-time accessibility
expert to your team,

00:32:53.877 --> 00:32:56.979
but I'll bet you have students
or customers with disabilities

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.380
who would be happy to test out

00:32:58.381 --> 00:33:01.483
your website in order
to help make it better.

00:33:01.484 --> 00:33:04.987
You can also have your developer
team run experiments.

00:33:04.988 --> 00:33:08.558
Have them use only
their keyboard one morning.

00:33:08.658 --> 00:33:10.944
Have them turn on a colorblind add-on

00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:13.262
for their browser on another day.

00:33:13.263 --> 00:33:17.300
Keep reinforcing
that accessibility is inclusivity,

00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:19.633
and it benefits everyone.

00:33:19.736 --> 00:33:23.305
Remember to try
to reinforce ROI when you can.

00:33:23.306 --> 00:33:26.475
Maybe you fix a donation
form with a keyboard trap,

00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:28.544
and suddenly you can accept donations

00:33:28.545 --> 00:33:30.879
from a whole lot more people.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.715
Every little bit helps here,

00:33:32.716 --> 00:33:35.775
especially when you can get
a stakeholder's attention

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:38.712
to realize
this will benefit them too.

00:33:42.425 --> 00:33:44.994
On our next slide,
we have the heading

00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:46.731
"Build for everyone,"

00:33:46.863 --> 00:33:50.799
and a bullet point list
of the things we covered today:

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.770
skip link, strong contrast,

00:33:54.104 --> 00:33:57.374
landmarks, and semantic structure.

00:33:58.275 --> 00:34:01.010
If you only take
away one point today,

00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:03.946
I hope it's that
you can make a difference.

00:34:03.947 --> 00:34:07.816
Start wherever you can with whatever
tools you have.

00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:11.020
Commit to spending 10 minutes
a day testing websites

00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:13.756
or delving
into accessibility resources.

00:34:13.757 --> 00:34:16.392
That way, you're always
learning new tricks.

00:34:16.393 --> 00:34:18.227
As a developer, you should already

00:34:18.228 --> 00:34:20.496
be constantly scanning
for new technologies,

00:34:20.497 --> 00:34:23.565
so this really shouldn't
be anything new.

00:34:23.566 --> 00:34:25.880
Don't fixate on fancy tools.

00:34:26.102 --> 00:34:30.572
Often, the most powerful tools
a developer has are semantic tags

00:34:30.573 --> 00:34:32.352
that have been around for years,

00:34:32.353 --> 00:34:36.012
so browsers have built-in
functionality for them.

00:34:36.046 --> 00:34:38.747
You don't have to spend
your time reinventing the wheel.

00:34:38.748 --> 00:34:41.062
Just style them and move on.

00:34:41.718 --> 00:34:45.447
Accessibility is about progress,
not perfection.

00:34:45.555 --> 00:34:48.490
If you take even one
of these actions this week,

00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:51.982
you'll be making
your website more inclusive.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.664
We have come
to the end of our slides,

00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:59.632
and I think we've got
some time left for questions.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.521
Chris Hinds: All right.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.140
Wonderful.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.274
Thank you, Elaine,
and thank you, Kevin,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.619
for that wonderful presentation.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.746
We do indeed have a good amount
of time for some Q&amp;A,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:20.180
so hopefully, more folks can enter
some questions in the chat.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.900
I can say just from reputations

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.859
and from personal experience
with one of our speakers

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.239
that these two people
are incredibly knowledgeable

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.639
and the time they're giving
you here is incredibly valuable,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.924
so please get those questions
in if you have questions.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.419
All right.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.719
What I'd like to do first,

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.319
and you have pre-answered
these a little bit,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.939
but I want to give
you all an opportunity

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.171
to answer verbally as well.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.800
One person asked,
if you see untitled body or NAV,

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.519
I'm not sure if they meant NAV there,

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.080
when using the HTML5 outline plugin,
how do you fix that,

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.920
and is that missing
headings or missing ARIA?

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.299
Elaine Shannon:
It's missing headings,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.859
so any time you use those fancier--

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.220
well, fancier HTML5
is really not new,

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.979
it hasn't been for a while now.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.699
Any time you use those elements,
a section or a nav, not just a div,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.979
the browser is expecting there
to be a heading tag of some kind.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.339
Ideally, you're going to have an H1
and then an H2 and so forth,

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.040
but a heading tag
of any kind will fix that.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.119
Whatever its contents are,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.999
that will be the title
instead of the untitled body,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.562
untitled nav, untitled section.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.601
Chris Hinds: All right.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.039
What would you recommend
in terms of if we're going to--

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.599
like an accessibility
starter kit or something

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.959
like that for people
who are interested

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.639
in starting off
with audits or starting

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.480
to offer some accessibility
services themselves?

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.359
Elaine Shannon:
If you have no budget,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.559
you're being scrappy
and you just want to dip your toes

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.799
in the water and find out
some more and start fixing

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.719
the low-hanging fruit,
WebAIM has a tool called WAVE

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.719
that will let you check
one individual URL at a time.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.039
Obviously, that's going
to be a bit of a slow process

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.639
if you have a big site,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.839
but if you're inspecting
things like navigation,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.019
footers, anything site-wide,
you also can fix a lot of things

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.699
just from that one inspection,

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.379
and you can continue and just
manually inspect the next URL,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.779
the next URL, however many you have.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.379
That's a great way to dip
your toes in, get started for free.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.819
You don't have to sign
up for anything.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.439
You just download it and start
using it or use it in your browser.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.879
On the other hand, if you're trying
to offer services to clients

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.879
or really audit something
like Georgetown's hundreds

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.133
of websites, we use
tools like Siteimprove

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.519
or Equalize Digital has
a nice tool as well

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.119
that will automatically
spider crawl all your websites

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.959
and report to you on what
the accessibility problems are.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.559
A lot of times there's
also SEO modules, typos,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.799
things like that,
that they'll report on,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.199
so it's really easy
for you or your content

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.532
editors to then go
in and fix those things.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.359
The other benefit
of these automated tools

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.759
is you also get reporting built in,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.719
so you can really show,
especially if you're ever involved

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.879
in litigation or even just wanting

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.239
to show the ROI of, hey,
we've invested all this time,

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.079
what have we got to show for it?

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.039
You can show those graphs
and charts of here's how much

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.976
we've improved
these different facets.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.539
Chris Hinds: All right.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.899
We have some more questions
flowing in now.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.940
Emilio asks a tricky one.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.379
How could we convince
stakeholders these audits matter

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.378
a lot since they could increase
budget and the project timeline?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.779
Kevin Andrews: I can take that.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.779
Elaine Shannon: Stakeholder
buy-in is just a tricky--

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.619
Chris Hinds: [?] Kevin's perfect.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.319
Elaine Shannon: Go for it,
Kevin, please.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.679
Kevin Andrews: Can you say
the question one more time

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.854
for me just to make sure
I understood it?

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.699
Chris Hinds: A tricky one,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.939
but how could we
convince stakeholders

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.899
these audits matter a lot
since they could increase

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.710
budget and the project's timeline?

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.699
Kevin Andrews: Hopefully you
can all see and hear me here.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.399
I would say, I think
if you can get numbers

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.732
in front of them,
leadership wants numbers.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.279
There's all sorts of stuff out there.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.098
Google is your friend.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.246
Not everything on the Internet
is true, surprisingly.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.478
There are some good data out
there about this and how to really--

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.252
the math on these things
and making the business case.

00:39:43.253 --> 00:39:45.499
I won't sit there and rehash all that

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.140
for everyone here, but making

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.619
the case for we really need
this earlier in the process.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.899
We call that shifting left.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.100
I think it's an overused
term or phrase.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.279
If you can get
it earlier in the process,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.326
looking at accessibility
and the designs, of course,

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.699
that's all well and good,
but oftentimes, that's not the case.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.420
If you can make the case
to your leadership

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.539
as far as it's going to cost
us a lot less now

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.420
if we can try to do this proactively

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.105
rather than, now we're getting--

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.579
a company X or organization
X is getting sued

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.099
and now we have to deal with it.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.579
It's going to cost a lot more.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.659
Oftentimes, then you're trying

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.299
to retroactively address
a bunch of issues.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.819
I really encourage
people to do their research.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.020
Karl Groves has some
really good stuff

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.420
on this in particular about
the ROI of accessibility,

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.439
so you're not banging your head

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.439
against the wall and you're
not reinventing the wheel.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.279
There's a ton of stuff
on there already.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.960
I hope that helps.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.879
Chris Hinds: Super helpful.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.371
I want to jump over to Tom
Ostrai's question.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.974
Sorry if I butchered
the last name, Tom.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:14.119
Where can we find people to test
websites for accessibility issues?

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.690
What are some good reputable
sources for that?

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.359
Kevin Andrews: There are a lot
of companies out there

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.200
that say they do this.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.079
I would be very skeptical of anyone

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.040
touting ADA certification
that's not real.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.979
I've been doing
this for a long enough time

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.739
to know that that's BS.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.327
That's not real.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.879
If anyone is aware of that,
feel free to challenge me on that.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.920
ADA certification, we certify web--

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.079
that's not a thing.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.396
What I would say is you really want
to get feedback from your users.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.359
"We've never heard of our website
having accessibility problems."

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.759
Well, have you provided
the channels for that?

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.679
Have you provided a way or mechanism

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.806
by which people can make
their feedback known to you?

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.259
As far as actual companies,
again, Google is your friend.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.258
I don't endorse one over the other,
per se, as far as companies.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:24.180
I think there's a lot of benefit
to having real experts

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:29.498
who are screen-reader users
looking at your stuff and paying them

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.419
for the work because it is a field.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.619
It's a specialty like anything
else, like development,

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.619
design, security, that sort of thing.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.939
I think it's really
important that people

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.500
do get disabled users
looking at their product,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:49.816
their tool, whatever, and actually
compensating them appropriately.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.099
Chris Hinds: This
is actually a perfect segue,

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.280
I think, into Sherry
Robinson's question.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.819
Sherry asks, what
advice would you give

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.120
to someone who is CPACC?

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.439
For anyone in the audience
who isn't familiar,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.479
that's Certified Professional
in Accessibility Core Competencies,

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.659
which is a fairly
commonly-known certification

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.599
in the accessibility world.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.039
Someone who has that certification

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.679
but can't get a job due
to lack of experience.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.490
What advice would you give Sherry?

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.060
Kevin Andrews:
I would offer to do some--

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.939
I would say leverage
your connections,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.559
leverage your network.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.199
Who needs accessibility work done?

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.431
I would really talk to them

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.399
and offer any support
or guidance that you can.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.599
We all had to start somewhere.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.119
I've done my fair share.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.160
I did my fair share,
volunteer as it were.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.400
I think experience,
I know for those exams,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.679
experience can come
in many different forms.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.719
I think really leveraging
your network and your connections,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.000
"Hey, who in my local community
needs some work done?"

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.922
If you have development shops--

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.319
because the web
accessibility specialist one

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.880
is a very technical exam,
so if you want

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.999
to really get up on your HTML
and your ARIA, of course,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.094
number one rule
of ARIA is don't use it.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.619
This is a really tough market
right now to try to even break

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.419
into the field because of the current
climate so hostile to it.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.419
Leverage your network,
leverage your connections.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.625
That's probably what I would say
to that at this time.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.419
Chris Hinds: I actually
have a question,

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.639
and then hopefully,
we can get to one more after that.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.119
We've got a few minutes still.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.760
Both of you have been working
in WordPress for a while.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.759
I'm just curious, and hopefully,
some other people in the audience

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.079
might be curious about this,
too, how you're feeling

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.559
about the general direction
of the project in terms

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.460
of accessibility or just in general.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.499
Elaine Shannon:
That's quite a question.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.739
Not quite as much of a question

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.755
as it would have been
about a year ago.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.179
I have my doubts

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:21.300
about the way the project
is run and the way accessibility

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.740
is sometimes seemed
to be valued and other times left

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.996
as what seems
like an optional aspect.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.699
I think one of WordPress's
great strengths

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.683
is it's so customizable.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.219
It is easy to go
and build your own theme,

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.179
build your plugins,
add JavaScript here

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.019
and there as we heard
from another speaker

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.699
to fix things in Divi
that we know are not accessible

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.345
but can become so fairly easily.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.290
Chris Hinds: All right. Wonderful.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.599
Looks like we have time for one more.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.119
I thought this one was
particularly interesting.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.320
An anonymous attendee asks, Kevin,

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.119
you specifically mentioned your daily

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.759
struggles as part
of this presentation.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.639
We know that there are a lot
of bad experiences out there.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.620
Do you have some good sites
or good examples

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.259
that do accessibility
really well so that attendees can go

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.739
and look and see and test and learn
what a true proper implementation

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.100
of accessibility looks
like fundamentally?

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.399
Kevin Andrews: Sorry,
I keep getting alerts.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.399
I'm not used
to the webinar interface.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.127
I don't know what they're saying.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.420
Sorry.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.659
I would say I think a lot of the bank
websites do a really good job.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:55.180
I think there was a real push,
at least here in the States.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.262
I'm not sure where our audience
hails from on this session.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.859
I would say a lot of the banks
here in the US have done

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:08.140
some really good work
through threats imagined

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.579
or otherwise of litigation
or other reasons,

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.579
or maybe because they care.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.019
I don't really know, to be honest.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.700
That's not sarcasm.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.540
I think the banks do a nice job.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.579
The healthcare, the health
insurance conglomerates

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.739
seem to have it together,
at least the one that I have,

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.914
which is a pretty big
one here in the US.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:40.140
I think looking to those
who are really heavily

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.460
regulated still, again,
for better or worse,

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:51.320
still pretty regulated
and very much compliance focus,

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.100
and they have to really

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.806
follow these regulations.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.936
I would look at them.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.685
That's what I would say to that.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.740
Chris Hinds: Great.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.060
In 60 seconds or less, are there any,

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.659
and Sharon Rieger asked this,
are there any WordPress themes

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.299
that help get a good start
for an accessible website

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.791
if you can rapid fire
a name you're aware of?

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.159
Elaine Shannon: I unfortunately
have been building my own

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.762
for so long now, I'm not as familiar
with what's out there.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.979
Chris Hinds: All right.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.140
Thank you so much again for attending

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.554
this session with Elaine
and with Kevin.
