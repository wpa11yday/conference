00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:46.405

<v Janaki Konar>: Thank you.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:27.467
Greetings to everyone
listening to this talk.

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:33.204
Today, Fahad and I are going to talk
about "Built the Website with an AI,

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:35.019
but is it Accessible?

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:39.674
Exploring Accessibility
of AI-Generated Websites."

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.756
Before diving into this topic,

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:45.904
we'd like to give a gist of
the organization we come from,

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.198
BarrierBreak.

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:52.186
At BarrierBreak, we focus on
remediation and auditing of websites,

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.556
applications, documents,

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:57.295
authoring a VPAT,
performing design review,

00:02:57.315 --> 00:02:59.181
and creating playbooks,

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:02.398
along with products
such as A11yInspect,

00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:03.465
A11yNow,

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.742
and ACE Learning.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.874
Let's focus on today's agenda
for our talk.

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:17.102
Today, we are going to look into
what exactly is digital accessibility

00:03:17.122 --> 00:03:19.427
and why it is important.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.533
Creating a website
with an AI and its benefits.

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:26.364
We have identified
three different zones.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.547
Those are green, red, and yellow.

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:34.286
We will explore in detail
about these zones during our talk.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:40.139
We will see how to inspect, test,
and fix accessibility issues,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.593
along with a demo showing
how AllyInspect needs to be used

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:48.840
to check for accessibility bugs
on any webpage.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:52.848
Finally,
we will be sharing our conclusions.

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:59.292
Let's start by understanding
what digital accessibility is.

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.658
Accessibility means

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:08.194
creating a digital content, website,
applications, document, tools, systems,

00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:11.197
usable and understandable by everyone,

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.752
including people with disability.

00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:18.408
Creating a document
or creating a digital content accessible

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:22.862
need to make sure that
it is going to be inclusive

00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:25.861
and usable by everyone.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.955
Making a content digital
does not limit only

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.749
by focusing on people
with permanent disability,

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.531
but it should also help people
with situational disability.

00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.909
It should enhance
the overall user experience.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.920
For instance,

00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:49.911
we would have seen people
using a dark mode on their devices.

00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:54.813
Sometimes it is about preference,
but sometimes it is about need.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:59.237
For example,
people using a device in a dark mode

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:02.696
wherein they are
in a low-light condition.

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:05.991
Now, a dark mode becomes a necessity.

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:11.362
It helps in reducing the eye strain,
and it also help by providing

00:05:11.473 --> 00:05:15.294
a good readable view for the user.

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:19.589
To take another example,
we might have experienced a situation

00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:22.474
wherein we have to complete a task

00:05:22.494 --> 00:05:29.352
or maybe call an urgent person
for some reason,

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.173
and in this situation, we would not have
our glasses handy with us.

00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:37.585
In this situation,

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:43.142
features like text-to-speech
or a screen magnifier comes handy.

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:48.250
It helps us in completing the task
and making that urgent phone call.

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:51.186
Now, the next question is why?

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.931
Why create all digital content accessible?

00:05:55.178 --> 00:05:59.178
The main goal for creating
any digital content accessible

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:02.134
is to make sure everyone can use it,

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:05.535
everyone can interact
with the product,

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:11.366
and obviously, allowing
everyone to participate equally.

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:15.936
Also, in some region,
there are legal requirements.

00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:20.868
The digital product
must meet to specifically adhere

00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:23.829
to some accessibility standards.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.904
Now, apart from legal compliances,

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:36.098
making a digital content accessible also
comes in place to improve the brand value,

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:42.273
and it's also provide more values
in terms of business.

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:43.723
For example,

00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:46.454
it boosts the brand reputation

00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:49.414
by showing it it is inclusive,

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:52.816
it is based on users' need,

00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:56.674
and also it improves audience reach.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.403
It creates a customer base.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:05.615
Apart from all these benefits,
like enhancing SEOs,

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.047
creating a content accessible

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:10.783
is the right thing to do

00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:15.480
as it makes sure that
the product is usable by everyone

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.690
in different conditions
or situations.

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.209
Nowadays, we have seen a rise,

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:29.496
a major rise when it comes to
creating a web page

00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:33.923
or building a website
with the help of AI.

00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:40.226
AI is not limited only
by generating content,

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.787
but nowadays, it's very much in use

00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:47.276
in different stages
of website development.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:52.372
It can provide visuals,
like it can create icons,

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:54.421
it can create images.

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:59.765
It can provide suggestion
in terms of layouts, color schemes.

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:03.281
It writes code in HTML and CSS.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.427
All this can be just done

00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:09.239
with the help of a simple
plain language prompt

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.026
by a user.

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:17.869
It can also create a full-page content,
and again, just by a simple prompt.

00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:25.009
Such kind of AI tool simplifies
the work of a developer and a designer,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:30.724
but with that, it also opens the door
for a non-technical user.

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:35.709
Now, someone who is not well-versed
with development and designing,

00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:41.415
but can yet create a functional
and a well-structured website.

00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:45.150
Such kind of AI feature

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.610
helps especially small business
and individuals

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:54.117
who may not have a budget
or a resource to hire a full team.

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:57.314
With AI, they can yet create

00:08:57.338 --> 00:09:01.529
an online presence
independently and efficiently.

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:08.240
An example of a WordPress itself
has an AI assistant

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:13.826
which can be used
within the dashboard of WordPress.

00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:17.545
It gives different suggestions
to select layouts,

00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:19.810
to select color schemes,

00:09:19.841 --> 00:09:20.980
textiles.

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:26.611
It helps in giving suggestions
of adding different images.

00:09:26.986 --> 00:09:33.877
It can customize content,
sections, headlines, images.

00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:39.399
It can rewrite a content
based on different audience.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.732
In using a WordPress AI,
we can give a prompt.

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:48.617
It will build
an entire web page for us,

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:50.000
and even after that,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.975
if you want to make any edits
or maybe add any content,

00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:56.613
remove any content
or change something,

00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:01.973
yet can be done manually
as well as with an AI prompt.

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:07.654
This is beneficial
for freelancing agencies.

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:12.775
It becomes easier
for their project turnaround time

00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:17.497
because using an AI is faster
and it is easier,

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:22.447
and it is more adaptable
when it comes to dynamic changes.

00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:27.576
AI especially helps people
who often struggle on understanding

00:10:27.596 --> 00:10:31.279
where to start in terms of content

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.749
or in terms of understanding
the page structure or the layouts.

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:38.990
AI becomes a starting point.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.871
AI nowadays has turned
into a built-in guide

00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.096
in helping user to start with.

00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:53.455
AI is beneficial when it comes to
including the AI features

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:57.341
from the very beginning of the product
project stage.

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:04.416
There are more such AI website builders,
for example, Shopify, Wix, Squarespace,

00:11:04.436 --> 00:11:07.293
Hostinger, and there are many more.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.097
Having said that,

00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:16.847
AI definitely helps in generating
or creating a process or a project,

00:11:17.368 --> 00:11:22.520
but it does not guarantee
that the webpage that the AI has created

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.422
comes with 100% accessibility.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:29.672
There where we have identified few zones,

00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:35.419
and to talk more further about the zones,
I will hand it over to Fahad.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.539
< Fahad Lambate>: Thanks, Janaki,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.264
for sharing that information
about accessibility

00:11:47.284 --> 00:11:52.920
and also with regards to
what are the different tools

00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:57.684
that are available
to make a webpage using AI.

00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:00.546
Coming to the accessibility lens,

00:12:01.026 --> 00:12:05.516
which is about what AI is doing right

00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:09.256
when it comes to creating a webpage.

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:13.723
The first thing is about landmarks.

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:18.421
A landmark is
a basic structure of the webpage

00:12:18.444 --> 00:12:23.001
which needs to be done
right for various reasons,

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:27.198
especially for a screen-reading user
to understand

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.875
which part of the webpage
they are in.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.334
Are they in header,
in the main content, or the footer?

00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:36.038
This is something
which has been done right.

00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:37.563
We have used,

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:41.241
for this particular session,

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:44.637
the examples by creating a webpage

00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:47.465
through AI WordPress builder,

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:51.274
and all of the examples
are coming to that.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.618
The first thing is about landmarks,

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:57.009
and they have done it
right by using the header,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.240
main, and footer tag in the right places,

00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:02.989
which is a good thing.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.971
Apart from that,
when it comes to skip links,

00:13:05.996 --> 00:13:07.694
even that is done right,

00:13:08.068 --> 00:13:11.157
which is again a basic requirement
when it comes to accessibility,

00:13:11.177 --> 00:13:15.610
though it might be debatable,
not all webpages need a skip link

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.043
and all those things,

00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:19.380
and not always it is required,

00:13:19.617 --> 00:13:24.833
but I'll say it definitely improves
the usability of the webpage as well,

00:13:24.854 --> 00:13:28.004
especially when most
of the sites nowadays

00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:31.649
have a repetitive content
in the header section.

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:36.275
That skip to content
is really good to have

00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:40.565
and in certain cases
must have on the page.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:44.572
In this case, they have done it right
by adding it in the code,

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:50.723
which is available as soon as
the user focuses the skip link

00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:51.917
using the keyboard,

00:13:52.137 --> 00:13:57.943
and on activating the skip link,
the focus goes to the main page,

00:13:58.116 --> 00:13:59.869
the main content of the page.

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:02.643
This is something
which is done right.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.726
Simple expand/collapse controls.

00:14:06.606 --> 00:14:12.146
Here I'll just give a disclaimer
because not every time this work,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.407
but when it worked, it worked well.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.127
I'll give you both the examples.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.468
The first thing what worked well is

00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:24.859
when we were trying to give prompts
to create a hamburger menu.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.734
It created a simple hamburger menu,

00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:32.554
a button which is opening
or collapsing the menu

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.674
when the viewport is smaller.

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:38.128
This particular button had a good label,
which said,

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.040
"Open menu and close menu,"

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.986
depending on what state
that menu was.

00:14:43.223 --> 00:14:46.139
Also, a native button element was used.

00:14:47.124 --> 00:14:50.508
In addition to that,
whatever was expanding on this menu,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:56.359
it was also keeping the focus
within that menu and the button itself,

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:00.806
and not going in the background content,
which was again good addition.

00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:04.893
In certain cases,
when we tried to create

00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:09.100
an expand/collapse for the control,
which is more of an accordion.

00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:11.822
Over there, the AI struggled

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:15.453
because many times with certain prompts

00:15:15.473 --> 00:15:21.791
or with additional prompts also,
that accordion was unable

00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:25.970
to be accessible using the keyboard

00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:29.231
because it was not giving
the keyboard support to it.

00:15:29.258 --> 00:15:32.691
It was just giving
a plain structure to it,

00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:37.421
like visually it might just appear
that it is an accordion,

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:42.566
but there was no interactiveness
to that particular element.

00:15:42.699 --> 00:15:46.747
In this particular case,
even after additional prompt,

00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:49.126
the AI was unable to improve it.

00:15:51.009 --> 00:15:52.014
The color contrast,

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:58.879
I'll say this is the most constant thing

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:00.498
which was done right

00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:03.712
when it comes to building
a website using an AI,

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:07.500
because it is also depending on
what theme you choose.

00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:11.834
If you prompt for accessible color theme
for the webpage,

00:16:11.994 --> 00:16:14.752
it will give you
a good options of colors

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:19.155
which will help to give
a good contrast to your webpage.

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:23.892
In this case,
we chose a simple contrast,

00:16:23.912 --> 00:16:27.370
which is a mixture of
white, black, orange,

00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:29.124
and so on colors.

00:16:29.845 --> 00:16:32.818
In this screenshot,
there is a "join now' button,

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:36.458
which is having an orange background
and a black text.

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:40.618
Similarly, other content
on the webpage mostly is in

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:44.072
black background
with white text or vice versa.

00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:46.995
It is having a contrast ratio
in this case,

00:16:47.046 --> 00:16:49.649
the white and black as 21:1,

00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:54.664
which is more than enough to meet
the color contrast requirement.

00:16:57.264 --> 00:16:59.068
When it comes to form,

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:03.799
so form was also
having few good things about it

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.216
because when it comes
to the programmatically defined labels,

00:17:08.274 --> 00:17:09.711
those were done right.

00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:12.334
It was done using the basic method,

00:17:12.382 --> 00:17:16.449
and it was good to see not overuse
of ARIA was there over here

00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:19.170
because using a label

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.993
and for ID association
with the input tag,

00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:27.718
it was done right to provide a solution
between the label and the field.

00:17:28.118 --> 00:17:32.236
Similarly, mandatory fields
were done also right.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.470
Whichever fields are mandatory,

00:17:34.674 --> 00:17:37.734
we're having a required keyword
in the label.

00:17:38.738 --> 00:17:40.806
When it comes to the input

00:17:40.838 --> 00:17:44.171
that was used or any form control
that was used,

00:17:44.205 --> 00:17:48.268
it was having required=true
and ARIA-required=true as well.

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:51.622
I know maybe both
are not necessarily needed,

00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:53.436
but it was a good addition.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.886
For screen reader user,
it will be important

00:17:57.089 --> 00:18:02.193
that if they miss reading
required keyword for some reason,

00:18:02.307 --> 00:18:04.294
at least it will have ARIA-required=true,

00:18:04.314 --> 00:18:08.020
which will make them understand
if it's a requirment.

00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:11.751
Another thing about the form

00:18:11.771 --> 00:18:17.758
was the programmatically
defined label error messages.

00:18:18.303 --> 00:18:22.273
The error messages
that was used in this case,

00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:23.376
there is screenshot,

00:18:23.396 --> 00:18:26.389
which is having the form
with name, email,

00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:29.396
and message field,
email being the required field,

00:18:29.556 --> 00:18:33.128
and it is having an inline error message
for this email field.

00:18:33.522 --> 00:18:36.805
There is also a standard error message,
which is there

00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:40.071
towards the end of the form,
just before the send button,

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.458
"Please fill out the form correctly."

00:18:42.505 --> 00:18:44.000
Obviously, that is debatable

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.473
because the location
of that standard text is not right

00:18:49.013 --> 00:18:52.022
because it should ideally be
at the top of the form.

00:18:52.517 --> 00:18:53.637
At the same time,

00:18:53.729 --> 00:18:57.264
the inline error message
was done right at least.

00:18:57.617 --> 00:19:02.549
It was having also
an ARIA-invalid=true attribute

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.978
for the field, which was an error,
and it was good to see that.

00:19:06.054 --> 00:19:09.074
Plus the focus was going
to the field with error,

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.767
the first field with error.

00:19:10.887 --> 00:19:13.146
That was also a good addition to it,

00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:17.250
such that user
don't have to forcefully go back

00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:21.355
and they can be automatically taken
to that.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:29.172
Also, they have used
ARIA error message attribute

00:19:29.193 --> 00:19:30.392
on this field,

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.224
which was, again,

00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:34.411
not necessarily completely robust,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:40.369
but they have at least tried to use it
and pass on the ID of the field,

00:19:40.389 --> 00:19:44.016
which is all the error message text
that is there.

00:19:44.525 --> 00:19:45.766
Due to that,

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:49.032
it was accessible as well.

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:57.075
Coming to the basic requirement
of the structure is again a list.

00:19:57.135 --> 00:20:02.006
This was also done pretty well
across most of the page content.

00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:05.165
In this case,
there is an example of a FIGURE section

00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:09.590
which is having navigation links,
which are related to each other,

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.331
and a set of social media links.

00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:15.910
They both were separately coded
as a list structure,

00:20:15.952 --> 00:20:21.788
and appropriately, the UL, LI
was used to code this.

00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:31.329
Now, since we have seen some
of the accessibility events,

00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:36.244
there could be obviously
accessibility misses by AI,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.667
and that is bound to happen
when it comes to AI.

00:20:42.725 --> 00:20:45.108
I would want to say is,

00:20:45.183 --> 00:20:48.117
accessibility is not something
like a checkbox,

00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:49.684
like, "if you give a prompt

00:20:49.714 --> 00:20:54.199
that make an accessible web page
or make an accessible component,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.803
it will give you directly the result."

00:20:57.097 --> 00:21:02.366
You have to give specific prompts,
and in certain cases,

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:06.799
those prompts might not even guarantee
the accessibility of the event.

00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:11.693
You have to actually understand
that it's accessible by trying it out,

00:21:12.185 --> 00:21:15.380
by testing the page,
understanding if it's accessible or not,

00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:18.048
the component that has been created.

00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:21.368
It's really a hit
and miss in a lot of places.

00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:24.843
The one example
which I told about the accordion,

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:30.265
so that was really
the most important one,

00:21:30.286 --> 00:21:34.406
because if you're creating
an accessible accordion,

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:40.111
asking such prompts to the AI,
it should ideally give you such output,

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:41.925
which was not the case.

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:44.124
I'm sure there would be
other components as well,

00:21:44.144 --> 00:21:47.063
which will have such problems too.

00:21:48.639 --> 00:21:51.505
When you're trying to build
an accessible page,

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:54.410
it won't have accessibility
by default.

00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:58.668
Whatever content you're using on the page,
what is the purpose of that content?

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:00.322
It really depends

00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:05.513
what all needs to be accessible
in such cases.

00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:09.823
Now, let's have a look
at some of the common examples

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.380
when the AI was not giving
the right output

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.268
when trying to use even
as much as accurate prompts possible.

00:22:20.398 --> 00:22:22.912
The first thing was
about color contrast.

00:22:22.933 --> 00:22:27.839
I know I told about the color contrast
being commonly done right,

00:22:27.982 --> 00:22:29.792
but there were also instances

00:22:29.812 --> 00:22:32.349
where the color contrast
was not done right,

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:35.362
if you choose the wrong theme,

00:22:35.589 --> 00:22:37.409
or even in certain cases,

00:22:37.749 --> 00:22:40.009
it might say it's accessible.

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.562
Maybe the text which is used

00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:46.498
and the background color might be
accessible in most of the places,

00:22:46.582 --> 00:22:49.322
but definitely in certain scenarios,
it will fail.

00:22:49.362 --> 00:22:52.559
Here, this example is
about an error message text

00:22:52.612 --> 00:22:55.342
wherein the red color error message text

00:22:55.362 --> 00:23:00.155
is failing the contrast ratio requirement
against the background color,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.200
as it's coming to around 1.86:1.

00:23:05.987 --> 00:23:07.493
Non-meaningful links.

00:23:07.513 --> 00:23:12.417
What is happening over here
is there are multiple same type of links

00:23:12.438 --> 00:23:13.438
that is present.

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:17.731
This will definitely happen
if you're trying to create a blog website

00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:23.008
or wherein there will be multiple articles
or maybe even product websites,

00:23:23.062 --> 00:23:24.854
wherein there will be
multiple products,

00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:27.481
and you want to redirect
to a certain page.

00:23:27.729 --> 00:23:30.863
In such cases,
what you will also see is

00:23:31.282 --> 00:23:35.336
this is not having a meaningful text.

00:23:35.365 --> 00:23:37.298
It is just saying "join now."

00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:40.465
There is no additional context to it.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.759
There is one more issue over here.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.896
We'll talk about this
in the later part.

00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:47.241
We'll come to that as well.

00:23:47.273 --> 00:23:50.653
I'm sure everyone might be thinking,
"Hey, that is not an issue."

00:23:50.674 --> 00:23:52.416
I'll come to that.

00:23:52.882 --> 00:23:58.670
Also, when it comes to
the heading hierarchy mistakes,

00:23:58.759 --> 00:24:01.411
that is also bound to happen with AI.

00:24:02.486 --> 00:24:04.429
What we have seen is

00:24:04.642 --> 00:24:08.545
when it comes to the creating
any particular web page

00:24:08.565 --> 00:24:10.429
using this AI tool,

00:24:11.189 --> 00:24:16.051
so at a section having
the logo link image,

00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:20.625
which takes generally to the home page
of this page of the website.

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.253
It is also coded using an H1
in all the pages,

00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:26.099
which is again incorrect.

00:24:26.193 --> 00:24:28.173
It shouldn't be an H1 in all pages.

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:33.365
H1 basically should be
what will describe the page content.

00:24:34.523 --> 00:24:38.270
It will differ from page to page
on that website.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.016
Similarly,
though it is not mentioned over here,

00:24:41.037 --> 00:24:44.354
but I will say
we have also found certain areas

00:24:44.374 --> 00:24:48.681
where there was
a big font size text used,

00:24:48.834 --> 00:24:50.647
but it was also given a heading.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.965
Again, that was not needed
and unnecessarily used.

00:24:56.512 --> 00:24:58.908
That is also a challenge.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.200
Another thing is about images.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.044
This will always be bound
to be a topic of discussion

00:25:06.064 --> 00:25:08.213
because images are always subjective.

00:25:08.664 --> 00:25:10.035
We have found instances

00:25:10.055 --> 00:25:15.102
about incomplete alternative text
and also inaccurate alternative text.

00:25:15.415 --> 00:25:20.955
In incomplete, there was an image stating
about the daily specials of artisan bread

00:25:20.975 --> 00:25:23.098
and different types of breads were there.

00:25:23.145 --> 00:25:25.548
It spoke about a part of it,

00:25:25.568 --> 00:25:28.882
but what are the types of breads
and the prices for that?

00:25:28.907 --> 00:25:32.094
It's never mentioned
in the whole text.

00:25:32.314 --> 00:25:36.800
In addition to this,
there was an image which is subjective.

00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:40.729
It could be decorative or informative,
depending on the business needs,

00:25:41.902 --> 00:25:46.346
but the art was given just as a bakery,
wherein visually it is just

00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.848
a basket consisting
different types of breads.

00:25:52.853 --> 00:25:57.383
Remember,
we spoke about informative links.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.058
For such links,
as well as other links,

00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:07.345
it was coded using an anchor tag,
but it was not having a keyboard support.

00:26:07.394 --> 00:26:09.965
If I go back to that example again,

00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:11.954
even in this code,
you'll see there's an anchor,

00:26:11.974 --> 00:26:15.281
but there's no href provided for it.

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:20.703
Then that's an again accessibility issue
about missing keyboard support.

00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:27.888
Also, if you have any questions,
obviously, you can drop in chat

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:30.553
and we'll try to respond

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:37.415
as we go through the session
and address those as fast as possible

00:26:37.435 --> 00:26:38.848
as we could.

00:26:39.778 --> 00:26:44.112
Now, since we have seen
the red zone and the green zone

00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:45.839
when it comes to AI,

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:48.235
there is an in-between zone,

00:26:48.384 --> 00:26:51.578
which we have termed it
as yellow zone,

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:58.444
wherein we want to highlight
that manual testing or a manual review

00:26:58.488 --> 00:27:02.894
is needed to bridge the gap
between the accessibility

00:27:03.199 --> 00:27:04.814
when it comes to AI.

00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:08.846
A human review is a must,

00:27:08.904 --> 00:27:13.162
even if you're using a tool
that will give you certain issues.

00:27:13.672 --> 00:27:19.367
Even when the tool that we have released
or we have created,

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:22.710
that tool, which is called A11yInspect,

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.627
that will be a demo
later on towards the end.

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:30.730
Even in that particular tool,
I'll say we don't necessarily say

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.967
it is a 100% detection tool
for accessibility issues.

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.271
Any good accessibility professional

00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:44.370
will always give me an advice that
AI won't detect 100% accessibility issues.

00:27:44.555 --> 00:27:46.702
A human intervention is needed

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.386
because a lot of the success criterias
are subjective.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.385
They are requiring a manual decision

00:27:53.546 --> 00:27:55.815
that if it's an error or not,

00:27:57.243 --> 00:28:03.977
because when it comes to manual
review - I mean - AI testing,

00:28:04.014 --> 00:28:06.806
it only catches 30% to 40% of the issue.

00:28:06.827 --> 00:28:08.613
That is also the threshold.

00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:10.664
Even in this 30%, 40%,

00:28:10.684 --> 00:28:13.387
you will need some validation
to be done manually

00:28:13.407 --> 00:28:16.495
to ensure that is an issue or not.

00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:21.869
Manual review will also help you
understand the context-related problems.

00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:23.793
We also spoke about image,

00:28:23.813 --> 00:28:27.152
wherein it could be decorative
or informative.

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:30.792
Apart from that,
the dynamic updating context

00:28:30.812 --> 00:28:34.399
that definitely needs
a fully manual review.

00:28:34.772 --> 00:28:38.770
You need to understand
what is the dynamic updates happening,

00:28:38.844 --> 00:28:41.888
what are the areas or the places

00:28:41.905 --> 00:28:46.439
where an accessibility
is a requirement,

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:51.822
so that it can be bridged
for accessibility challenges.

00:28:53.904 --> 00:28:57.074
An example would be
a simple modal dialogue.

00:28:57.394 --> 00:29:00.567
When a modal dialogue
is open or closed,

00:29:00.712 --> 00:29:03.609
the focus management
needs to be appropriate.

00:29:04.095 --> 00:29:06.226
Focus should go to the modal dialogue

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:08.638
when it's open,
it should stay within the dialogue.

00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:09.674
When it's closed,

00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:12.419
the focus should go back
to the triggering element.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.629
All these things AI can't detect.

00:29:14.692 --> 00:29:19.573
That needs to happen manually
if it's happening in the right manner.

00:29:19.987 --> 00:29:22.383
I'll say it's a mixture of AI

00:29:22.403 --> 00:29:27.433
and manual testing or manual review,
which will complete your evaluation.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:34.539
I'm not talking this because I'm working
in an accessibility-oriented organization

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.985
where we are providing services,

00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:40.311
when it comes to audit
and other things as well.

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:45.175
You need people with disabilities
involved in this evaluation.

00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:48.643
Otherwise,
your evaluation will be incomplete.

00:29:48.696 --> 00:29:54.273
The perspective that
the actual user will bring to the table

00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:55.780
will be invaluable.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.276
We have been doing that

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:02.073
since we went into
the accessibility space.

00:30:02.246 --> 00:30:03.247
Since at the start,

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.827
we have always included people
with disabilities in our auditing.

00:30:09.304 --> 00:30:12.214
Some of the benefits that a manual review

00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:16.711
will help you is with checking
for keyboard navigation.

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.134
Be it the keyboard operability,

00:30:19.454 --> 00:30:21.381
be it the focus indicator,

00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:24.943
if it is rightly done
for the interactive elements,

00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:28.370
if they have the sufficient contrast
or not,

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:32.761
and also if the focus
is managed appropriately or not,

00:30:32.996 --> 00:30:35.527
be it the programmatic focus,

00:30:35.543 --> 00:30:38.146
like when dynamic interactions
are happening,

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:41.632
or be it the logical reading order
or focus order,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:47.555
which needs to be ideally
from left to right and top to bottom.

00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:52.993
When it comes to images,
as I mentioned, the alt text,

00:30:53.013 --> 00:30:55.066
definitely the AI
can help you with it,

00:30:55.073 --> 00:30:58.211
but whatever the information
is given in the alt,

00:30:58.231 --> 00:31:01.089
that has to be manually vetted
and understood

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:04.051
that if it is correct, you give it one.

00:31:04.576 --> 00:31:07.789
That is done using manual review.

00:31:08.076 --> 00:31:09.876
The heading structures, again,

00:31:10.189 --> 00:31:12.222
it needs to be manually vetted

00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:17.955
because, based on the context of the page,
the heading hierarchy will differ a lot,

00:31:18.026 --> 00:31:21.526
and you need to be ensuring

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:25.954
that heading hierarchy is correct,
not just based on the size of the text,

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:29.255
but based on the content
that is used.

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:39.706
These were some of the points
about yellow zone, red zone,

00:31:39.726 --> 00:31:42.026
or green zone when it comes to AI.

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:50.149
The further agenda of this session

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.696
will be continued by Janaki.

00:31:52.776 --> 00:31:55.166
Janaki, over to you.

00:31:58.254 --> 00:31:59.537
<v Janaki Konar>: Thank you, Fahad.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.635
As now we know what are the things

00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:04.454
that an AI can take care
in terms of accessibility,

00:32:04.474 --> 00:32:07.456
and why there is a need
of manual testing

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:10.921
as well as performing
automated tools testing.

00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:13.408
Let's understand the execution plan.

00:32:13.428 --> 00:32:17.689
First, we would run an automated tool
on a webpage

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.755
to identify, to inspect,

00:32:19.778 --> 00:32:22.390
or analyze the entire code

00:32:22.405 --> 00:32:25.455
and identifying the issues
related to code.

00:32:26.098 --> 00:32:28.878
The next step would be
to do a manual testing.

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:31.795
With the help of keyboard
as well as screen reader,

00:32:31.879 --> 00:32:36.130
we would be navigating
the entire page to identify any issues

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.069
that was not identified by our tool

00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:44.331
and the issues that are related
to more of human judgment.

00:32:44.508 --> 00:32:48.636
Something that would be accessible
as per the standards,

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:52.441
but it won't be that readable enough
or that clear enough for a user.

00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:54.416
To enhance the user experience,

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:58.321
manual testing
would cover all those areas.

00:32:59.174 --> 00:33:03.777
For example, if an automated tool
has identified a bug of color

00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:08.859
not meeting the requirement
of color contrast for a text,

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:13.836
we can adjust the color combination
in a way that it meets the requirement

00:33:13.856 --> 00:33:14.975
as per the standard

00:33:14.996 --> 00:33:18.326
as well as it ensures that
it is clearly readable enough

00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:22.023
for every user in different modes,
in different backgrounds,

00:33:22.185 --> 00:33:26.773
so that no one has
any difficulty understanding the text.

00:33:27.888 --> 00:33:32.669
If we have multiple interactive elements,
such as link on a webpage,

00:33:32.832 --> 00:33:36.927
the tool can definitely identify
if the link text is not clear enough,

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:40.489
it is weak, for example,
learn more, read more,

00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:43.236
or maybe a repetitive product name.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:49.195
A manual intervention is required here
to understand the text is clear enough.

00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:52.550
It helps user understand its purpose,

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:55.592
even when they are reading
out of context.

00:33:56.172 --> 00:33:58.023
A tool can definitely identify

00:33:58.043 --> 00:34:02.038
if the heading structure
is not appropriate, for example,

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:05.911
after a heading level H2,
if the page has H4.

00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:10.688
Tool will definitely identify
and let know that H3 was skipped.

00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.412
At the same time,

00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:13.590
while fixing it,

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.930
we have to understand
whether the text H4

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.834
would needs to be updated
to H3 or H2,

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:24.236
or in fact, it does not have to be
a heading at all.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.580
Similar is the case
when we talk about images.

00:34:28.756 --> 00:34:30.803
A tool can help understand

00:34:30.824 --> 00:34:33.664
whether a particular element
has a textual description

00:34:33.684 --> 00:34:36.649
or it does not have
a textual description at all,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.436
but to identify, to judge whether
a particular image is a decorative

00:34:41.456 --> 00:34:43.392
or whether it is informative.

00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:45.102
If it is informative,

00:34:45.135 --> 00:34:49.670
what kind of information is required
to be covered in the textual description

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:53.958
that will help user instead
of having unwanted information

00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:56.714
to be part of the textual descriptions.

00:34:57.318 --> 00:35:00.563
Finally, testing the entire page
with the help of keyboard

00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:03.470
and screen reader is definitely required

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.607
to understand if a user
can complete the entire journey,

00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:13.969
to understand if every interactive element
can be reachable, can be operable.

00:35:14.204 --> 00:35:18.752
The focus indicator that appears
for interactive element is clearly visible

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:21.851
so that a user know
where their focus is.

00:35:21.884 --> 00:35:25.414
If there is a dynamic content,
like something is updated,

00:35:25.738 --> 00:35:29.008
whether it is announced clearly
so that user knows

00:35:29.029 --> 00:35:31.106
what has happened on the page.

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:35.548
This is our plan, our execution steps

00:35:35.568 --> 00:35:39.709
to ensure that
the product that we release is tested,

00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:43.313
and it is also accessible
for all the users.

00:35:43.326 --> 00:35:47.410
Let's see a demo
of an automated tools

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:51.965
to understand
how it can help us identify the issues.

00:35:53.036 --> 00:35:55.762
For today, we are going to focus
on A11yInspect.

00:35:55.783 --> 00:35:57.966
First, we have to install it
from webstore.

00:35:57.986 --> 00:36:02.572
Once that is done, we will be able
to access the bookmarklets of A11yInspect

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:06.693
as well as we will be able
to run through our page.

00:36:07.346 --> 00:36:10.805
A11y can be found
within the developer tools,

00:36:10.945 --> 00:36:15.129
and we can then navigate
to A11yInspect tab.

00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:19.780
Here I have already run this scan,
but let me do it again.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.061
I'll just refresh this.

00:36:23.209 --> 00:36:26.034
The first tab shows a dropdown

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.231
wherein we have multiple elements.

00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:30.486
If we want to focus
on one certain element,

00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:33.380
like a form, dialog or color,
we can select that,

00:36:33.497 --> 00:36:37.352
or we can select A11yInspect
and click on test now.

00:36:38.512 --> 00:36:40.910
It gives me an overview
that this particular webpage

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:46.151
that I have created with the help of AI
has 5 issue types and 9 issues,

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:50.104
and there are validate of 14 issue type
and 28 issues.

00:36:52.192 --> 00:36:56.252
This also is displayed
in a form of WCAG conformance level.

00:36:56.273 --> 00:37:02.457
Out of 9, 8 fail under level A
and 1 fail under level AA.

00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:07.050
To view more detail of these issues,
we'll click on the fail tab.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.939
It shows all the issues
along with its severity.

00:37:11.508 --> 00:37:14.880
Here, let's focus on the blocker issue,
which has 3 issues.

00:37:15.561 --> 00:37:19.064
This is about link fails
to receive keyboard focus.

00:37:19.306 --> 00:37:22.091
The instances name are present,
as well as it shows

00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:27.271
that it falls under WCAG 2.1.1
success criteria.

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:30.927
If I click on the ID of this instance,

00:37:30.947 --> 00:37:34.916
the page will scroll to show
where it exactly is present,

00:37:34.968 --> 00:37:38.079
as well as the code
of that particular instance.

00:37:38.358 --> 00:37:42.270
This is coded with the help of anchor tab,
but there is no other attribute

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.361
that ensure that
it receives keyboard focus.

00:37:45.918 --> 00:37:49.300
To take a screenshot of this instance
and to highlight this instance,

00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:52.594
we can directly click
on the download element present here,

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:56.485
and it will save an image
in our download folders.

00:37:57.681 --> 00:38:00.176
Now, let's try understand
what is validate.

00:38:00.243 --> 00:38:05.017
Validate is something that
it has all the issue types

00:38:05.037 --> 00:38:07.335
which requires manual written.

00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:09.849
To take one example,

00:38:09.869 --> 00:38:13.714
we have verified the image has
an accurate textual description.

00:38:13.734 --> 00:38:17.519
There are 5 issues,
and the severity is major.

00:38:17.938 --> 00:38:20.439
It shows all the image
that has alternate text

00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:24.789
and what text is present
within the alternate text.

00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:26.859
It says that all is working.

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:29.770
I have 3 images
with the same alternate text,

00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:34.615
and there are couple of more image
with a lot of textual description.

00:38:35.178 --> 00:38:37.929
If I click on it,
I understand it's a decorative image,

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:41.606
but the entire thing
that is visible on the image is

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:43.516
part of the textual description.

00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:46.195
The next tab is of suggestion.

00:38:46.215 --> 00:38:47.581
There is one suggestion

00:38:47.601 --> 00:38:50.292
that says image content
multiple heading level,

00:38:50.317 --> 00:38:52.124
and there are two h1s.

00:38:52.157 --> 00:38:53.614
It's a best practice,

00:38:53.634 --> 00:38:56.351
and it is showing me that
the page has h1

00:38:56.386 --> 00:38:59.347
with the exact same text
that is spoken in it.

00:39:00.323 --> 00:39:02.586
One of the h1s
is present on the header,

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.870
and the next h1
is present on the footer.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.977
Now, this requires a manual review

00:39:06.997 --> 00:39:10.410
to understand what kind of adjustment
needs to be done here.

00:39:12.318 --> 00:39:15.075
The next one shows
the entire page structure

00:39:15.108 --> 00:39:18.008
that is all the landmarks,
all the headings,

00:39:18.028 --> 00:39:20.471
along with its text and its level.

00:39:21.073 --> 00:39:24.953
I now know that the page
has footer, main, and header,

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.739
along with form,

00:39:26.806 --> 00:39:29.588
but yes, there are multiple banners
that are coded,

00:39:29.698 --> 00:39:32.833
so need to ensure
whether it is really required

00:39:32.873 --> 00:39:37.008
or is it incorrect
and what kind of changes required there.

00:39:38.624 --> 00:39:42.401
The next is color contrast tab,
wherein we can use the color picker

00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:44.755
or we can give an input value

00:39:44.775 --> 00:39:50.461
that is the HEX code or RGB color
of the foreground as well as background,

00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:53.939
which then will give us
a contrast ratio

00:39:53.959 --> 00:39:57.469
as well as will let us know
whether it meets the standard large text

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:02.357
or non-text by double A
as well as by triple A.

00:40:04.334 --> 00:40:06.625
The next one is CSS overview tab.

00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:13.011
This is something that is going to be
very helpful for a UX and UI person.

00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:15.992
This tab shows
all the color combination used

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:19.293
that is all the color
foreground and background color,

00:40:19.393 --> 00:40:24.463
the text size used on the entire web page,
the text family.

00:40:24.947 --> 00:40:27.353
Then it shows you
what needs to be avoided,

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.256
what combination needs to be avoided

00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:32.185
to meet standard
and large text requirement.

00:40:32.653 --> 00:40:35.704
This is going to be very helpful
while designing this web page on

00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:37.994
what we should not be doing

00:40:38.014 --> 00:40:40.700
or what color combination
we should not pick.

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:44.748
The next one is a unit converter.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:48.553
You can provide a unit and the size,

00:40:48.573 --> 00:40:50.603
and then get it converted

00:40:50.623 --> 00:40:54.779
to identify or to find
what is the size of that particular text

00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:57.032
or a container in a different unit.

00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:02.215
Few more controls
that we have at the top is

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.170
if we want to re-scan,
we can click on the "refresh" button.

00:41:05.204 --> 00:41:08.871
If you want to export all the file names,
you can export it,

00:41:08.939 --> 00:41:12.827
as well as there is another control
of pause script.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.218
We have seen certain elements
that are coded with the help of scripts,

00:41:17.265 --> 00:41:22.306
and to inspect the code of that
particular element becomes a challenge,

00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:24.897
because the moment
we click somewhere to inspect

00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:26.793
the particular element code,

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:30.413
the content gets collapsed
or it disappears from the page,

00:41:30.434 --> 00:41:34.928
and it is highly impossible
to find the code of the element.

00:41:35.157 --> 00:41:37.988
In such cases,
we can click on the pause script.

00:41:38.238 --> 00:41:42.285
Instead of writing the script manually,
we can directly click on a button.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.901
It writes the code for us,

00:41:44.929 --> 00:41:49.346
and then we can manually check
the code of that particular element.

00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:52.068
We can click on "resume" script execution,

00:41:52.097 --> 00:41:56.904
such that we can again use
or interact with our website.

00:41:57.777 --> 00:41:58.806
Apart from this,

00:41:58.827 --> 00:42:02.973
we also have bookmarklets
present in A11yInspect.

00:42:03.273 --> 00:42:05.139
Let's have a look at it.

00:42:05.341 --> 00:42:07.021
Once we click on bookmarklet,

00:42:07.078 --> 00:42:09.712
there are multiple options present,

00:42:09.817 --> 00:42:12.805
and we can click multiple at a time

00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:15.554
or maybe single
based on how it is required.

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.954
Let's click on list, as we know
we have a structure on the page,

00:42:18.974 --> 00:42:23.421
and here we see it is provided accurately,
like UL and LI.

00:42:24.592 --> 00:42:26.983
If we select table

00:42:27.432 --> 00:42:29.789
and let's go to the table structure

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:31.562
and here it is.

00:42:31.861 --> 00:42:35.115
I can see that our table
is coded with table,

00:42:35.169 --> 00:42:36.817
tbody, tr, et cetera,

00:42:36.838 --> 00:42:42.075
but there is no th element
for the table headers.

00:42:42.195 --> 00:42:45.792
This helps identifying
or understanding the structure,

00:42:45.899 --> 00:42:47.752
the code of an element.

00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:50.851
This was all about the tool.

00:42:50.882 --> 00:42:55.258
Let's proceed
with our conclusion of the day.

00:42:56.733 --> 00:42:58.581
Using an AI, definitely,

00:42:58.601 --> 00:43:03.324
it is going to boost the speed
of creating a website.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.489
It will write the code,
it will structure the page.

00:43:06.601 --> 00:43:11.394
It will also ensure that accessibility
is taken care to a certain amount,

00:43:11.553 --> 00:43:15.966
but definitely, it does not guarantee
a complete accessibility.

00:43:17.098 --> 00:43:20.444
That becomes a need
of testing a web page

00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:23.336
with the help of tool
as well as manual review

00:43:23.432 --> 00:43:27.945
such that all the code-related
or the user benefit issues

00:43:27.966 --> 00:43:31.671
are identified and those are fixed.

00:43:32.098 --> 00:43:34.041
Lastly, we have to keep in mind

00:43:34.061 --> 00:43:36.428
that accessibility is not a checklist,

00:43:36.448 --> 00:43:40.186
something that you do it once
and then you forget it completely.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.440
It is something
that needs to be evolved

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.533
as we evolve our content,

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.337
we add certain thing on a web page
or whenever a text tag is updated,

00:43:49.442 --> 00:43:51.034
depending on the user needs.

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.365
Accessibility needs to be reviewed
again and again.

00:43:54.846 --> 00:44:00.152
We also have to make sure that
our product is accessible for everyone.

00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:05.531
With that, thank you so much
for giving us this opportunity.

00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:09.580
Here, we have a few details
on contacting us,

00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:11.045
me and Fahad.

00:44:11.793 --> 00:44:13.601
You can find this information.

00:44:14.674 --> 00:44:17.034
Now we are open for our questions.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Chris Hinds>: All right,

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.700
thank you very much,

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.699
Janaki and Fahad
for that wonderful presentation.

00:44:29.322 --> 00:44:32.905
Just a friendly reminder for everyone,
you can use the Q&amp;A feature

00:44:32.906 --> 00:44:36.877
here in Zoom webinars to submit questions
now that the talk has concluded,

00:44:36.951 --> 00:44:39.691
or you could have submitted them any time.

00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:45.469
We're going to answer as many questions
as we can in the next five minutes or so.

00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:49.460
I am going to go ahead and dive right in.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.240
I have a couple of my questions,
but I'm going to try to prioritize

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.179
audience questions first, so...

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.880
Let's see here.

00:45:00.797 --> 00:45:01.797
All right.

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:06.170
You mentioned that you had to do

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:12.200
extra prompting to get the AI to observe
these accessibility best practices,

00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:14.989
and even then, that didn't seem
to really be a guarantee

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.890
that you would get the desired result.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.549
Can you share any thoughts or opinions
on how far away we are from everyday users

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:27.289
who maybe aren't accessibility specialists
being able to generate,

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.689
I'm using air quotes
for the listening audience,

00:45:29.689 --> 00:45:32.989
"reasonably accessible sites"
on their own?

00:45:40.192 --> 00:45:44.102
<v Janaki Konar>: Based on my experience,
while I was trying to build a site,

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.649
so even after giving
a detailed description on making sure

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.172
that the button is accessible
or making sure the color combinations

00:45:52.173 --> 00:45:54.673
are sufficient enough
to meet certain requirements,

00:45:54.709 --> 00:45:58.219
the AI definitely made sure
that it's somewhat there,

00:45:58.219 --> 00:46:01.737
it's somewhat not there,
is what my opinion is.

00:46:01.787 --> 00:46:06.710
I do understand, when it's a new user,
and we are not sure what to make sure

00:46:07.016 --> 00:46:10.259
that how to get
an accessible output out of it,

00:46:10.676 --> 00:46:15.216
yes, AI would not literally give you
those results,

00:46:15.297 --> 00:46:18.246
just by saying that,
make sure the site is accessible.

00:46:18.536 --> 00:46:23.005
We have to give a detailed response
or detailed prompt in that case,

00:46:23.006 --> 00:46:26.741
maybe calling it out, make sure
that the button has descriptive name,

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:32.568
or the color combination
that are being used it will be meeting

00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:35.510
the requirement as for certain standards.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.812
For me, yes, it is not there up till now,
and it requires a detailed prompt.

00:46:44.378 --> 00:46:45.878
<v Chris>: Fahad, anything to add?

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:47.660
Or can I move to the next question?

00:46:47.759 --> 00:46:50.531
<v Fahad Lambate>: Yes, I guess so.
I'll just add one thing.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.310
Because, as I said,

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.640
when it comes to accessibility,
I'll say, yes,

00:46:57.931 --> 00:47:04.332
even when we see developers coding
a website from there in itself,

00:47:04.411 --> 00:47:08.011
and not necessarily using an AI,
I'll also say

00:47:08.012 --> 00:47:10.429
they are not "reasonably accessible"
as well.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.880
Because it all depends
on how knowledgeable you are

00:47:13.999 --> 00:47:17.300
from the accessibility
requirements point of view.

00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:21.710
Because even to give prompts,
you need certain accessibility,

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.250
like the knowledge.

00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:25.040
At least the basic ones,
like the low-hanging fruit,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:32.720
you can try to move out of the way
as I was mentioning in the talk as well.

00:47:33.319 --> 00:47:36.269
Like with regards to color contrast,
that is an easy prompt.

00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:43.129
Just give me some no contrast colors,
which are having an accessible ratios.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.670
That is one of the easiest one.

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:51.455
Some of the things AI is taking care of,
with regards to basic labels and all.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.079
I think so, those would be pretty good.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.100
When it comes to more complex component,

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:00.348
I don't think so that AI
is still there yet,

00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:05.239
because it requires a lot of engineering,
manual engineering from the developers

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.241
and experts.

00:48:07.621 --> 00:48:11.121
<v Chris>: All right, wonderful.
Thank you both so much for those insights.

00:48:11.539 --> 00:48:15.498
In the less than two minutes we have left,
I want to ask a question

00:48:15.499 --> 00:48:17.689
that maybe you'll be able
to answer, which is,

00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:18.689
if you could put

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.749
everyone working
on these AI building tools into one room

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.680
and tell them to change one thing,
and they had to do it,

00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:29.079
what would you tell them?

00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:34.009
<v Fahad>: Go ahead, Janaki.

00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:38.149
<v Janaki>: The only thing would be
the AI should make sure

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.760
the code is correct.

00:48:40.989 --> 00:48:46.859
For example, if AI is creating a button,
it should make sure that it has a role,

00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:48.639
it receives focus,

00:48:48.839 --> 00:48:52.029
it has a need,
it has a good color combination.

00:48:52.269 --> 00:48:55.769
Making sure whatever element
it is creating,

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:58.662
it has basic accessibility
that it should meet.

00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:00.623
Yes, Fahad.

00:49:00.943 --> 00:49:06.800
<v Fahad>: I know this
might be thinking out loud.

00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:10.879
When it comes
to just one thing, I would say,

00:49:11.269 --> 00:49:13.820
when we are trying to give
the prompts, maybe,

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.640
like nonsense,
this is all AI build,

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:20.400
and there would be definitely
machine learning involved behind this.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:25.098
If those prompts
can yield maybe quick accessibility tips

00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:26.099
as well

00:49:26.269 --> 00:49:28.419
when you're trying
to build a button, maybe,

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:31.030
so maybe AI can just tell, okay,

00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:35.179
ensure the button is having a label,
maybe the keyboard support,

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.909
or if you're trying to add an image, maybe

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:45.260
the AI can just give a prompt that okay,
ensure that you check the image is having

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.020
accurate alternate text or not.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.690
Maybe some kind of that intuitive--

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.100
<v Chris>: I'm sorry, I have
to cut you off there,

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.300
because we have to give
our captioners a break.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.940
