<v MADLIN NTI> Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.790
My name is Madlin Nti.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.051
I'm the acting secretary
with Google Developer Groups,

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.101
Accra.

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.251
Thank you for joining us
for Continuous AI for Accessibility:

00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:49.294
Leveraging Tools for Faster,

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:52.842
More Inclusive Development
with Helen Hou-Sandí.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.320
Helen is
the Staff Software Engineering Manager

00:01:56.381 --> 00:02:01.301
for Accessibility Engineering at GitHub
and one of five Lead Developers

00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:03.941
on the WordPress
open source software project.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.740
As a technologist,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.450
she has built a career as a leader
in open-source software and management,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.120
and cares deeply
about building and sharing

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:15.730
great and accessible user experiences.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.390
Having been a professional musician
in a previous life,

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:23.110
Helen believes in the value
of the intersection of technique

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:27.011
and artistry in all aspects of life,
including software.

00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.391

with other attendees.

00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:40.780
>> HELEN HOU-SANDÍ: Hello, everyone.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.270
My name is Helen Hou-Sandí.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:46.180
I'm here today to talk about something
that's been a lot of my most recent work,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.401
Continuous AI for Accessibility.

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:53.379
The reason for that is that these days I'm
the staff software engineering manager

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.739
for accessibility at GitHub,
though many of you may know me

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.090
as one of the lead developers
of WordPress core.

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:03.161
I'm really excited to bring
those two parts of my life together today.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.230
While yes, of course,
I'm talking about the place I work,

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.308
I genuinely believe
that these are concepts

00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.158
and tools that can be helpful to you.

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.001
What do I mean by Continuous AI
for Accessibility?

00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.501
Our formal definition is:

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.790
Continuous AI for Accessibility
is an ongoing approach

00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.431
to building accessible software
by integrating tools,

00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.000
AI, and best practices
into the development process.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.680
It's a broad concept,

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.030
not a single tool,

00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:34.191
meant to inspire conversation
and continuous improvement.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.651
Now, if you're an AI skeptic
or completely reject it,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.500
that's okay.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.400
There's still content in here for you.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.370
I personally have never been
a fancy new tools type of person.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.179
For instance,
I still maybe infamously prefer not to use

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.530
CSS preprocessors,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.131
but I also believe in adapting
to the present and that leveraging AI

00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.680
to reduce toil in a time
where we're being asked to do more

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.570
with less is a worthy topic.

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.100
The points that I really want to emphasize
today are that this is not a one-off tool.

00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.280
It's a part of your methodology
for continuous improvement,

00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:12.941
that it's about integrating
automation, AI,

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.649
and then, most importantly,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.451
human review into development workflows.

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.190
This is also about encouraging
developer experimentation,

00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:24.791
adoption, and contribution
through open source tools.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.851
Why does Continuous AI
for Accessibility matter?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.760
Why am I here today
talking at you about this topic?

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.220
Why has it been a focal point
for my team for the last few months?

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.120
The short story is
that we believe it will help you,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.040
not just you,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.241
but everybody,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.660
as you make more
of the web more accessible,

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.391
and AI tools themselves as they learn
from things like code review,

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.540
and having a stronger body
of accessible work examples.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.870
First, let's start with our users,
the people that a group of folks

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.381
attending an accessibility event
almost certainly care about the most.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.871
We know that accessibility issues
impact real users with disabilities.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.400
We also know that complex
or inconsistent interfaces cause confusion

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.401
and errors,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.700
and perhaps the thing that I think
about the most which is

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.880
that inclusive design enhances
experience, satisfaction,

00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:22.911
and reach.

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:27.281
We talk about users with disabilities,
but we also talk about the framework of:

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.990
What is a disability?

00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:30.021
Is it permanent?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.811
Is it temporary?
Is it situational?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.860
That's what we mean when we think
about the inclusivity of what we build,

00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.990
and that ability to take

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.599
what we've built, make it more accessible,
not just for one small group of users

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.211
who never changes,
but for everybody at any moment.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.420
We also have to think about our customers,
who are often also our users,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.411
but in the sense that our customers
also have accessibility requirements

00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:00.731
to meet. For us at GitHub,
as a vendor to many entities,

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:02.830
we are held to many regulations.

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:04.431
For many of you,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.930
you are working at places
that maybe we are a vendor to,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.571
and you have to hold us
to those regulations,

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:14.231
or your own customers and clients
have you on board to help them meet

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.310
these requirements.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.900
Some of those challenges that I'm sure

00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:20.890
the majority of you are looking at today

00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:24.250
is that the shortage
of accessibility experts

00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:25.600
makes scaling difficult.

00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:29.411
There are so many compliance pressures
and legal risk.

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.739
The one that I think
many of us are really,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.799
really thinking about right now,
especially in the US,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.207
is getting to WCAG 2.1 AA,
I believe, by April of 2026.

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:44.331
This is Title II enforcement coming

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.030
for larger entities, and then, in 2027,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.220
for the rest.

00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:51.459
There are also just rising
public expectations

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.760
for digital accessibility.

00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:56.101
This applies to everything digital,
realistically.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.971
Our users have

00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:01.031
a different and honestly higher
set of expectations

00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.901
for what the web looks like today,
for what interactivity means,

00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:07.661
and then of course,
what that means for making it accessible,

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:11.289
for making it usable
for generations of users

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.390
who have completely different backgrounds.

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:19.061
Back in May,
on Global Accessibility Awareness Day,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.110
we at GitHub made a pledge
to the open source community.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.450
We wrote that,

00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:26.890
"At GitHub, our mission is
to accelerate human progress

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.580
through developer collaboration.

00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:32.649
We believe people with disabilities
should benefit from and be able

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.020
to contribute
to the creation of that progress."

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.951
You can see
our accessibility mission statement

00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:41.341
and more about our program
at accessibility.github.com.

00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:45.441
This Global Accessibility
Awareness Day pledge

00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:47.410
emphasizes inclusive design,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.410
accessible development,
and community awareness throughout

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.710
the open source community.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.290
That's why we've been doing the work
to open-source a continuous AI

00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.491
for accessibility tool,

00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:00.131
something that is community-driven,
transparent,

00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:01.781
and collaborative to benefit all.

00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:06.171
Now,

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:09.760
I'm an engineering manager
as a part of a large company

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:11.891
with a robust accessibility program.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.070
What exactly is engineering
doing here today?

00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:17.621
Well, we're building solutions.

00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:20.500
In this case, we've taken
that pledge to heart,

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:24.641
and we've built an accessibility scanner
leveraging continuous AI concepts

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.531
to help multiply your efforts.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.261
We call the flow of the tool "find,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.909
file, fix", leveraging already
available tools to find

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.560
issues through scanning pages,

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:39.220
file GitHub issues
with well-crafted content,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.330
representing any issues found,
and being able to fix those issues

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:44.951
using Copilot coding agent.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.310
This is available to you today
as a public beta.

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:51.132
I will share a short link
and a QR code at the end.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.269
We start with the automated
accessibility scanning component,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.270
the find component.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.280
Right now, we use GitHub Actions
along with Axe-core for quick,

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:01.300
reliable checks.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.150
In our experience,
axe violations represent

00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:06.821
a fairly significant number of issues
that are detected

00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:09.970
in other audit methodologies,
and they're easy for users

00:09:09.971 --> 00:09:11.050
to discover as well,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.230
both well-intentioned users
who want you to get better

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.611
and your occasional user
who's operating in bad faith,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.690
looking for problems.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.100
As I mentioned, this is a public beta,
so we are starting

00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.951
with a well-known standard for scanning,
and we do plan to add more over time.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.090
From there,
we get to the file part, which is,

00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:35.351
in our case, leveraging GitHub issues
and writing well-crafted content,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.080
content that's been specifically
tuned for AI to produce

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.130
the best possible results.

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.980
Now, something about that
is that I often talk

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.490
about how this agentic world we live in,

00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:53.460
these AI agents who do the work,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.371
not just your chat interfaces
or code suggestions,

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.751
but you assign it to something,
and it goes and does the work.

00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:04.219
In this world, I think of the agents
as very similar to newer developers.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.291
They're really eager,
they're really motivated,

00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.451
but they have low context.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.320
They tend to go for additive solutions
because they don't know what's going on.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.187
It's really your job as that expert,
as that person with that experience,

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.851
to bring them up with you,

00:10:19.381 --> 
to pass that knowledge to the future.

00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:25.741
That also comes into play
with something like AI.

00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.761
You have to be able to give it the context
that it needs without digging around.

00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:31.711
It doesn't necessarily know where to look.

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.260
It's going to try,
it's going to find things,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.481
but the more that you can point it
to the right place,

00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.181
the better off you're going to be.

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.861
This is how we think
about the content of these issues.

00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:41.911
How could somebody,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:48.091
anybody, a human or a machine,
be able to pick this up and get moving?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.230
That's what we want.

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.790
We want to unlock everybody:

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.791
humans

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.201
like yourself,

00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:57.751
but also newer humans to the space,
all of you leveraging these tools.

00:10:58.721 --> 00:11:02.171
We open these issues with that content
that allows you to get started,

00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:06.301
and then we have AI-powered suggestions,
the fix component.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.599
This is where something like,
in our case, Copilot coding

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.471
agent, will recommend improvements
to developers for review.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.981
Now,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.750
we are not saying you should assign
an issue to Copilot

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.450
and just immediately merge it.

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:24.021
No. The point is that a human
remains in the loop.

00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:25.951
This is the beauty of that Copilot name.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.030
It is there to help you.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.580
It is there to get you started.

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:33.021
If you think about how much faster
it is sometimes for you to review a fix,

00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.521
as opposed to having
to spin up an environment,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.012
write the code yourself,
push it yourself,

00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:39.062
et cetera, et cetera,

00:11:39.143 --> 00:11:44.541
now you can do it through
a pull request-powered workflow.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.800
If you are away from your desk,

00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:50.610
if you that day
are just meetings back to back,

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.781
back to back, back to back,
which is honestly often my life,

00:11:55.221 --> 00:11:59.790
you'll find yourself able to review
more things because you can just stay

00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:02.281
in the web interface,
do some code reviews,

00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:05.191
maybe leave a couple of suggestions
on the web interface,

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.291
I'll show you how that works with Copilot,

00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:09.930
and keep yourself moving,

00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:14.190
multiply your attention, multiply
your efforts through leveraging the tools.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.050
You always remain in the loop.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.501
It's up to you to review the code,
to make sure that it works,

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.151
to do final testing yourselves.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:25.081
You will always require
subject matter experts,

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:26.501
like many of you,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.140
to review and resolve very complex
or nuanced accessibility issues.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.551
The machine is great,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.720
but it's never going to replace us.

00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:37.560
Through this process,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.501
we leverage this concept
of continuous feedback.

00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:42.840
We have early detection.

00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:44.370
We have ongoing improvement.

00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:45.881
We have reviews.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.411
This allows developers to shift left,
as I was talking about,

00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:52.982
to take those efforts
and move them more into the conceptual,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.069
and for your subject matter experts
to amplify their impact

00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.541
through being freed up from the tedium

00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:01.889
and able to focus their expertise
into the areas

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.890
that you truly need.

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:07.484
The things that we benefit from here are:
This speeds up your testing.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.131
A lot of your routine issues
can be handled automatically

00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:12.131
through automation.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:14.451
That's a thing
that a lot of the modern world

00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:16.307
is based on is,

00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:17.789
how can automation,

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.790
how can the machine,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.980
whether we're talking about industry
or we're talking about computers,

00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:25.110
how can these things free you up?

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.060
How can these handle the routine things,
the repetitive things for you?

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.820
This reduces your compliance risk
through early and continuous checks.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.521
You don't wait for an audit,
which represents an issue

00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:37.291
that's already out there for users,

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:41.701
but instead, you're catching them early,
and you're able to address them earlier.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.950
Again, like I was saying,
it frees up your experts

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.200
for the hardest
and most meaningful problems.

00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:49.381
I think something
I'm seeing a lot of right now

00:13:49.611 --> 00:13:53.430
is accessibility beyond web pages.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.049
Many of us are concerned
with the accessibility of our PDFs,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.350
our videos,
of other content that is also available

00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:04.980
through our web interfaces,
and some of these need humans

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:06.180
to take care of them.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.621
They need that human effort.

00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:11.281
We can't suddenly create more humans.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.571
We can't suddenly hire.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.630
Let's be real.

00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:15.281
Now is not the time for that.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.759
How can we leverage these tools?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.860
Because we still have
to get the work done.

00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:24.330
We have to focus
on what we're able to control.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.270
Right now, that's leveraging
these sorts of tools in order to make

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.520
ourselves more effective.

00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:33.421
Now, I'm going to switch
over to doing a demo.

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.441
You may notice a small cut

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:38.677
as I get reset with what I'm sharing,

00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:40.980
so that I can actually show you
what I'm talking about.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.170
I'm not just here to talk about concepts.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.321
I'm here to show you what
is actually available to you today,

00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:49.021
because I really want you
to get started with using it.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.161
Fair warning, I use light mode.

00:14:56.881 --> 00:14:59.820
We've just switched
from pretty dark slides

00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:02.580
over to a light mode interface for GitHub.

00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:04.919
This is my own accessibility.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.241
I use reduced motion.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.439
I also tend to keep things where I need
to read at length in light mode.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.800
I have difficulty reading
at length in dark mode.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.150
I apologize for the color shift,

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.926
but that's what we're going with,
so I can actually see

00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:21.276
what I'm presenting to you.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.358
What I've got in front of me
it actually currently says private,

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.158
because I'm pre-recording this talk,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.469
but in about 24 hours
from when I'm recording this,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.511
this should be public,
and then you'll be able

00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:35.851
to see it by the time
you're seeing this talk.

00:15:35.944 --> 00:15:38.489
This is what we've open-sourced for you.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:46.065
It is at
github.com/github/accessibility-scanner.

00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:48.265
At GitHub,

00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:50.820
we are dealing with repositories all day,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.810
so we talk
about github/accessibility-scanner.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.521
Again, I'll give you a short URL
after I give this demo.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.061
What we find in here are
an Action, a GitHub Action.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.040
This, hopefully, is a familiar concept
to many of you at this point.

00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:15.090
If it's not, what GitHub Actions are,
they leverage the infrastructure

00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:17.991
and the things that we have
available to you through GitHub

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:21.690
to run automations for you,
to run them on our machines

00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:22.691
in the cloud,

00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:26.671
so that you have a consistent environment,
so you're not having to do it locally.

00:16:26.671 --> 00:16:28.081
It allows you to schedule things.

00:16:28.081 --> 00:16:30.699
It allows you to run things on demand.

00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:32.761
That way, again, it frees you up.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.141
It's running in the background.

00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:36.360
It's not taking up your time,
your resources.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.571
You just let it run,
and it does things for you.

00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:42.660
That's what GitHub Actions
very, very briefly is.

00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:45.221
That's what we're leveraging here today.

00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:49.020
Again, I know it's a tricky topic
because I work at GitHub,

00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:54.000
and with it being
such a common and popular tool,

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.431
it's unavoidable that we talk about it.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.411
I'm not here to talk at you about it
in my capacity as a GitHub person,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.660
but rather, these are the tools
that we have in front of us.

00:17:05.161 --> 00:17:06.161
Previously,

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:12.001
I'd worked on the plugin deploy
actions through 10up when I was there.

00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:15.031
Again, that was leveraging Actions
just because we know

00:17:15.031 --> 00:17:16.781
this is where developers are today.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.060
It's not about evangelizing
for one specific tool,

00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:23.261
but rather meeting you
where you already are.

00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:25.661
This is what's available to you.

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:29.641
You'll be able to see there's
plenty of documentation,

00:17:30.271 --> 00:17:32.371
we're writing more documentation as we go,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.660
how to get this set up
for yourself over time,

00:17:37.771 --> 00:17:40.410
licensing, all the support documents,
and everything.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.471
I'm going to show you
how this actually works.

00:17:43.471 --> 00:17:45.780
It's not just
about showing you the repository.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.260
Here's a repository

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.051
that represents a website.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.061
I've actually deployed it to GitHub Pages.

00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:55.320
I guess you could look at it.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.171
It's from a library called ️AstroWind.

00:17:58.261 --> 00:17:59.610
It's not in WordPress. I'm so sorry.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.070
It's because I wanted
to publish it to Pages.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.171
On this site, this is just their setup.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.260
I have not changed anything
about it besides configuration

00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.471
to make it work, and that's represented
in this repository.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.994
What happens is,
for me, in the same repository--

00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:21.782
Again, the concept with Actions
is that you could actually technically run

00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:24.271
the scanner
from a completely different repository

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.330
so that you're not exposing
that run to others.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.920
In this case, I don't mind.

00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.944
I don't mind you all knowing
that I'm running this scanner.

00:18:32.184 --> 00:18:34.920
What I've got is a GitHub workflow file.

00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:38.475
I've named it accessibility-scan.yml.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.310
It doesn't matter.
You can name it whatever you like.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.310
Of course,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.481
you'd probably want to name it something
that you're going to remember

00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:46.561
and recognize.

00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:50.311
This goes
into a toplevel .github directory,

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.411
and then a workflows subdirectory

00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:55.261
in that toplevel .github directory.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.260
This is a standard
that allows GitHub to know

00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.261
where all of your Actions workflows live

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.740
so that it's able to detect them
and make them available to you.

00:19:04.493 --> 00:19:06.750
What we do is we give it a name.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.310
Again, this
is whatever you want to call it.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.210
I've called it Accessibility Scanner
for my own legibility.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.410
There's an on directive,

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.191
I'll explain this in a moment,
and then the jobs.

00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:19.251
The job is the accessibility scanner.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.885
It uses the scanner
repo github/accessibility-scanner@v2.

00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:27.635
You always want to define
a version that you're working against

00:19:27.636 --> 00:19:30.031
because if there are
breaking changes—

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.141
this isn't WordPress,

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.540
it's not backwards compatible forever—

00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:35.581
with breaking changes,
you want to make sure

00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.820
that you're not surprised by that
by not pinning yourself

00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:40.050
to a specific version.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.250
From here, you provide it a set of URLs.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:50.220
We are working on the ability to feed
in a sitemap as well as exploring

00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:52.371
the idea of what it means
to have a crawler.

00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:55.410
Of course, this is going
to be imperfect, so preferably,

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.881
you are able to provide it
with a comprehensive list of URLs.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.160
You tell it what repository
to open issues in,

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.470
which can be a repository different
from the one you're running it out of,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.470
like I said.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.140
Let's say you have a public site,

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.569
and maybe you're running the scanner
from the public repo,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.581
but you actually want to open the issues
in a private repo for your own tracking.

00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:21.000
For us at GitHub, we actually open
all of the scanning issues

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.861
in one central repository,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.564
and they're connected to tracking issues
for different feature teams at GitHub.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.031
You also have to give it a token.

00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:33.300
That's what gives it the ability
to actually write the issues

00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:35.901
and that sort of thing,
and then there's a cache key.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.122
The reason for the cache key--

00:20:37.122 --> 00:20:39.271
and this can be whatever you want to call it.

00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:42.780
I named it for the name of my repo.

00:20:43.071 --> 00:20:45.565
The reason you need this is
so that it doesn't always implement

00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:46.565
duplicates for you.

00:20:46.685 --> 00:20:49.335
On each run, it needs to know
what happened previously

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.781
so it doesn't duplicate
already known violations.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.881
Now, going back to on,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.088
which I said I would go back to,
right now it says on: workflow_dispatch.

00:21:00.271 --> 00:21:03.249
This is our directive basically
for running it on demand

00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:04.755
in the Actions UI.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.150
You'll be able to navigate to the Action,

00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:11.071
there will be a dropdown for run workflow,
where you set a couple of options,

00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.221
and then you can run
the workflow on demand.

00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:18.149
This is a really great way to get started,
because you want to be in control.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.100
You want to see
what those initial results are.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.039
Once you get past that point,
what you're probably going

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.040
to want to do is set this to on: schedule.

00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:27.780
Then, in that schedule,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.230
you use cron job notation
to define a time,

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:34.411
a recurring schedule
for running this Action.

00:21:35.301 --> 00:21:36.480
Again, at GitHub,

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:40.920
we are using many components
of this already today

00:21:40.921 --> 00:21:41.921
internally,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.476
and we run this once daily
on production URLs.

00:21:45.931 --> 00:21:47.101
That's what you can do as well.

00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:50.070
It's not just on-demand,
run the scanner, which,

00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:52.681
again, for early stages,
is often something you want to do.

00:21:52.681 --> 00:21:54.570
You want to be in control
of that and monitoring

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.570
the results,

00:21:55.801 --> 00:21:59.250
but once you're in a more stable place,
you can switch it to a schedule,

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.350
run it once per day, once per hour.

00:22:01.561 --> 00:22:06.420
I will say it's probably not the most fun
to run it every single time you push

00:22:06.421 --> 00:22:11.250
because it's running on a bunch of URLs,
but you can set it up that way.

00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:14.879
You can set it up to run
on any number of events available to you

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.880
at GitHub.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.760
So, I've run this workflow.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.864
I'm not going to do this live
because it takes a few minutes

00:22:22.865 --> 00:22:23.706
to do this scan,

00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:28.225
and then it takes probably a solid
10 to 20 minutes per pull request,

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:29.629
either running in parallel,

00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:31.471
that Copilot opens.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.330
Oh, and one thing to call out is actually

00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:36.771
in this Action,

00:22:36.771 --> 00:22:39.181
you can also explicitly
tell it not to assign

00:22:39.182 --> 00:22:44.430
Copilot to issues in case you just want
to log the issues and you're not yet ready

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.331
to have Copilot kick off
a bunch of pull requests.

00:22:50.331 --> 00:22:54.521
My run of this scan on two URLs,
I just ran it on two URLs,

00:22:54.714 --> 00:22:56.700
brought me four issues.

00:22:57.931 --> 00:23:01.411
They're pretty typical problems
that we see,

00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:04.710
color contrast ratios and landmarks.

00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:07.920
I will say I do think
that this AstroWind template

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.210
seems pretty great.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.680
Overall, I see many more problems
on any number of other libraries

00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:15.181
by default,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.790
but this is what I'm getting.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.790
To be honest,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.611
what we really see is
just two thematic pieces.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.290
It's the same thing,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.130
two items repeated
on those two URLs that I scanned.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.060
In any case,

00:23:28.201 --> 00:23:31.951
the fixes for them may be different,
so we have to flag each individual one.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.761
We're also exploring the concept of,
"Could Copilot help group these

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.451
in a way that makes them addressable
as one unit?"

00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:44.070
What you can see is
that we have these issues.

00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:46.471
If I click into one,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
like this one,

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.470
we see that it's actually assigned it
to Copilot.

00:23:52.621 --> 00:23:53.791
I've got some labels.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.900
Again, we've got to think,
about we've got to add

00:23:57.901 --> 00:23:59.970
configurability of these labels for you

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.780
so that we're not just making decisions
on your behalf,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.881
but making it a little more configurable.

00:24:05.881 --> 00:24:08.331
These are some defaults
that we've defined for now

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.320
so that you're able to sort things,

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.530
get to know them better, and manage them.

00:24:15.301 --> 00:24:16.800
When it assigns Copilot,

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.441
what Copilot does as an assignee
is it's going to kick off a pull request

00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:24.001
and a working session

00:24:24.511 --> 00:24:26.211
to push code to that pull request.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.931
First, let me show you.

00:24:29.281 --> 00:24:33.449
A big component of our work
has been what content exactly goes

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.800
into the issue description,

00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:38.640
because when you assign
somebody, anybody, Copilot,

00:24:38.971 --> 00:24:40.020
a new developer,

00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:43.969
yourself, what happens when you visit
this issue and you're trying to figure out

00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:44.969
what you need to do?

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:45.970
What's the problem?

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.021
Here we've got the what.

00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:51.781
An accessibility scan flagged an element.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.810
It gives, I'm not going
to read that out loud,

00:24:55.261 --> 00:24:57.841
but the element
that's a paragraph that has

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.201
a large number of classes on it.

00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:04.041
That's the reality
of CSS today, I suppose.

00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:10.786
It says data animated true, et cetera,
on the URL helen.github.io/test-website

00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.520
because elements must meet
minimum color contrast ratio thresholds.

00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:20.579
Learn more about why this was flagged
by visiting dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe,

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.703
the specific rule from Deque University.

00:25:22.703 --> 00:25:26.071
Again, this is because Deque
is behind axe and axe-core,

00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:29.160
so it makes sense
to reference their materials.

00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:31.181
To fix this,

00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:34.200
ensure the contrast between foreground
and background colors

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.591
meets WCAG 2 AA minimum
contrast ratio thresholds.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.730
Specifically, fix any
of the following: Element has

00:25:41.731 --> 00:25:44.461
insufficient color contrast of 1.83

00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:49.181
{foreground color: #bfbfbf,
background color: #fff,

00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:53.370
font size: 15.0 points / 20 pixels,
font weight: normal.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.070
Expected contrast ratio of 4.5:1.}

00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:01.050
Then it actually gives me
a checklist of acceptance criteria

00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:04.710
that says, "The specific axe violation
reported in this issue

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.120
is no longer reproducible.

00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:11.520
The fix must meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines
or the accessibility standards specified

00:26:11.521 --> 00:26:13.661
by the repository or organization."

00:26:13.921 --> 00:26:15.931
I'll also mention some more about that.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.830
"A test should be added
to ensure the specific axe violation

00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:20.833
does not regress.

00:26:21.151 --> 00:26:24.749
This PR must not introduce
any new accessibility issues

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.750
or regressions."

00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:29.101
What Copilot
does is it gives you a little reaction

00:26:29.101 --> 00:26:31.251
with eyes to let you know
that it's seen it,

00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.691
and then it's going to open

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.730
a pull request for you.

00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:38.460
Let's find that one.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.600
That's this pull request
that Copilot has opened.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.149
Copilot writes nice,
long issue descriptions,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.100
but what's really interesting in here

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.480
is that because this uses
Playwright underneath

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.831
a pretty standard testing library,
headless browsing,

00:26:56.101 --> 00:27:01.619
it's actually able to take
screenshots for you and post them

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.620
to the issue,

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.491
which has been a really fascinating thing.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.400
Something my team
has worked on is ensuring

00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:12.571
that we're at least testing to make
sure that it's including alt text

00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:14.231
with these screenshots.

00:27:14.327 --> 00:27:17.790
That's something
that Copilot's also able to do,

00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:22.411
is show you
what it looks like with the change

00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:23.931
if you're visually based.

00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:28.319
It gives you a problem description
as it understands it.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.279
Again, this helps you as the human
in the loop contextualize

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.380
what it decided to do.

00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:35.521
It explains its solution to you.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.781
It explains the impact.

00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:41.430
What's really interesting here
is that Copilot was able to say,

00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:44.280
"This fix improves accessibility
for all elements using

00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:48.090
the text-muted class throughout
the site, 30 plus usages, including:

00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:51.089
hero component subtitles,
feature descriptions,

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.990
blog post excerpts,
testimonial text, et cetera."

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.851
It's really interesting.

00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:58.710
It's able to take a look
through the framework

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.670
and make not just filename-based decisions

00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:06.570
about what's going on, but it's able
to interpret what's happening there.

00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:09.433
It describes its testing to you.

00:28:09.434 --> 00:28:11.520
It says, "The build was successful.

00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:13.980
ESLint checks passed,
prettier formatting passed."

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.709
This is a part of why it takes not
a small amount of time for Copilot

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.791
to finish these PRs.

00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:27.091
I believe this one took probably
about 15 minutes to complete.

00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:30.151
That's because it's actually running
build and test

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.700
within the container for you.

00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:35.671
If you think about yourself
as a developer,

00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:39.390
how long does it take for you to get
your development environment up and going,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.560
make sure that it's not broken?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.030
I'm famous

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.600
for breaking my development environment.

00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:47.311
Making sure that you find the code.

00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.739
Running the tests locally as opposed
to pushing it out to a pull request

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.210
and seeing how the checks go.

00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:56.051
I know we're all guilty of that.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.980
If you think about it,

00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:01.921
the ability for the machine to get
that done in about 10 to 15 minutes

00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:04.861
is so much faster
than we're able to do as humans.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.190
Even at our peak,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.230
ideal environment, everything set up,
it just takes so long.

00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:13.619
We're not multi-threaded
in that same sense.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.520
It's really hard for us
to hop focus between pull requests.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.360
Rather, we're going to sit there,

00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:23.370
if you've seen that xkcd comic
that says, "Oh,

00:29:23.441 --> 00:29:24.510
my code's compiling.

00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:27.064
That's why I'm playing around
in the office right now."

00:29:27.064 --> 00:29:29.164
That's a little more how we are as humans.

00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:31.710
That's why delegating
these tasks to the machine,

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.910
to at least get started,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.560
can really help us.

00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:36.750
If I go take a look

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.910
at the code that it's made,

00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:42.600
I go to the files changed tab,
it shows me it's made just two

00:29:42.601 --> 00:29:43.680
targeted changes

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.730
to these color text-muted...

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.180
they're not variables,

00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:50.431
whatever they're called.

00:29:50.941 --> 00:29:54.241
It's made changes to these
so that they actually meet requirements,

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.191
and it's a very targeted change.

00:29:56.881 --> 00:30:01.020
This is something
that has been improving over time.

00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:04.830
I've seen this improve by huge amounts
over the last couple of months

00:30:05.161 --> 00:30:08.329
in Copilot itself,
which is that in the past,

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.140
it would have a habit of doing things
in what I would call an additive way.

00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:15.071
Again, this is very similar
to a new developer.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.601
They're not always going
to take a look at,

00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:18.601
"What is the system?

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.910
How do I find the fix within the system?"

00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:24.890
They're going to go, "Okay, you told me
to fix the subtitle over here.

00:30:25.371 --> 00:30:27.771
Now I'm going to add
a new class to the subtitle,

00:30:27.861 --> 00:30:32.240
or I'm going to use
that as a selector in my CSS,

00:30:32.241 --> 00:30:34.891
and I'm going to add an override
to change the color."

00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:38.120
Instead, here, Copilot,
the same way we would want

00:30:38.121 --> 00:30:39.201
to see a human do,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.941
is able to take a look through the system
and find that system-level fix

00:30:43.971 --> 00:30:44.971
and apply it.

00:30:45.861 --> 00:30:47.030
Then we can take a look.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.470
We can say,
"Well, I don't like that color,"

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.470
or whatever.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.600
To show you what I mean by that,
what does it mean to give feedback

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600
to the machine?

00:30:54.741 --> 00:30:55.760
How am I going to deal with this?

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.999
What if I hated this pull request
and I didn't want to merge it right now?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.980
Well,

00:31:00.981 --> 00:31:03.140
I've got this other color contrast issue.

00:31:03.351 --> 00:31:04.619
This was the one from the about page.

00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:08.181
It says, "Improve tagline readability
in dark mode."

00:31:08.481 --> 00:31:12.861
This one does not have the same root cause
as the other color contrast issue.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.660
Even though I said
at the beginning that we had

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:18.841
two of the same issue,
this is why they're separate issues.

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:22.011
This is why they open as separate issues,
because they're not actually

00:31:22.011 --> 00:31:23.120
the same root cause.

00:31:24.134 --> 00:31:25.224
Copilot's gone through--

00:31:25.224 --> 00:31:28.075
Again, it's gone through,
and it's identified the problem.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.480
What's the violation?

00:31:29.481 --> 00:31:33.200
There's a foreground color
of a blue-200 variant

00:31:33.411 --> 00:31:36.161
from the color variables
and a background color of white.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:43.272
That color contrast ratio is 2.14,
which is not even close to 4.5.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.950
Then it tells me what its solution is.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.271
It's since edited it.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.100
I'll show you why.

00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:57.380
Initially, it had chosen a blue-50
and had updated the screenshot.

00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:00.355
When I looked at the screenshot,
I said, "Wow, that subtitle

00:32:00.355 --> 00:32:05.211
is really standing out so much more
than I wanted to," especially because,

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.800
actually, there's both a light mode
and a dark mode screenshot.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.410
The tool was smart enough to realize
that there's both

00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:15.080
and provide screenshots of both.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.931
When I compared the two, for me, visually,

00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:21.920
the light screenshot made it clear
that the subtitle was subtext,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.371
but with the dark mode, despite
the font size difference,

00:32:25.842 --> 00:32:28.100
the brightness of the text
was overwhelming.

00:32:28.221 --> 00:32:31.489
It made that information
a little too important on the page

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.490
for what it was.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.970
It made the fix.

00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:38.929
I can @mention Copilot.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.045
That's what's really cool.

00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:43.551
I said, "@copilot is there another color
in between those values

00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:44.801
that can be used instead?

00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:48.440
This makes the tagline text stand out
a bit too much and makes the information

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.990
hierarchy a little less clear."

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.490
Seven minutes later,

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.786
Copilot comes back to me and it says,
"Changed to dark: text-blue-100,

00:32:56.861 --> 00:33:00.049
which provides
better visual hierarchy while maintaining

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.430
excellent accessibility
{16.38:1 contrast ratio}.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.201
This is less prominent than blue-50,
but still far exceeds WCAG requirements."

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.280
It actually attaches,

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.900
again, the dark mode screenshots for me.

00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:17.570
This is really cool as well.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.890
There's not just now you have
to go edit what the AI created,

00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:22.891
which,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.051
I'll be honest, sometimes I do.

00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:25.051
I find that faster.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.079
In a case like this where maybe I've had
to hop in to remediate a site

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.181
that I know very little about,
that I know very little

00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:34.611
about the framework,
I don't really know what's going on,

00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.161
I don't know what values
a previous developer chose,

00:33:37.429 --> 00:33:40.340
Copilot is able to help me navigate that,
make decisions,

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.340
interpret them,

00:33:41.391 --> 00:33:45.620
and I'm able to give it human
phrased feedback,

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:50.000
saying, "Hey, man,
is there some other color

00:33:50.001 --> 00:33:51.551
that you might be able to use?"

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.050
It's able to make
that investigation for me

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.468
without me having to get in there,
research, et cetera,

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.020
which I think
would have taken me longer

00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:02.751
than seven minutes
in an unfamiliar code base.

00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:06.200
I hope that you can see
the promise of this,

00:34:06.201 --> 00:34:07.951
of this accessibility scanner tool.

00:34:08.601 --> 00:34:11.451
Like I said, the assigning it
to Copilot part is optional.

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:14.270
You can imagine if you have
some large site,

00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:16.760
you're providing many, many URLs,
and suddenly you've got

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.141
hundreds of violations,

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.549
you don't want to suddenly kick off
Copilot on hundreds of issues,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.000
opening hundreds of pull requests
that you're not ready to review yet.

00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:27.476
That's optional,

00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:30.530
but I hope that you can see
this power of leveraging tools

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.130
that you're probably already in.

00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:36.080
Even if you cut out the Copilot part,
running the scans,

00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:37.190
this is using Playwright,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.700
this is using axe-core,
this is not using AI at all,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.410
this is leveraging GitHub Actions

00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.661
to open those issues for you.

00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:49.969
Then, when we open those issues
for each of those violations

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.410
with clear information--

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.021
Again, this could be for a human.

00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:56.362
This could be
for a newer developer you have

00:34:56.362 --> 00:34:58.112
on staff who's getting up to speed.

00:34:58.121 --> 00:35:00.860
This could be for somebody
who's been on staff for a while

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.260
and hasn't yet touched accessibility
and wants to learn and is eager.

00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.121
We want to be able to provide

00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:09.051
the tools you need
for whoever it is who's going to fix

00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:10.051
the issues,

00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:11.510
but then, optionally,

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.619
and this is a continuous AI component,
be able to leverage things

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.731
like the coding agent to suggest
fixes for you to get you going faster.

00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:22.491
I'm going to switch
back to my presentation now.

00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:25.141
Again, this is going
to switch back into a darker mode

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.081
and finish out this presentation.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.931
I hope you enjoyed that demo,

00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:32.840
that it gave you some ideas,

00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:36.980
some things to think about,
and that you maybe are willing

00:35:36.981 --> 00:35:39.561
to give it a shot on one of your projects.

00:35:43.221 --> 00:35:44.751
Again, I keep hammering this.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.670
I know it's a fear,
and it's a completely reasonable one.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.499
This really and truly, it's not
about replacing you as a person,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.880
as an expert. It's about unlocking
your energy by reducing that toil

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.020
and giving you a higher starting point
for better leverage.

00:35:59.301 --> 00:36:01.310
I think that,

00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:05.660
again, we're thinking about agents,
from that Copilot,

00:36:05.661 --> 00:36:07.701
the AI side, this agentic world.

00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:12.741
What does that mean for these developers
who you want to bring up with you?

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.291
What does it mean to build experience

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.961
for the next generation of developers?

00:36:18.411 --> 00:36:21.961
If you practice getting better at that,
it actually is a virtuous cycle.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.630
You're also able to influence
the AI in a better way.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.740
We're able to think
about our problems in a clearer sense.

00:36:28.581 --> 00:36:32.390
We talk about what it means
for mastery to be able to teach it.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.440
To be able to describe
something clearly is its own skill set

00:36:36.441 --> 00:36:39.771
and one that I think becomes
all the more important,

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.870
even if AI wasn't in the mix.

00:36:42.141 --> 00:36:45.391
It is really important for us
to be better and better all the time

00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:48.080
at how we describe things
to the people around us.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:52.881
In a lot of ways, the machine
is reflecting our imperfections back at us

00:36:53.151 --> 00:36:55.301
in a way that is
a little bit uncomfortable.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.531
I think it's important
to be able to reflect on that,

00:36:57.531 --> 00:36:59.081
even if the tool isn't for you.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.520
This is a WordPress event.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.860
Another member of our working
team, Carie Fisher,

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.700
she comes from the Drupal world.

00:37:09.111 --> 00:37:12.501
Carie and I have actually spoken together
at a WordCamp before,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.780
years and years
before either of us ever worked

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.780
at GitHub together.

00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:19.395
We are definitely thinking
about next steps to make this tooling

00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:24.260
even more effective for CMSs specifically,
especially the extensible kind.

00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:28.431
What does it mean when issues
are coming from authored content

00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:30.741
or they're third-party, like a plugin?

00:37:31.191 --> 00:37:33.830
These are really great questions
without perfect answers,

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.470
but we do have some recommendations now,
and we're going to continue

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.620
to tune them over time.

00:37:38.607 --> 00:37:39.921
For instance, while yes,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.450
you also want to monitor the end result,
with authored content

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.501
and all of those problems involved,
the AI-powered fixing components,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.330
the scanning component

00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:56.030
with the auto-fix suggestions

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
should probably be constrained
to a test site with example content

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.700
that you know is not the source of issues.

00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:03.681
With plugins,

00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:06.470
this remains tricky,
and it is tricky today,

00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:09.501
because it's code you're not necessarily
in control of.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.510
Once again, it's like teaching
a new developer not to hack core.

00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:19.250
You have to give it explicit instructions,
not to touch files in certain areas;

00:38:20.301 --> 00:38:22.701
instead, "Hey, maybe you want
to look for a hook

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.880
or a different method of overriding
within the code you do control

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.901
to fix any issues."

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.830
How do you give that

00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:31.341
kind of instruction to your developers?

00:38:31.431 --> 00:38:33.321
They have onboarding documents.

00:38:33.461 --> 00:38:36.512
You might have handbooks.
You might have any number of things.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.200
For a tool like Copilot,
this actually comes

00:38:39.201 --> 00:38:41.210
in the form of custom instructions.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.128
This is where you can add to the prompt,

00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:47.541
telling the AI what to do.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.680
I mentioned this previously,
you might tell,

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.371
"how do you customize what the AI
knows about your code base?"

00:38:57.441 --> 00:39:01.281
If we keep going back to this parallel
of it's like a newer developer,

00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:04.111
"how do you onboard newer developers
into your code base,

00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:06.049
especially when it's a large one?"

00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:07.851
If I think about WordPress core,

00:39:08.211 --> 00:39:09.831
getting people up to speed
on WordPress core,

00:39:09.831 --> 00:39:10.831
it's so much work.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:16.070
We really have to challenge ourselves
as the human experts to think about,

00:39:16.071 --> 00:39:18.200
"How are we documenting what we've done?"

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.100
Maybe right now, AI is
a part of our motivation,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.720
but it should be for everybody.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.070
Anybody who ever comes in,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.110
joins us, wants to take part,

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.950
needs to be able to access
that information in a known place.

00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:34.340
For Copilot,
that is custom-instructions.md.

00:39:34.368 --> 00:39:35.690
It's a Markdown file.

00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:37.711
You can give it instructions.

00:39:37.971 --> 00:39:41.451
Let's say that your
WordPress repository layout

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.190
includes all of WP content.

00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:45.261
This has become pretty common.

00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:46.981
You can say,

00:39:47.331 --> 00:39:50.361
"Never touch anything in plugins.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.861
You can only modify files
within this theme's directory.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:59.449
If you are unable to make a fix
without modifying something

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:00.750
outside of that directory,

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.710
please write that down, make it clear."

00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:06.320
Then, for us, again,

00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:09.321
as the humans in the loop,
we're then able to interpret that.

00:40:09.321 --> 00:40:12.379
We're able to look at it and go,
"Okay, I see the type of fix

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.599
it's made in my theme,
but now I understand

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.500
this actually is related to a plugin."

00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:20.541
What if you can't make
that fix in the plugin?

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:24.760
Maybe you keep that override,
but also, maybe you go

00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:26.861
back to that project
and you contribute it back.

00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:28.510
That's the beauty
of the open source world.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.920
It's not about labor.

00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:32.821
I think the labor framing
is really dangerous for open source.

00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:33.822
It's not about labor.

00:40:33.822 --> 00:40:36.401
It's about caring for a thing
that's for all of us.

00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:39.850
I think in the accessibility space,
that's all the more important.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.830
We do have

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.841
our values, our morals,

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.504
but sometimes we really have
to come back to,

00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:49.451
"What can I do to benefit everybody?

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.050
What is it that is caring
for the greater good?"

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.669
If you're able to contribute
back to a plugin that needs a fix,

00:40:57.719 --> 00:40:58.719
that's great.

00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.899
If, in the end, the practical outcome
is that you need

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.531
to override it in order to deliver
that fix to your actual users,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.810
I think that's also okay.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.461
That's why we're the people in the loop.

00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:12.610
It's up to us to make
those value judgments and what we're going

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.610
to do with it.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.141
This is a really exciting space
to me, one that I'm really excited

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:20.351
to explore next, which is:
What do you do

00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:23.710
in the world of CMSs
that have lots of extensions?

00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:29.531
Like I said, we have this repository.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.290
By the time you're watching this talk,
it should be public to you.

00:41:33.371 --> 00:41:35.801
There is a QR code up on the screen.

00:41:36.634 --> 00:41:39.701
If you like QR codes, this
is probably more effective

00:41:39.731 --> 00:41:41.920
in a live presentation environment,

00:41:42.571 --> 00:41:49.771
or the short link is gh.io/a11y-scanner.

00:41:50.771 --> 00:41:51.771
Your Ally scanner.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.389
That's how you can get
to the repository really quickly.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.590
Start learning about it.

00:41:57.491 --> 00:41:59.770
Start using it,
because it's a GitHub Action.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.381
I do want to call out a few things.

00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:05.080
This is evolving rapidly.

00:42:05.081 --> 00:42:07.371
It's a public beta.
That's what we're going to call it.

00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:08.620
Updates may be frequent.

00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.601
We are tagging it in a way
where breaking changes

00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:12.101
are going to be a new version.

00:42:12.644 --> 00:42:14.139
Things are subject to change.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.030
Not all of your requests
are going to be implemented.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.980
We have our own needs, our own roadmap.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.140
A lot of customer feedback
and usage data is still being collected.

00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:25.840
I don't mean usage data
as in spying on you.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.559
We have a group of beta testers
who are customers

00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:32.049
who we're in close touch with.

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.249
This is how we're understanding

00:42:33.249 --> 00:42:34.330
how they're using it.

00:42:35.051 --> 00:42:37.664
Axe-core itself is just axe-core.

00:42:38.114 --> 00:42:43.282
Our internal data for our own process
is that it finds about 25%

00:42:43.462 --> 00:42:45.251
of our audit-flagged issues.

00:42:45.812 --> 00:42:47.262
That is a significant number.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.811
It's worth getting ahead of those,
but you do still have to do

00:42:49.811 --> 00:42:50.631
manual testing.

00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:53.101
You still need to be that person
who understands what it means,

00:42:53.101 --> 00:42:58.330
not just to check boxes,
but to actually have a great experience.

00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:01.000
Again, code suggestions,
please be in the loop.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.131
Do not just blindly merge stuff in.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.830
I really want to encourage you
to check out this repo

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:08.680
to really think of it.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.850
Yes, it is open-source.

00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:13.991
We're probably not going to have
the most robust process for it,

00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:15.850
but it is open-source.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.450
It's there for you to check out,

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.649
to look at our code, to dig in,
to contribute,

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.356
to modify it, to fork it,
to do whatever you want with it.

00:43:23.356 --> 00:43:24.731
It really is.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.470
We want to be transparent with you.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.770
We really want to do that.

00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:32.161
Thank you for joining me today.

00:43:32.231 --> 00:43:34.877
I also want to take this moment to thank

00:43:34.897 --> 00:43:37.017
some team members
who've been working incredibly hard

00:43:37.017 --> 00:43:39.489
on this over the last few months,
honestly,

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.490
years,

00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:42.041
from keeping us organized,

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:44.261
to talking to our own customers
who've been using

00:43:44.261 --> 00:43:47.200
this as a private beta,
to testing and adjusting

00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:49.901
the issue content to get
better results from Copilot,

00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:51.789
to writing the Action

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.890
and actually sub-actions
inside themselves,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.540
to testing and leveraging
those Actions internally

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.990
for our own use to enhance axe scanning
that we've actually been doing

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280
for a good while.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.790
I've left it to this very end,
but I think that's the part

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.260
that I'm the most excited about,
which is that we're taking

00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:11.980
this work we've already done at GitHub,
running axe scanning on a schedule,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.540
opening violations,

00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:17.041
leveraging the tools that we have
available to us to scale those fixes.

00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:21.131
We're adapting it in a way
that can be shared with the public.

00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:23.631
We're really taking
the open source ethos to heart,

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:26.980
and the fact that we're building
on open technologies ourselves

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.980
and sharing it back out with all of you.

00:44:29.492 --> 00:44:32.230
Thank you to Carie Fisher,
Kendall Gassner,

00:44:32.231 --> 00:44:35.521
Clay Miller, and Abdul Ahmad
from our GitHub accessibility program

00:44:35.531 --> 00:44:39.031
and engineering for their most recent work
to bring this to the public.

00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:42.001
Also, thank you all again
for joining me today.

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:45.171
We're so excited to have
this opportunity to share with you.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.520
I hope you'll give it a shot
and give us lots of feedback.

00:44:48.676 --> 00:44:50.470
I genuinely want to hear it.

00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:54.470
I'll join you now live for a Q&amp;A,
and I'll catch you online.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.261
<v Madlin> Thank you so much,
Helen, for that presentation.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.810
Do remember that you can put
in your Q&amp;A in the Q&amp;A section.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.243
Let's get right into it.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.160
Helen, this is from
an anonymous attendee,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.639
and they're asking,
"Do you have any recommendations

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.359
for tools and plugins to help
prevent accessibility

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.922
issues made by content editors?

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.383
Is there a way to prevent
inaccessible and/or large PDFs,

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.659
wrong heading levels, etc."

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.553
What do you have to say about that?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.859
<v Helen> I went ahead

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.159
and I answered
these by typing as well,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.859
just because I know
we're short on time.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.959
I actually don't have specific
recommendations

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.059
for you in the WordPress space.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.879
I'm not personally
using any at this time.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.579
I think because we've got
a lot of great attendees

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.469
and speakers,
I think this is a great group

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.802
to poll and see
who's using what out there.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.439
It's definitely something
I need to start looking at,

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.569
because we're actually working
with customers internally at GitHub,

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:07.069
and some of them
have these questions.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.739
Actually, we've been asked
about Drupal already,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.609
not quite yet WordPress.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.079
I think we need to do it as well,

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.649
because we actually use
WordPress for the GitHub blog.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.709
I have seen some really cool
tools out in the open source space.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.939
That makes me really happy.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.859
For instance, Code for America
has a Ruby-backed PDF processor.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.889
I think these are all just
really great things.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.439
Happy to talk
more about it over time.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.749
I've finally joined
the Slack as well.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.651
Happy to take it there.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.649
<v Madlin> Sure thing. Thank you.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.719
Emilio Dominguez is asking,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.199
"What data does GitHub
use to train the models?

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.198
How can we know they are accurately
fixing or addressing issues?"

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.909
<v Helen> GitHub does not actually train

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.309
the models directly
ourselves in that sense.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.659
What we do is we are the home

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.739
where we leverage
other models as they exist.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.628
We do a lot of work
to bring in the latest models,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.639
like the day that they're announced.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.979
We partner up.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.899
We've got like Claude 4.5 as a beta,
the day that they share it.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.119
We're not really training
the models themselves,

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.459
but rather what we're doing
is we're providing the models

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.348
with more context based
on what we know as GitHub.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:25.320
We'll feed
it your repository privately.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.809
It doesn't go into the open space,

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.689
or rather here's the context
of the repository,

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.959
possibly here's the context
of your enterprise.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.229
By definition, AI output
is what we call indeterminate.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.609
It's going to be a little
bit different,

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:41.179
or it can be a little
bit different each time.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.080
What you can do,
a lot of the responsibility lies

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.799
with you as well, leveraging
those things

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.509
like custom instructions,
leveraging tools.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.339
If you haven't looked
at MCP servers yet,

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.571
that's a really cool thing.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.449
We've created an MCP server

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.959
for our own design system
so that we can attach

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.389
that when we're using
Copilot internally,

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:03.829
and that way Copilot knows

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.162
how to use our own
design system correctly.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.609
There are some things
that we are able to do internally

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:15.779
to actually impact, not the model,
but our own implementation,

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.730
how we're using it broadly for users.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.149
For instance, with the agent,

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.849
when I showed
that it posted screenshots,

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.859
and I mentioned that my team
had worked on this,

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.369
that's what an engineer,
Kendall, on my team did.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:32.240
She learned about
how it tests itself.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.961
The AI tests itself using AI.

00:48:34.962 --> 00:48:39.319
It's a little bit Ouroboros
snake eating its own

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.319
tail going on here,
but that's what it does.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.749
It runs and it tests against itself,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.869
and what she did was she explicitly
added a test to make sure

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:52.129
that it's adding meaningful alt
text anytime it posts a screenshot.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.099
Those are the things
that we're able to do internally.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.869
<v Madlin> Thank you so much, Helen,

00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:00.079
for such an insightful presentation.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.549
We're grateful to have you here.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.230
Thank you so much.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.479
<v Helen> Thank you for having me.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.489
I'm sorry we're short on time
for Q&amp;A, but like I said,

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.989
I'm actually in Slack now.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:10.359
I'm happy to answer
more things there,

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.149
and I've answered everything
that I could that I saw in chat.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:15.799
Thank you for letting me share.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.369
Looking forward to any feedback
you all might have.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.639
<v Madlin> Great. Thank you.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.639
