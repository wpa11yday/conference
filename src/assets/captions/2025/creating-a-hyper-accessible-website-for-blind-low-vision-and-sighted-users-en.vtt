>> ALEXANDRA BLANCO: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.504
My name is Alexandra Blanco.

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:37.806
Thank you for joining us

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:42.866
for Creating a Hyper-Accessible Website
for Blind, Low Vision, and Sighted Users

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:45.428
with Sandy Shin and Jeremy Perkins.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.907
Sandy is an accomplished
marketing and communication professional

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:51.889
with over 30 years of experience
at organizations

00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:56.059
including UCLA, USC, IBM, and Disney.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.851
As the Vice President
of Marketing and Communications

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.789
for the Braille Institute of America,

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.471
she led the launch
of Atkinson Hyperlegible Typeface,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.482

that has gained
over 40 million global impressions.

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.746
Jeremy works at the intersection
of design, human behavior, and technology.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:17.503
He has spent 25 years

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.250
designing and building
websites and digital products

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:22.183
that help people achieve their goals

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:25.663
in higher education, nonprofit,
and health care.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:29.974
His specialties include
design systems and web accessibility,

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.003
building
flexible and extensible interfaces

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.443
that are a delight
to use by everyone.

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:39.726
Please feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.260

>> JEREMY PERKINS: Hey, everyone.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.599
Welcome to our talk
for WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:53.616
It's called
Creating a Hyper-Accessible Website

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:56.295
for Blind, Low Vision, and Sighted Users.

00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:58.300
We're excited to talk today

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:00.612
about a case study for a website

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.213
that we worked on
with the Braille Institute

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.872
that serves people

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.381
who have a disability

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.608
and really need
a hyper-accessible website.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.076
It was built
on the WordPress platform,

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.946
and we're going to talk through

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:16.763
the case study
and the discovery process,

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:18.948
and how we personalized
the experience,

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:21.849
and a little
on how it was developed in WordPress.

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:23.356
So, let's dive in.

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:25.992
I'm Jeremy Perkins.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.736
I'm the Director of UX and Design
at iFactory.

00:03:29.112 --> 00:03:30.462
>> SANDY SHIN: I'm Sandy Shin.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:33.332
I'm the Vice President
of Marketing and Communication

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:34.645
at the Braille Institute.

00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:39.062
>> JEREMY: iFactory, quick note,

00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:43.889
we are a full-service agency
that serves higher education primarily.

00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:46.204
We do everything
from strategy and discovery

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.624
to brand, UX, design, content,

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:49.992
SEO,

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:51.565
website development,

00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:54.335
and of course,
a deep focus on web accessibility.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:58.507
>> SANDY: Braille Institute,

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:01.026
just to give you
a little bit of background of who we are,

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:02.028
our mission is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.625
to positively transform the
lives of those with vision loss.

00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:07.822
We serve people of all ages,

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:10.405
children, youth, adults,

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:12.249
and all ranges of vision loss.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.556
So, individuals with no vision
who are completely blind

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:20.947
to individuals with low vision
who have some degree of vision still left.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.750
We serve
about 15,000 people a year.

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.152
We were started--just to give you
a little bit of background--

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.465
we're a nonprofit

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:33.711
who has been around for
more than 105 years.

00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:36.531
We were started by a man,
Bob Atkinson,

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:39.323
who lost his vision as an adult

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.870
due to a gunshot wound
that left him completely blind.

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:44.725
He realized

00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:49.968
there was very little Braille material
available for people who were blind.

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:54.773
He was actually an entrepreneur
and an accessibility advocate

00:04:54.848 --> 00:04:56.949
before those terms
were even coined.

00:04:57.406 --> 00:04:59.619
He started the Universal Braille Press,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.382
which published materials
out of his garage.

00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:08.396
He worked with Congress to establish
a library for the blind and print disabled

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.663
to provide free Braille books.

00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:14.561
We, since then,

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:16.558
have really expanded

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:22.488
and developed a full range of services,
including assistive technology training.

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.811
We have library services,

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.030
low vision consultation
and rehabilitation,

00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:30.001
orientation, and mobility

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:31.902
that allow people to travel

00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:35.643
and move safely
throughout their surroundings.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:38.489
We have
year-round classes and workshops.

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.786
We have locations
in Southern California,

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:46.955
but we also have classes
available to anybody virtually,

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:51.405
and all of our services
are completely free of charge.

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:58.031
One of the other things
we introduced about five years ago

00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:02.710
was a font called Atkinson Hyperlegible,
named after our founder.

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:08.106
It was developed
specifically for people with low vision.

00:06:09.074 --> 00:06:14.185
What makes it unique
is it focuses on letter differentiation.

00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:19.102
We've got a couple of new versions,
a monospaced version.

00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:23.338
We have an enhanced version
called Atkinson Hyperlegible Next.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.854
The fonts are available
to download for free

00:06:26.902 --> 00:06:29.443
on Google Fonts,
as well as our website.

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:33.768
It has really become, in our minds,

00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:38.186
the accessible font
for people to use.

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:39.968
You can see down below,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.885
there's some examples
of some of the characters

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.525
and how they're differentiated
from one another.

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:49.378
A capital O
looks very different from the zero.

00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:53.162
A one and a capital I and a lowercase i
and an l,

00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:56.621
they all look distinctly different,

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:02.656
either because we put a tail or a hat
on the different letters

00:07:02.742 --> 00:07:04.642
to differentiate them
from one another.

00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.019
We, again, encourage anybody
to use our Atkinson Hyperlegible Font.

00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:14.171
So, let's talk a little bit

00:07:14.223 --> 00:07:16.506
about why Braille Institute decided

00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:19.524
to do a complete redesign
of our website

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:22.694
rather than upgrading or enhancing
the old site.

00:07:23.474 --> 00:07:26.273
There were a lot of reasons
to start fresh.

00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:30.420
First of all,
our website was very bloated.

00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:32.918
We had about 700 pages.

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.804
When we looked at the analytics,
we realized

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:40.373
that about 4%
of the pages that people viewed

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.975
made up like 75% of the visits,

00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:45.672
which meant there were a lot
of pages on our website

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.434
that people were not viewing.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.783
Because of the number of pages we had,
it was hard to navigate.

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:53.251
The site was very dense.

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.568
It wasn't
particularly visitor-friendly,

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:58.791
especially for individuals
who were blind or had low vision.

00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:01.122
It wasn't sticky or engaging.

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:04.405
Visitors would come
and bounce off and leave.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.094
We had limited accessibility.
It really wasn't integrated into the site.

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:14.417
The branding was not reflective
of who we were as a brand.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:17.927
There was a lot of copy
that was focused on talking about us

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.862
as opposed to talking about the person
coming to the site seeking help.

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:26.821
We brought on iFactory
to be our partner on this project

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.620
because
of their expertise in accessibility,

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.701
and their focus
on the user experience.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.870
Let's talk a little bit
about the user mindset.

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:40.493
One of the first things we did was

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:42.981
we really wanted to understand
the user

00:08:43.052 --> 00:08:46.434
and really understand
what they were thinking and feeling,

00:08:46.528 --> 00:08:49.995
so we could create a web experience
that met their needs.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:54.314
We talked to two key groups,

00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:56.771
individuals with no vision who were blind,

00:08:57.201 --> 00:08:59.913
as well as individuals
who had low vision.

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:04.236
That group continues
to be a growing segment.

00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:08.801
Just to share
a little bit of a statistic with you,

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:11.882
as it relates
to the low vision population,

00:09:11.913 --> 00:09:15.606
by 2050,
we expect the number to double

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:19.198
in terms of the number of people
who are visually impaired or blind.

00:09:19.723 --> 00:09:21.373
A majority of those people

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:24.550
are going to be people
who have low vision.

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:27.091
We have aging baby boomers.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.767
People are living longer.

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:31.146
There are a number
of progressive eye diseases.

00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:33.502
This is a really important group.

00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:34.779
We want to make sure

00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:38.780
we're meeting
who they are and where they are

00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:40.675
when they come to our website.

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:49.620
Again, we focused on the experience
of people coming to Braille Institute

00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:51.310
who are older adults,

00:09:51.412 --> 00:09:54.687
someone who has just started
to lose their vision.

00:09:54.773 --> 00:09:59.088
It's important to note that typically,
they don't have an understanding

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:03.212
of what accessibility means
or why it might be helpful to them.

00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:07.637
Honestly, they don't consider themselves
as a person who is blind.

00:10:08.772 --> 00:10:11.537
They're feeling emotional about
their diagnosis.

00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:13.631
They're scared of being helpless

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.612
and unsure if life's
going to ever be enjoyable again.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.930
Many have a hard time accepting help. Right?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.530
They feel like they're going to be
a burden to their loved ones.

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:25.583
All of this was factored
into how we think

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:30.950
about the experience of our new website
and how we're going to design this.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.625
Speaking to these individuals,

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:40.326
these were some of the things
they actually shared with us.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.794
A lot of them
really think about their symptom first.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.139
We wanted to focus in
on how their experience have changed

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:54.077
at the same time
that their vision loss has.

00:10:54.729 --> 00:10:56.694
Losing vision often means

00:10:56.773 --> 00:10:59.040
they're kinda using tools

00:10:59.064 --> 00:11:02.591
that aren't necessarily
traditional accessibility tools.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.770
Someone had shared,

00:11:03.874 --> 00:11:06.675
"I take a photo on my phone
and then I zoom in."

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.707
They're not using the Zoom feature.

00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:12.014
They're doing things
in roundabout ways

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.872
of compensating
for their change in their vision.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:19.859
A lot of these things they shared

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.172
really did help us factor
into the user experience.

00:11:27.602 --> 00:11:30.102
One of the things
I wanted to share with all of you

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:31.897
is, when someone says

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:34.698
they're losing their vision
or they have low vision,

00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:38.634
the vision loss experience
is not the same.

00:11:39.026 --> 00:11:41.247
For example, if you look here,

00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:43.374
somebody with diabetic retinopathy

00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:48.994
experiences spotty vision
when they're looking out.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.687
Somebody with macular degeneration
has lost their central field of vision.

00:11:54.894 --> 00:12:00.076
Someone with retinitis pigmentosa
has lost their peripheral field of vision.

00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.634
All of these things are really important

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.369
when we take into account
the user's mindset and the experience.

00:12:07.424 --> 00:12:10.982
A solution that works great
for one diagnosis

00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:16.743
may not be entirely helpful
to somebody else with another diagnosis.

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:23.129
So, bringing things back
to the UX perspective,

00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:25.038
we created some user stories

00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:27.598
to help understand
the journey users go through

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:29.561
as they explore Braille Institute.

00:12:29.653 --> 00:12:32.874
We found the
most important thing we could do

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:35.683
is answer their many questions.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:38.385
When they come to Braille Institute,

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:43.340
they are wanting to understand
what kind of support do we offer.

00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:46.351
Do we have things
that are online or in person?

00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:51.329
Do the--are the symptoms I'm experiencing

00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:56.261
typical of somebody
who has macular degeneration?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.043
Again, we wanted
to ultimately help to reassure them

00:13:01.152 --> 00:13:03.102
that they were in the right place

00:13:03.196 --> 00:13:07.491
and that Braille Institute is
here and available to help them.

00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.021
Again, we really wanted to create

00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:14.827
a highly personalized,
highly accessible website.

00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:19.759
>> JEREMY: Alright. Thanks, Sandy.

00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:24.842
Now turning to the solution
that we implemented for the site,

00:13:25.028 --> 00:13:26.028
one of the things

00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:28.265
that we had to think about
right off the bat

00:13:28.328 --> 00:13:32.371
was what our major UX approach
was going to be to the site

00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:33.625
to ensure that people

00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:36.049
with all of the uniqueness
of their experience

00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:39.494
could understand
that Braille Institute is for them

00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:42.631
and that we have offerings
that will meet their needs.

00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:44.409
The big decision we made up front

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.242
is that we would create
a personalized experience.

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:51.549
The two major ways
that we chose to personalize the site are,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.760
first of all, make sure

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.104
that somebody coming to the site
for the first time

00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:58.456
can feel comfortable looking at the site
if they have vision.

00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:04.465
Reading and navigating
can be as comfortable, as possible

00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:08.349
so they don't--so that they'll visit
as many pages as possible

00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:11.612
and that they'll find the information
that they came looking for.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.794
The second way is

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:16.831
we wanted to find out
some key traits about the user

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:21.399
and then suggest offerings and stories
of other users to them

00:14:21.504 --> 00:14:26.005
that would resonate and lead them
to the services that they ultimately need.

00:14:27.427 --> 00:14:30.171
I'm going to do
a quick demo now of the live site

00:14:30.234 --> 00:14:32.759
and show
how all of these things kinda work together

00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:34.741
to create this personalized experience.

00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:35.743
And then we'll come back

00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:39.583
and walk through some of the details
of how that was implemented.

00:14:40.158 --> 00:14:44.237
Now I'm on the Braille Institute website.
This is the top of the home page.

00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:47.089
What we're looking at here is

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.587
a presentation
that quickly onboards a user

00:14:51.283 --> 00:14:55.344
to make sure that they understand
what Braille Institute is all about

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:58.928
and, of course, allow them
to quickly dive into the personalization.

00:14:59.844 --> 00:15:03.203
First, we see at the top
a site header with the logo and the menu.

00:15:03.313 --> 00:15:05.113
Then, directly to the right of that,

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:10.169
the next thing somebody would encounter is
a button that says Text Size and Contrast.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.119
If I click that, it
opens up and reveals three checkboxes.

00:15:14.236 --> 00:15:16.058
There's a large text checkbox,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.889
a light mode checkbox,
and a dark mode checkbox.

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:21.272
Very simple, three quick options.

00:15:21.894 --> 00:15:25.489
It's not a big panel with lots of settings
that you can explore.

00:15:25.755 --> 00:15:26.805
It's the three things

00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:29.659
that we deemed
most users would benefit from.

00:15:29.743 --> 00:15:31.458
So, I could click Large Text,

00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:36.502
and most of the smaller text on the page
goes up to 150%.

00:15:36.884 --> 00:15:40.935
I can also choose dark mode
if that's what's most comfortable for me,

00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:43.336
and it'll turn
all of the background to black

00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:44.792
and all of the text to white

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:49.270
and make the experience
a lot more comfortable to look at.

00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:53.690
That will allow me
to get comfortable with the website

00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:56.439
and begin exploring
in the way that suits me best.

00:15:57.179 --> 00:15:59.879
The next thing we would see
at the top of the homepage

00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:02.688
is a headline that says,
"We're So Much More Than Braille."

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:05.307
It explains in a little bit of copy

00:16:05.362 --> 00:16:08.343
that they're free life-changing services,
classes, and more

00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:10.391
for people with low vision
to no vision.

00:16:10.717 --> 00:16:11.867
Then, right under that,

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.327
we have a call to action link
that says "Take Our Quiz."

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:19.520
Right away, we're guiding people
into that three-step quiz that I mentioned

00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:22.572
to hopefully learn something
about the user

00:16:22.643 --> 00:16:26.742
and then be able to suggest things
that will be perfectly suited to them.

00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:30.905
If I click that link,
I'm going to proceed to the next page.

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:35.327
Now, I'm on a page that says "Take Our Quiz" as the page title.

00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:39.318
Then, below that, it says one of three.

00:16:39.462 --> 00:16:41.759
The first question is
what level of vision?

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:44.923
It says select one,
low vision or no vision.

00:16:45.017 --> 00:16:46.417
There are two radio buttons.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.088
I'm going to choose low vision

00:16:48.147 --> 00:16:50.547
and hit the next button
that appears under that.

00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:52.851
Now, I'm presented
with question two of three.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.910
What age group?

00:16:54.086 --> 00:16:56.408
I can choose adult, youth, or child.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.086
Let's say, I'm an adult.

00:16:58.945 --> 00:16:59.945
I click next.

00:17:00.053 --> 00:17:03.253
Now, I'm on question three of three.
How would you like to learn?

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:07.937
I can see there are three options,
self-paced, online, or in-person.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.417
Depending on where I'm located,

00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:13.720
Braille Institute has centers
in Southern California.

00:17:13.852 --> 00:17:16.102
Let's say
that I'm not in Southern California,

00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:19.206
and I can learn online
through Microsoft Teams.

00:17:19.308 --> 00:17:23.079
Let me check online
as my preferred way to learn.

00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:24.394
Now, I click Next.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.766
Now, I'm presented with some results.

00:17:28.804 --> 00:17:30.184
It says your results,

00:17:30.857 --> 00:17:35.355
filtered recommendations just for you,
Adult with Low Vision, Online.

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:37.413
It repeats my answers back to me

00:17:37.538 --> 00:17:41.544
to ensure that they're correct
and that it recognizes who I am.

00:17:41.844 --> 00:17:43.094
Then, it says under that,

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:46.045
"Based on your results,
check out this featured offering."

00:17:46.142 --> 00:17:47.915
I can see that there's a card

00:17:47.986 --> 00:17:50.490
with a green bar across the top
with a title.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.087
It tells me
it's understanding vision loss.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:55.816
It's a workshop.
It's available online.

00:17:56.258 --> 00:17:59.354
Then, I can scroll through
a few more suggested offerings

00:17:59.401 --> 00:18:02.211
that match the three questions I answered.

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:03.249
Under that,

00:18:03.305 --> 00:18:06.008
it says, "explore
more offerings selected for you."

00:18:06.095 --> 00:18:08.195
There's a button
that says, "more offerings."

00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:10.445
I click that link.

00:18:10.571 --> 00:18:15.164
Now, I'm taken to a big page
that says, "All Offerings."

00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.912
It repeats filtered recommendations
just for you,

00:18:19.022 --> 00:18:20.641
Adult with Low Vision, Online.

00:18:20.687 --> 00:18:22.757
I can see as I go from page to page,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.820
it's following me

00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:28.708
and reiterating
that I have selected those three answers

00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:30.614
and that it's personalized for me,

00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:33.677
and everything on this page
is going to reflect what I chose.

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:34.875
Underneath that,

00:18:34.952 --> 00:18:38.620
there's a set of topics
that all is checked,

00:18:38.711 --> 00:18:39.777
but there's a few others,

00:18:39.832 --> 00:18:43.275
including art and music,
critical thinking, health, and wellness.

00:18:43.977 --> 00:18:45.827
Then, there's one called life skills.

00:18:45.889 --> 00:18:47.217
Let's say I'm interested in learning

00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:50.120
about life skills
as an adult with low vision.

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:51.569
I can click that.

00:18:51.754 --> 00:18:52.754
It gets selected,

00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:55.241
and it slides me down
to a list of results.

00:18:55.303 --> 00:18:58.981
I can see that same card style
with the green bar across the top.

00:18:59.615 --> 00:19:03.024
Orientation and Mobility Consultation
is the first one.

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:06.079
Independent Living Skills is the next one.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.701
If I continue down farther,

00:19:07.764 --> 00:19:10.841
I can see
accessible transportation options.

00:19:11.056 --> 00:19:13.117
It's a workshop
that's available online.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.761
I can discover
Accessible Transportation Services

00:19:15.847 --> 00:19:18.696
to get around my city, county, or country.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:21.436
Let's say I'm interested
in learning more about that.

00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:22.491
I can click that.

00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:25.251
Now, it opens a new tab.

00:19:26.525 --> 00:19:30.009
I'm taken to a whole page
about that particular offering.

00:19:30.189 --> 00:19:32.762
I can scroll down and
see the workshop details.

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:35.436
It costs nothing.
It's free.

00:19:36.032 --> 00:19:39.217
I can see the ways to learn
that it's available online

00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:42.641
and the dates and times
that are available for that,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.532
where I can join
through Teams or Zoom.

00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:48.137
If I scroll down, I can see more.

00:19:48.238 --> 00:19:50.188
What will I learn?
What should I expect?

00:19:50.217 --> 00:19:51.387
Then, after that,

00:19:51.677 --> 00:19:54.266
a registration form
if I'm ready to sign up for it.

00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:58.717
That's a quick demo of how,
right from the beginning of the website,

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:02.846
you're onboarded, made more comfortable,
recognized as a person,

00:20:03.386 --> 00:20:05.550
and suggested some content

00:20:05.613 --> 00:20:08.691
to get started with on the website
in a personalized way.

00:20:10.386 --> 00:20:11.863
So, yeah, to reiterate,

00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:16.282
very simple options
for choosing text and contrast.

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:23.959
Three quick questions,
gathering some key traits about the user.

00:20:24.772 --> 00:20:27.128
Then,
some suggested personalized results.

00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:31.897
So, now, let's talk a little bit
about some details

00:20:31.989 --> 00:20:34.665
in the design and content
of what we just looked at.

00:20:35.247 --> 00:20:41.180
Every last part of the design and content
had to be carefully considered

00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:45.715
to make sure that it was clearing the path
for an easy, seamless user experience.

00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:50.252
First of all, ya know, setting a really good, solid type scale

00:20:50.329 --> 00:20:51.329
that's hierarchical--

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:55.177
headings, body text,
callout text, captions--

00:20:55.231 --> 00:20:56.979
making sure
that there's clear hierarchy

00:20:57.027 --> 00:21:00.139
and that text
is a little larger than average

00:21:00.209 --> 00:21:03.073
is something that we found
to be helpful for a user

00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:05.657
so that it's closer

00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:08.651
to what they would be
comfortable looking at on a webpage.

00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:13.156
When we implemented
the large text feature,

00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:14.869
one of the decisions we made was

00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:18.348
that only the smaller
heading sizes and body text

00:21:18.404 --> 00:21:19.424
would get bigger.

00:21:19.473 --> 00:21:21.918
The larger headings,
heading level one and two,

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.988
were already large enough
to be seen by nearly all users.

00:21:26.387 --> 00:21:27.827
We didn't enlarge those.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.801
We only enlarged the smaller text,

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:30.834
and we had to make sure

00:21:30.836 --> 00:21:34.686
that the hierarchy of the large
and small text was still clear,

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:37.401
and you could tell
what the information was conveying.

00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:42.219
Another feature of the design
are these black guiding lines.

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:43.305
You may have noticed

00:21:44.551 --> 00:21:49.030
black lines surrounding cards,
grouping things on the page,

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:51.098
also horizontal black lines

00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:54.474
defining the boundaries
between sections of the page

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.662
as you scroll down.

00:21:56.268 --> 00:21:59.333
High contrast,
obviously black and white primarily,

00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:03.198
but these lines
really serve another purpose

00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:05.279
for a certain kind of user.

00:22:05.668 --> 00:22:06.835
It's been long known

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:12.392
that people generally explore
large web pages in kind of an F-shaped pattern.

00:22:12.714 --> 00:22:15.036
Heat maps have shown this in the past,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.280
where people tend to start
in the upper left

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:19.588
and they go down
the left side of the page

00:22:19.663 --> 00:22:22.713
looking for the start of information
of what's available,

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:25.030
and then they'll look across
from left to right

00:22:25.138 --> 00:22:28.320
to read that content
and see what it's all about.

00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:32.488
That really becomes
extremely important

00:22:32.543 --> 00:22:35.254
when we're talking
about a low vision user

00:22:35.317 --> 00:22:38.801
who's using a screen magnifier
to explore a page.

00:22:39.488 --> 00:22:41.038
A screen magnifier is something

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:46.182
that will enlarge
a small slice of the page

00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:48.098
and only focus on that part,

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:51.573
and then somebody can pan around
in four directions

00:22:51.651 --> 00:22:53.091
to explore the web page.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:54.906
On this slide,

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.546
the left-hand screenshot shows

00:22:56.773 --> 00:22:59.794
the Braille Institute homepage
fully undimmed,

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:04.168
where a typical sighted user could just
take in all the information at a glance.

00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:07.763
The middle screenshot shows
most of that screen dimmed,

00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:10.589
and all that's lit up
is the upper left corner,

00:23:10.716 --> 00:23:12.416
where all you can see is the logo.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.540
That might be all

00:23:13.595 --> 00:23:16.644
that a person using a screen magnifier
can see.

00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:21.013
They're moving
that little rectangle of brightness

00:23:21.061 --> 00:23:22.123
around the screen

00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:23.423
to explore what's there.

00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:26.835
The direction they might explore
is to first move to the right

00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:29.060
to see what's at the top of the page,

00:23:29.147 --> 00:23:33.074
in which case they would explore
and find the menu button next,

00:23:33.336 --> 00:23:36.236
and then they would find
the text size and contrast button.

00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:39.159
We're giving them things
in the order of priority

00:23:39.464 --> 00:23:40.984
by moving from left to right.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.369
Then they might go back
to the left-hand axis

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.410
and go down,

00:23:44.412 --> 00:23:47.305
and the next thing they would
discover is the main headline,

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:48.964
"We Are So Much More Than Braille."

00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:52.266
They might move to the right
to read that headline,

00:23:52.368 --> 00:23:54.521
then back to the left and then down again,

00:23:54.889 --> 00:23:57.798
in which case
they'll find the next bit of text

00:23:58.096 --> 00:23:59.776
and the "Take Our Quiz" button.

00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:02.680
They might move to the right
while they're reading that text

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:05.959
and then discover that
there's a video just to the right of that.

00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:07.723
The play button for the video

00:24:07.725 --> 00:24:10.787
is positioned
in the left-hand quadrant of the video

00:24:10.873 --> 00:24:13.080
so that you see
that it's a video right away,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.900
without having to go further right.

00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:18.492
Then you move back to the left-hand axis
and continue down.

00:24:18.788 --> 00:24:21.994
You'll encounter a black divider line,
horizontal line,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.285
signaling that you've now entered
a new section of the page,

00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:27.778
and that pattern
repeats throughout the page.

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:29.866
You don't have to see
everything at once

00:24:29.928 --> 00:24:31.861
to know where you are

00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:34.551
and what's grouped
and associated with what.

00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:38.833
That was a really important decision
for the screen magnifier user.

00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:43.489
Next, is we positioned images

00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:47.122
on the right-hand side
of the offering cards,

00:24:47.225 --> 00:24:49.967
and that was really important
in order to ensure

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:52.219
that people who have trouble

00:24:52.352 --> 00:24:57.221
seeing photography
and recognizing elements in photography

00:24:57.292 --> 00:24:58.549
due to the contrast

00:24:58.862 --> 00:25:01.781
could completely ignore
the photos on the page.

00:25:01.812 --> 00:25:04.562
If they're traveling
down the left-hand side of the page

00:25:04.589 --> 00:25:06.389
where all of the information starts,

00:25:06.898 --> 00:25:10.568
they can read the text
and ignore the images if they prefer.

00:25:12.091 --> 00:25:15.159
We also spent a lot of time
writing descriptive text,

00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:20.143
making sure that all of the labels
for links and buttons, and form fields

00:25:20.226 --> 00:25:22.757
were very clear, unambiguous.

00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:23.874
For instance,

00:25:23.957 --> 00:25:27.131
what's the difference
between a youth and a child

00:25:27.217 --> 00:25:29.017
when you're answering that question?

00:25:29.176 --> 00:25:31.694
It's the age range
that the person is within,

00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:34.368
and so we define that right up front

00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:38.416
so that it's clear what you're choosing
and making sure it matches what you need.

00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:42.968
We spent a lot of time under the hood
making sure

00:25:43.031 --> 00:25:45.694
that roles, labels, and regions
were correct

00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:48.379
for assistive technology
for screen reader users.

00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:50.735
Alt text for images,

00:25:51.456 --> 00:25:54.927
roles for buttons and links,
and videos and headings,

00:25:55.955 --> 00:25:58.562
labels for all of those elements,

00:25:58.906 --> 00:26:01.184
landmark regions for parts of the page,

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.913
all of this aids a screen reader user
to gather what's on the page

00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.900
and be able to quickly navigate
among that information.

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:16.535
Once we had created a set of pages
that constituted a flow through the site,

00:26:16.653 --> 00:26:18.840
such as the demo
I did a few minutes ago,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.604
we chose to put a prototype of this
in front of users

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.788
and to watch them explore it
and observe how well it worked

00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:27.866
so that we could learn

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:30.755
about the points of friction
within the experience

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.996
and make improvements

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.589
before actually developing
the entire site.

00:26:35.847 --> 00:26:40.170
The typical process
we would follow for usability testing

00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:44.487
is that we would make a prototype
in design software, such as Figma,

00:26:44.917 --> 00:26:47.308
where it's like an image of the design,

00:26:47.387 --> 00:26:51.651
and we would link screens together
into a clickable prototype.

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.349
It's not an actual website.

00:26:53.413 --> 00:26:56.625
It's more a facsimile of the website,

00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:57.695
but it would give us

00:26:57.926 --> 00:26:59.891
something we could rapidly create

00:27:00.016 --> 00:27:03.329
and put in front of people
to explore how well it works.

00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:05.273
Well, in this situation,

00:27:05.414 --> 00:27:08.032
since a lot
of the users of Braille Institute

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.213
are coming to the site

00:27:09.364 --> 00:27:10.981
using assistive technology

00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:15.107
or screen magnification, screen readers,
other tools,

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:19.403
that method for testing
wasn't going to work

00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:22.499
because what a screen reader needs

00:27:22.593 --> 00:27:25.005
for someone who's blind
and they're listening to the page

00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:30.417
is really a fully developed set of HTML
for a web page

00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:35.337
that can identify content elements
with roles and states and attributes

00:27:35.713 --> 00:27:38.137
so you know what content is there.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.245
The underlying material of a website,
which is code,

00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:45.279
had to be present in our prototype

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:48.990
for it to even work
with that kind of user.

00:27:49.721 --> 00:27:52.026
Of course,
it had to be usable with a keyboard

00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:55.822
and other expectations
for this kind of user.

00:27:56.803 --> 00:27:59.252
What we chose to make
with our prototype was

00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:02.535
the starting
of the actual development of the website.

00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:07.133
We started building out in a rough state
some of these key pages

00:28:07.188 --> 00:28:10.845
and actually just setting up
the bones of the WordPress website.

00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.641
Now, a quick aside

00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:14.826
on how we developed
the WordPress website,

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.420
including this prototype,

00:28:16.965 --> 00:28:20.815
we had to make a decision on the tools
that we were going to use in WordPress.

00:28:20.904 --> 00:28:24.710
One of the decisions we made early on
was to use the Divi theme,

00:28:24.773 --> 00:28:26.811
which comes with a visual builder,

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:31.343
and to amend
some of Divi's shortcomings

00:28:31.426 --> 00:28:33.395
when it comes to accessibility through

00:28:33.482 --> 00:28:36.136
there's a special plugin
called Divi Accessibility.

00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:38.617
We wrote some custom JavaScript too

00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:43.220
to amend some of the downsides
of some of the Divi content.

00:28:44.063 --> 00:28:47.213
You might be wondering,
well, why not just use WordPress blocks?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.436
The WordPress accessibility team has
been developing

00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:52.636
and putting a lot of effort
into the block editor

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.409
and full site editing
and block theming,

00:28:55.464 --> 00:28:57.664
and it's really moving
in a great direction.

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:59.518
We're huge fans of that effort.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.741
We do lots of websites that way.

00:29:02.384 --> 00:29:04.013
There were a few considerations

00:29:04.365 --> 00:29:10.106
when we decided to use Divi
to create the visual design of the site.

00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:11.709
One was that

00:29:11.887 --> 00:29:15.597
Braille Institute has
a very small content editing team in-house

00:29:15.636 --> 00:29:19.262
that they could train and coordinate
when using Divi.

00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:24.232
Also, none of those people at the time
had a visual disability,

00:29:24.356 --> 00:29:27.716
so nobody needed
the editor of the web content

00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:29.412
to be fully accessible.

00:29:29.882 --> 00:29:33.823
We could depend on that
as a constraint.

00:29:34.398 --> 00:29:35.398
Also,

00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:38.217
this would allow Braille Institute
to create

00:29:38.334 --> 00:29:42.278
new layouts and new design patterns
for the website over time

00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:46.459
without having to invest effort
in development and writing more code.

00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:51.299
They could create
layouts, pages, design patterns

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:54.268
with ease using the visual builder.

00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:59.179
Finally, Braille Institute has
a WordPress developer in-house on staff

00:29:59.274 --> 00:30:00.274
who knows Divi

00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:03.840
and can maintain the accessibility
of the website that we created.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.511
For all of those reasons,
it made sense to use Divi as the theme.

00:30:07.644 --> 00:30:09.700
We also used
a couple of other plugins

00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:12.769
to supplement that
for the front end of the website.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.103
Gravity Forms is well known
for having highly accessible forms.

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:20.098
We used that.
We styled them using Divi.

00:30:20.427 --> 00:30:24.488
G Translate provides
the language translation for the website.

00:30:24.707 --> 00:30:27.557
It's available
in about a half dozen different languages.

00:30:28.477 --> 00:30:29.477
It works well

00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:33.174
in that it changes the lang
attribute on the HTML tag

00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:37.876
to the actual language
that the page is translated into,

00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:40.291
so that a screen reader can hear
all of the text

00:30:40.343 --> 00:30:42.433
pronounced properly
in that language.

00:30:44.747 --> 00:30:46.075
For the usability testing,

00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:49.806
we did in-person moderated testing
for most of the users.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.514
There were 15 users in three groups.

00:30:52.705 --> 00:30:57.065
A low vision set of users of five,
five blind users,

00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.915
and then five sighted users.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.272
They used
a variety of assistive technologies.

00:31:02.533 --> 00:31:05.965
We had JAWS available, NVDA,
both screen readers,

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.172
as well as ZoomText
for screen magnification.

00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:14.815
We went on site
in Braille Institute's Los Angeles center.

00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:16.929
We had a room set up

00:31:17.031 --> 00:31:20.775
with large monitors
and a large-format keyboard,

00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:22.773
as well as a mouse available.

00:31:24.106 --> 00:31:27.755
In addition to those software solutions
that I mentioned a minute ago.

00:31:28.185 --> 00:31:31.009
We sat alongside the user
and had them click through

00:31:31.092 --> 00:31:34.809
and try to complete
a series of tasks on the prototype.

00:31:34.903 --> 00:31:38.567
We recorded and observed
what they were doing

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.424
so that we could collate our findings
and make changes to the design.

00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:45.053
What we learned,

00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:48.747
there's a few things
that we altered in the design

00:31:49.193 --> 00:31:50.993
which you will see on the live site.

00:31:51.683 --> 00:31:52.683
The first thing is

00:31:52.741 --> 00:31:55.277
that the offering cards
that we had originally

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:02.060
had this eyebrow text above at the top
in that green bar in the offering card.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.517
It used to say things
like new, in-person, online,

00:32:06.947 --> 00:32:10.323
in the green bar
above the heading for the card.

00:32:11.503 --> 00:32:14.854
It was all grouped together
using the black lines

00:32:14.911 --> 00:32:18.894
to associate that content together
as one offering.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.049
The difficulty with that is that,

00:32:22.513 --> 00:32:27.319
without the styles available here,
if you're just listening to the webpage,

00:32:27.993 --> 00:32:32.142
you might hear a series of things
that are more like raw content.

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:35.649
This is what the page would look like

00:32:35.743 --> 00:32:38.200
without any style sheet
associated with it.

00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:41.690
You can see
that the new in-person and online text

00:32:42.191 --> 00:32:45.210
doesn't necessarily look associated
with what's below it.

00:32:45.404 --> 00:32:47.904
It could look just
as associated with what's above.

00:32:48.294 --> 00:32:51.390
That association of the black line
through the style sheet,

00:32:51.984 --> 00:32:54.344
when it's not available for some users

00:32:54.428 --> 00:32:56.278
who are, again, listening to the page

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.074
or are low vision
and can't see the design as well,

00:33:00.742 --> 00:33:01.997
made it more difficult.

00:33:02.726 --> 00:33:06.469
The change that we made was
to move the eyebrow text below the heading

00:33:06.835 --> 00:33:08.885
and move the heading
up into the green bar

00:33:08.974 --> 00:33:11.428
so that the heading, which is the title,

00:33:12.421 --> 00:33:15.784
precedes all of the content
that it's the title for.

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:17.279
That made a big difference.

00:33:18.388 --> 00:33:19.838
Another thing we did is that,

00:33:20.177 --> 00:33:22.112
the main menu panel has

00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:25.088
a series of toggle buttons
for each menu item

00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:27.953
that
expands the second-level navigation.

00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:31.655
Those were off to the right side
within the menu panel.

00:33:32.447 --> 00:33:33.497
We were finding users

00:33:33.555 --> 00:33:36.362
weren't always discovering those arrows
off to the right,

00:33:36.464 --> 00:33:39.574
and they were missing
that important action for navigating.

00:33:39.989 --> 00:33:42.960
What we did was
we moved the arrows back to the left side,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:48.194
to the left of the menu link
that it refers to.

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:50.196
The order is still going to be,

00:33:50.297 --> 00:33:52.410
when you're encountering the page
from top to bottom,

00:33:52.473 --> 00:33:56.060
the main menu parent link
followed by the arrow.

00:33:56.174 --> 00:34:00.152
It will go to the link first
and then to the left, to the arrow,

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.240
so that that hierarchy is still clear.

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:06.629
This made a big difference for users
traveling down the left side of the page.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.211
Also,
icons were present in the design.

00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:13.524
We were finding that,
the way these were implemented,

00:34:13.845 --> 00:34:16.371
it would create a pause
in a screen reader.

00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:19.570
Somebody would advance
to the next element on the page

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680
and hear nothing.

00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:25.883
That minor stumble
was tripping up a lot of people,

00:34:26.032 --> 00:34:27.182
and they were confused.

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:30.167
We realized
we don't really need these icons.

00:34:30.274 --> 00:34:32.955
We have text labels
associated with them already.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.917
We just got rid of the icons fonts,
and that removed that hurdle.

00:34:38.892 --> 00:34:40.572
We added more descriptive text.

00:34:40.967 --> 00:34:44.295
The main call to action on the homepage
used to say, "Get Started,"

00:34:44.547 --> 00:34:45.947
which is a little ambiguous.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.362
What will I get if I click get started?

00:34:48.998 --> 00:34:49.998
What am I starting?

00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:52.794
We changed it to say, "Take Our Quiz."

00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:56.954
We added some text above it that says, "Get personalized recommendations,"

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.077
so you know what you're going to find
if you click that link.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.710
Finally,

00:35:04.255 --> 00:35:06.646
perhaps the largest change was

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.116
when you are on the all offerings page,

00:35:09.662 --> 00:35:12.966
the topic selection
is a series of radio buttons.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.991
We had styled them
to look like radio buttons,

00:35:16.093 --> 00:35:19.541
and they interacted with them
just like radio buttons.

00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:21.525
The way it worked was

00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:24.122
you would change the radio button
to another option,

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.642
and you would hear in a screen reader
something like 13 offerings below.

00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.454
Then you would have to move

00:35:31.573 --> 00:35:34.229
through the rest of the list
and down the page,

00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:38.065
and then find the 13 results
further down the page.

00:35:38.498 --> 00:35:41.168
This was proving to be a lot of work
for some users.

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:43.339
They didn't quite know where to go

00:35:43.418 --> 00:35:46.641
or where the content was located,
or what was happening.

00:35:48.403 --> 00:35:49.697
What we changed it to was

00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:54.018
we made the radio buttons behave
a little more like regular buttons.

00:35:54.113 --> 00:36:00.527
They look like separate clickable objects,
not a form field with one setting.

00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:05.556
Also, you can individually focus
on each one of these like a regular button

00:36:05.595 --> 00:36:07.985
and hit enter or space bar
on the keyboard.

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.662
When you do that,
you make that selection,

00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:14.940
it will slide you down and move focus
to the start of the results list.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:18.000
It skips over
all the intermediate content,

00:36:18.188 --> 00:36:22.492
takes you right to the information
that you had just made a selection to see.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.110
Those were some of the things we did
and some of the things we learned.

00:36:28.205 --> 00:36:30.833
The site has been live
for about a year now.

00:36:30.912 --> 00:36:32.896
We've seen some positive results.

00:36:33.128 --> 00:36:35.128
Sandy is going to tell us some of those.

00:36:36.765 --> 00:36:37.865
>> SANDY: Thanks, Jeremy.

00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:43.771
Yeah, given all of the things
that were designed into this website,

00:36:44.827 --> 00:36:46.251
you can see here

00:36:46.353 --> 00:36:51.375
our first 12 months of the website
have been extremely positive.

00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:53.544
The key headline is

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:56.625
we're seeing more people
coming to the website.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.536
Traffic is up 17%.

00:36:58.692 --> 00:37:02.052
We're seeing more new people
coming to our website.

00:37:02.107 --> 00:37:04.005
That's up about 7%.

00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:06.673
They're actually viewing more content.

00:37:06.854 --> 00:37:08.307
More page views,

00:37:08.386 --> 00:37:10.592
they're spending more time
on our site,

00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:12.549
and they're doing more things.

00:37:12.618 --> 00:37:15.645
They're taking action.
They're more engaged.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.865
That's up 117%.

00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:20.811
We're sharing some of the key things
people are doing on our website.

00:37:20.913 --> 00:37:23.571
They're downloading our font.
They're contacting us.

00:37:23.983 --> 00:37:26.833
They're signing up for workshops.
They're taking our quiz.

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:31.641
Really, all of the things
we intended the website to do,

00:37:31.892 --> 00:37:34.038
it is doing and meeting those needs.

00:37:34.617 --> 00:37:39.571
We included a customer satisfaction survey
on the website as well.

00:37:40.072 --> 00:37:42.700
We have been receiving
really positive feedback.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.786
People are commenting
on how accessible the website is.

00:37:45.888 --> 00:37:51.484
Again, really strong satisfaction
with their experience on our website.

00:37:57.303 --> 00:37:58.503
>> JEREMY: With that story,

00:37:58.602 --> 00:38:00.996
we wanted to leave you
with a few takeaways

00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:03.340
on how, if you manage a website,

00:38:04.058 --> 00:38:09.294
you either manage a site, develop a site,
design sites for WordPress,

00:38:09.547 --> 00:38:12.410
how you can be more hyperaccessible,

00:38:12.495 --> 00:38:16.368
which is really going
beyond requirements and compliance,

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:20.646
and to make something
supremely easy to use for people.

00:38:20.942 --> 00:38:22.592
First thing we would recommend is

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:24.255
make sure to talk with users

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.609
and understand
how they think about themselves

00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:28.952
and what they know.

00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:32.560
Not everyone is up to speed
on what accessibility is

00:38:32.598 --> 00:38:34.614
and all the technologies
and the techniques

00:38:34.672 --> 00:38:37.475
and how to go quickly.

00:38:38.005 --> 00:38:43.097
A lot of the users for Braille Institute
felt like they were new to these concepts,

00:38:43.214 --> 00:38:45.264
and the smallest thing
could trip them up.

00:38:45.388 --> 00:38:47.371
Make sure you understand
what they know

00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:49.985
and how they think about the content.

00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:52.921
Also, consider
the experience across pages.

00:38:53.085 --> 00:38:57.837
Not just an individual page of content
leading you to a solution or an answer,

00:38:57.931 --> 00:39:01.907
but going through a journey
on a website

00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:04.944
and making sure that you are managing

00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:07.491
the amount of information
that someone's experiencing

00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:09.148
and creating continuity

00:39:09.553 --> 00:39:12.923
and guiding them
to the right ultimate endpoint

00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:14.145
on their visit.

00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:18.736
Also, make sure that
every design and content detail works

00:39:18.783 --> 00:39:20.163
to ease the experience.

00:39:20.537 --> 00:39:23.332
Small things
that web designers take for granted,

00:39:23.417 --> 00:39:28.647
like icons and staggered layouts
and other things such as that,

00:39:28.746 --> 00:39:31.085
might be major barriers to somebody

00:39:31.142 --> 00:39:35.279
that's not using
or experiencing the site

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.299
in the same way as the rest of us do.

00:39:38.799 --> 00:39:44.676
Really taking care to design
and write words that ease that experience

00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:45.801
is very important.

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:49.021
Be prepared to change course
when testing.

00:39:49.129 --> 00:39:50.129
You may find

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.213
that it's not just validating
all of your assumptions,

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.067
but it's showing you
critical information

00:39:56.364 --> 00:39:58.614
that will help you
make the experience better,

00:39:58.734 --> 00:40:00.984
and you may have to make
significant changes.

00:40:01.407 --> 00:40:04.164
Then, finally,
beware of common UI conventions,

00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:07.300
such as icons and irregular layouts,
as I mentioned.

00:40:07.706 --> 00:40:09.456
There are things that are shorthand

00:40:09.527 --> 00:40:11.981
that we all take for granted
and we use freely

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.918
when we're creating web experiences.

00:40:14.426 --> 00:40:17.852
You can certainly have
a really visually stunning website,

00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:21.614
but also have a layer of experience

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.917
that accommodates people

00:40:23.027 --> 00:40:26.746
who are more comfortable
experiencing it differently,

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:28.055
and just keep that in mind

00:40:28.141 --> 00:40:31.874
that the shorthand and the conventions
that you're reaching for

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.820
might not work well for everyone.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.382
That's all we have today.

00:40:36.979 --> 00:40:39.929
It was exciting to share
what we've learned with you,

00:40:40.015 --> 00:40:42.165
and we're looking forward
to the discussion.

00:40:43.281 --> 00:40:44.281
>> SANDY: Thank you.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.750
Alexandra: Thank you so much, everyone.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.190
My name is Alexandra.

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:56.919
I'll be seeing this Q&amp;A session.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.619
First of all, thank you, Jeremy and Sandy.

00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:00.999
This is so exciting.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.950
I was seeing the results
and I was like,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.737
"Wow, it's incredible how much impact
and the effort that you all do

00:41:08.738 --> 00:41:10.390
and can have on people."

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.379
I'm also loving everyone
in the chat interacting.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:19.838
I loved that when DBM was mentioned,
everyone just started losing their minds

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:22.000
and bringing up different opinions.

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:24.429
We do have a couple of questions.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.179
The first one is
from Nassim, and they ask,

00:41:28.189 --> 00:41:33.460
"what are some best practices
for color contrast and text scaling

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.178
that work well for users with low vision
but don't break the layout

00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:38.500
for sighted users?"

00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:44.289
Jeremy: I think when it comes
to color contrast,

00:41:44.289 --> 00:41:47.350
obviously, there's certain contrast ratios
that we need to meet,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:53.679
and so getting it above 4.5
to 1 for normal text will ensure

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.710
that the most people can read
that text comfortably.

00:41:57.759 --> 00:41:58.808
Above that level,

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:02.499
there's quite a range of color hues
that you can use to create

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.690
a visually rich and engaging website.

00:42:05.229 --> 00:42:08.589
We're really committed
to meeting contrast ratios.

00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:13.730
In the case of Braille Institute,
it was AAA conformant

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.199
through the 7 to 1 ratio
with all the black and white.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.459
As far as text scaling goes,
this is where it gets a little tricky.

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:27.549
The way we implemented
the large text setting was custom

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.599
through JavaScript.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:33.849
We literally just change
a class that's on the body tag,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.209
I believe, that then causes
the style sheet to change

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.060
all of the smaller text to be larger.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.419
We had to be cognizant of the fact
that certain multi-column layouts,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.710
as the text gets bigger,

00:42:44.711 --> 00:42:47.349
making sure
that it doesn't break the layout.

00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:50.369
Because we weren't scaling
up very large words,

00:42:50.379 --> 00:42:51.789
like large headings,

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:55.689
it was unlikely that a single word
would suddenly stop fitting

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.070
within its container.

00:42:57.189 --> 00:43:00.368
Then also on this website,
we didn't use a lot of columns.

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:03.069
We used two-column layouts
in a lot of places,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.519
very seldom three-column layouts,
so there was a lot of room

00:43:06.609 --> 00:43:08.679
for that text to grow as it got larger.

00:43:09.159 --> 00:43:12.519
If you're implementing
a custom text scaler like we did,

00:43:13.179 --> 00:43:17.109
testing out all screen sizes,
all font sizes,

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.910
to make sure that nothing is broken.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.990
That's what I would add around that.

00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.201
Alexandra: Thank you so much, Jeremy.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.369
We do have a couple of questions,
so I'm trying to get to most of them.

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:34.570
Next one is from Luna,
and the question is,

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:39.068
"what was the cost and scale of remediating
this accessibility issues

00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:40.090
for your website?"

00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:47.680
Jeremy: I'm not entirely sure
the scope of that question,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.100
but when it comes to remediating
the accessibility issues,

00:43:52.769 --> 00:43:57.070
there was the accessibility shortcomings
in Divi that we had to remediate,

00:43:57.099 --> 00:43:58.099
which was

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.708
a pretty minor amount of work compared
to all the other research and design

00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:03.709
and testing.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.346
There were pretty
straightforward solutions

00:44:06.347 --> 00:44:07.689
to a lot of those issues,

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:11.260
including avoiding certain elements
within the Divi builder

00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:14.140
that just weren't accessible
and sticking to other ones.

00:44:15.059 --> 00:44:16.059
There was that,

00:44:16.359 --> 00:44:20.258
and then there was the remediating
the accessibility issues after testing

00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:21.259
that we found.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.559
Those things within the design,

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560
I think, were,

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.360
I would say, not earth shattering.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.779
Like moving a text field from
being above to below a heading was

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.599
a fairly simple design change
that we were able to make.

00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:39.999
Oftentimes, we found in usability testing
that a lot of what people respond

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.640
to are things like wording
and order of things on a page

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:50.918
to understand what something means,
and less of a complete negative reaction

00:44:50.919 --> 00:44:54.579
to a large decision that requires ripping
everything up and starting over.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.900
There might be some things that are

00:44:59.594 --> 00:45:03.580
a small lift to fix, but make
a major difference for users.

00:45:05.967 --> 00:45:07.900
Alexandra: Yeah, I agree,
it's really important

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.579
to test a product after it's done,
see what we can improve as well.

00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:16.449
Next question is from anonymous,
and they wanted to know if there are

00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:21.159
any considerations to different keyboards
the blind might use that when designing

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.660
we need to know.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.220
Jeremy: Different keyboards, yeah.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.578
Sandy, do you have anything to say
about large format keyboards

00:45:30.579 --> 00:45:33.039
and other types of devices?

00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:36.728
Sandy: Yeah, we did test when we did
the usability testing

00:45:36.729 --> 00:45:38.370
with large format keyboards.

00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:43.569
Those are where the actual keys are
in different colors for contrast,

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.520
the lettering itself are larger.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.639
Individuals who use refreshable braillers,

00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:50.869
they're using their own

00:45:51.729 --> 00:45:53.590
brailling type of a keyboard.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:56.499
Those
were some of the things we did include

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.709
in the usability testing.

00:46:00.669 --> 00:46:03.009
I'm not sure if there's
something more specific

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.080
that's being asked?

00:46:04.209 --> 00:46:06.109
But those were some of the key things.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:12.668
We teach classes for students to use
certain types of keyboards as well,

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.605
so they become familiar with that.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.700
Alexandra: Thank you.

00:46:18.039 --> 00:46:20.769
Next two questions I'm going
to try to put together,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.500
because they have to do with Divi.

00:46:23.049 --> 00:46:26.439
Taco says, "Equalize Digital recently researched

00:46:26.454 --> 00:46:28.810
the state of accessibility
for page builders.

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:30.549
Divi ranks very poorly.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.769
With this information,
would you consider picking

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:36.460
another page builder
in a future rebuild of the website?"

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.929
Added to that, James asks, "for people not using Divi,

00:46:40.959 --> 00:46:43.178
do you have any tips
for things to look out

00:46:43.179 --> 00:46:47.530
for in the WordPress site editor
that aren't natively accessible yet,

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.869
and workarounds for those things?"

00:46:53.529 --> 00:46:59.588
Jeremy: Yeah, so the question around choosing
a page builder or not is probably

00:46:59.589 --> 00:47:03.369
the most important thing that we stress
when beginning a new project.

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.469
This is a major decision.

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:06.739
Certain clients

00:47:07.479 --> 00:47:08.769
don't quite understand,

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.770
and others

00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:12.489
get it, and some have an opinion,
and some are like,

00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:14.139
"Whatever you recommend is fine,"

00:47:15.669 --> 00:47:17.769
because it does result in,

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.620
among other things,
saving all of your content

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.209
in a specific format.

00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:26.524
If you decide to migrate out in the future
to another theme or another builder,

00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:28.329
it can be a lot of work.

00:47:29.642 --> 00:47:32.971
Then, of course,
the upgrade roadmap

00:47:32.972 --> 00:47:35.821
for the theme itself could introduce
new features

00:47:35.822 --> 00:47:37.869
and other things that are not accessible.

00:47:37.869 --> 00:47:42.219
You're really weighing lots of options
when you're choosing which technology.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.468
Every time we encounter a new website,
we're like,

00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:50.319
"Here are the pros
and cons of all these factors

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.400
for each technology."

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.318
Then as far as the native block editor
and full site editing,

00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:58.300
I don't have a specific example in mind.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:03.458
One thing we found is that two
of the difficulties that come up

00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:07.268
with the block editor are how to build
things that are more complex

00:48:07.269 --> 00:48:08.269
in the block editor.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.680
Do you stick with--

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.450
for an example, there's no--

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.069
for an accordion block
or a tab block,

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.238
if you were to try to assemble that
out of a series of nested groups

00:48:19.239 --> 00:48:23.888
with buttons and tell the client,
"Just copy and paste this one thing

00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:27.219
in the list view of your page
to add new tabs or accordions."

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.179
That's often brittle and can break easily,
and then you've just broken

00:48:31.179 --> 00:48:34.478
the accessibility of your site
because a person didn't understand.

00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:36.479
They didn't do things in the right step.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.510
Do you create a custom block?

00:48:39.279 --> 00:48:41.380
There's a number of approaches
you can take there,

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.829
and that's where we find
the most challenge comes in.

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:47.319
Alexandra: Okay.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.509
