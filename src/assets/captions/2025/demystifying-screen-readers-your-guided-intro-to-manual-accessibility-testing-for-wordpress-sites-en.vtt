<v SHEROSE BADRUDDIN> Welcome
back to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.911
I'm Sherose Badruddin,
and I'm a Digital Accessibility Consultant

00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:41.811
with the University of North Carolina.

00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:45.461
Thank you for joining us for this session - Demystifying Screen Readers:

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:47.980
Your Guided Intro
to Manual Accessibility Testing

00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:48.981
for WordPress Sites.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.269
This is going to be presented
by Deneb Pulsipher and Akosua “Kosi” Asabere.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.301
Known as Captain Accessible,

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:57.345
Deneb gets excited
about the inherent ability

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:58.545
that the web provides

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.731
to let everyone access
the same information,

00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:03.140
whether they're able
to see or not, hear or not,

00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.161
use a mouse or not,
have no cognitive challenges or do.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.041
He believes the internet
can be accessed by nearly everyone

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.241
through regular technologies
like web browsers or assistive tech,

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.191
as long as it's coded right.

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.351
So, Deneb's passion is making
sure it is coded right,

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:19.750
which means thoroughly reviewing
all of his company's sites

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.629
before they release them
into the wild, and also providing

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.689
accessibility experience reviews
to owners of notable websites

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.740
in the public sphere.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:31.391
Kosi is a senior accessibility engineer
and inclusive design strategist

00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:35.950
with over a decade of experience advancing
digital accessibility across web,

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.931
mobile and enterprise platforms.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.831
As a native screen reader user
and former accessibility specialist

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:42.951
at the W3C,

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:46.810
she combines lived experience,
deep technical expertise

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.750
and leadership
in accessibility program management,

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.240
bridging the gap
between inclusive user needs

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.660
and sustainable accessibility solutions.

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:59.019
Kosi has led accessibility initiatives
across several industries,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.810
embedding best practices
into procurement pipelines,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.961
design systems, and engineering workflows.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.690
Her past roles
include Accessibility Manager

00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.320
at Lighthouse for the Blind
and IT Accessibility Specialist

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.821
at the University of Maryland.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.980
As an experienced assistive tech trainer,

to navigate digital environments
with JAWS and NVDA,

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:26.470
ZoomText, Dragon NaturallySpeaking,
and other assistive tools while

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.649
advising product teams
in identifying and remediating

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.219
real-world accessibility barriers
to ensure digital experiences

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.921
are not only compliant but intuitive,

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:39.100
equitable and genuinely usable.

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.179

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.063
<v DENEB PULSIPHER> Welcome
to our presentation

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:55.241
of Demystifying Screen Reader Use

00:03:55.242 --> 00:03:58.810
for Manual Testing of WordPress Sites
with the subtitle of Introduction

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.511
to the Screen Reader ropes Course.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.119
At the bottom right of the slide,
we have a QR code and a link

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:14.068
to the HTML version of our presentation
at bit.ly/sr-ropes-pres-wp.

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:16.841
That's the URL
you can use for the online version

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:17.861
of our presentation.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.649
Now, when I first got
into accessibility testing,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.959
I knew that manual testing was the thing
that every site needed in addition

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.260
to all the automatic testing,
but that the epitome

00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.589
or the gold standard of manual testing
was always put forth

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.030
as screen reader testing.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.030
When I first started trying
to do screen reader testing,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.891
I found it was really difficult.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.919
It was just this mystical process
I couldn't understand.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.471
I couldn't learn
the keystrokes and understand

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.550
how it all worked very well.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.350
It was just really difficult for me.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.630
In that time period,
I kept thinking to myself,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.079
"If there were a ropes course somewhere,
just a page that I could go

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.290
and I could play around with and do
different tasks to teach me

00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.841
the screen reader,
that would be very, very helpful.

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.019
There wasn't any such thing.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.019
I searched for it.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.451
After a little while,
I decided to make my own.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.350
I made this screen reader ropes course,
which we're introducing to you guys today

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.780
and hope that you find it as helpful
as I did.

00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:11.901
Next slide.

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:15.731
Hi,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.415
I'm Deneb, and I was
a high school English teacher

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:20.215
before getting into web development.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.960
To make the transition,
I took a coding bootcamp,

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.551
which featured one lecture
on accessibility in the entire 12 weeks.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.191
When I started my first development job
at SeaMonster Studios,

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.701
my boss assigned me to make
sure all the websites we put out

00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.699
were accessible, using any
of the several tools he suggested

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.450
or anything else I could figure out

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.010
to do it on my own.

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.861
In working to figure it out,

00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:47.380
I soon fell in love
with making sites accessible.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.469
I got accredited
as a web accessibility specialist

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.720
with the International Association
for Accessibility Professionals

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.119
and was given the only
slightly tongue-in-cheek job title

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.771
of Captain Accessible

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.751
at SeaMonster Studios.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.290
Now, I still get to check
all our sites for accessibility,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.340
but also get to write blog posts
and give presentations on accessibility

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:13.511
and create WordPress plugins
and other tools to help our clients

00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:15.401
and others with accessibility.

00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:18.581
I've participated
in the Accessibility Internet Rally

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.811
for the past four years.

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.321
I'm mentoring a great team this year,
as they work to produce

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.021
a fully accessible site
for a deserving non-profit.

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:29.800
I love accessibility,
and I love sharing what I know about it.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.460
I'm not
a native screen reader user myself,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.671
and I found it pretty challenging
to figure out

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.960
at first

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.051
how to use it to start testing with it.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.880
I put together the ropes course to create
a place for some guided practice.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.080
I'm excited to introduce you to it,
and I hope that you find it helpful.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.321
<v KOSI ASABERE> Good morning.

00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:58.391
My name is Akosua Asabere,
but most people call me Kosi.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.571
I am a digital accessibility engineer
and currently the head of accessibility

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.281
at a small design startup.

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.260
A little bit more about me,

00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.040
I bring a unique blend
of technical expertise

00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:18.760
and also lived experience as someone
who uses a screen reader in my day-to-day.

00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:24.560
I previously worked
as an accessibility specialist at the W3C,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.171
an accessibility manager at The Lighthouse for the Blind, Inc.,

00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:34.330
and as a IT accessibility specialist
at the University of Maryland,

00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:35.541
College Park.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.510
A lot of the work I do is informed
by my experiences working

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.100
as an accessibility trainer.

00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:45.520
Over the years, I've had
the opportunity to train

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:52.990
hundreds of assistive technology users
of all levels on screen readers like JAWS,

00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:58.571
NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack,
and magnification like ZoomText

00:07:58.801 --> 00:07:59.801
and SuperNova.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.339
In this section,
I'll be sharing my experiences

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.999
as a native screen reader user
and how you can learn

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.101
to test effectively

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.291
even without that native
screen reader experience.

00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:18.760
<v Deneb> All right, this slide,
Learning Goals and Objectives.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.460
Let's talk about why this topic matters.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.191
We've touched on it briefly,
but it can't be stressed

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:27.399
enough that screen reader testing
is essential to verify

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.389
the accessibility of WordPress sites,
but it does require specialized skills

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.921
that most professionals lack.

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:36.280
Kosi says that manual testing
with a screen reader is

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:40.030
a required part of any serious
accessibility evaluation.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.049
I like that because it really highlights
the fact that if you're serious

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.778
about accessibility,
you've got to test with screen readers.

00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:48.040
It's the only way.

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:49.691
In this session,

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:53.289
some things you'll gain,
you'll get a method to gain

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.651
the basic screen reader skills
for testing WordPress sites.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.290
That's through our introduction
to the ropes course.

00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:03.070
You'll also come to understand
some different navigation approaches taken

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.511
by native screen reader users.

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:09.340
This will help you get into the mindset
of a native screen reader tester

00:09:09.752 --> 00:09:11.452
so that you can be more effective.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.340
We'll also give you some resources
to communicate accessibility issues

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.461
effectively based upon
the insights that you get

00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:20.021
in your screen reader testing.

00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.191
Next slide.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.951
Session Overview slide.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.161
Okay. Let's talk about what you're going
to get from this presentation.

00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:30.159
We've got basically seven sections
that you're going to get.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.470
We'll go over some screen
reader usage stats.

00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:36.730
We'll talk about the native visual versus
native screen reader users' experience.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.610
We'll talk some screen reader basics
and cheat sheets,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.980
and then get to the most exciting part,
the introduction

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.071
to the screen reader ropes course,

00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:46.841
which can help you build up
some of those skills

00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:47.871
that you need.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.969
We'll talk about the visual
and screen reader disconnect,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.520
which is a very interesting topic
that I think you'll find illuminating.

00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:59.650
We'll point you at some documentation
and remediation resources,

00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:04.029
and then release you into the world, say,
"The world is your oyster to do

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.711
some screen reader practice."

00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:06.741
Next slide.

00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:11.611
Let's talk about some screen
reader usage statistics

00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:16.202
per the WebAIM survey
on screen reader usage back in 2024,

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:18.461
which is the most recent one, actually.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.730
That revealed
that about 83.5% of the respondents

00:10:24.731 --> 00:10:27.220
were either blind or low vision,
which isn't surprising.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.951
That's the largest portion
of the respondents,

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:36.820
but the other respondents
were not an insignificant level either.

00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:39.221
Deaf and hard-of-hearing were 6.8%.

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:44.185
Cognitive and learning disabilities,
people who had those were about 5.2%.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:48.100
People with motor disabilities, 2.2%.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.054
With other disabilities were 4.9%.

00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:56.723
The one that surprised me was respondents
who used screen readers

00:10:56.803 --> 00:11:01.634
who had no disability at all or associated
with no disability was 10%.

00:11:01.764 --> 00:11:06.304
That's quite a large number
of screen reader users

00:11:06.544 --> 00:11:09.364
not associating with any disability.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:15.040
This just says let's help them
all by making sure that we're testing

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:18.371
all of our WordPress sites and other sites
with a screen reader to make sure

00:11:18.371 --> 00:11:21.851
that this technology
can be used effectively.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.150
Next slide.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.071
Let's talk
about the visual surfer experience.

00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:30.160
First off, some dwell-time statistics.

00:11:30.581 --> 00:11:34.869
Back in 2023, there was a study
that showed that the average time spent

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.991
on a website was just 53 seconds.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.650
What that highlights to me
is that we, visual surfers,

00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:45.730
are not really great readers,
but we are great at deciding

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.231
whether it's worth it to read.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.210
In those 53 seconds,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:52.240
we take in mostly the vibe of the site.

00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:55.210
We may skim the headings,
we may glance over some images,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.010
but we decide in 10 seconds or less,
according to the Nielsen Norman Group,

00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:03.940
whether we want to stay on that site
or bounce and go to a different one.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.030
Next slide.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.171
The way that visual surfers

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.359
decide so quickly whether to stay
or go is they categorize everything

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.750
into either informative
or interactive elements in their minds.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.850
With informative elements,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.491
their goal is to get the information
as quickly as possible.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.650
They're going to read
through the headings real quick,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.590
they may glance at the images,
they may read the pull quotes

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.590
or not,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.221
but they're going to get
the information as quick as possible.

00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.620
Then they're going to look
at interactive elements,

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.581
which their minds are going to group
according to past interactions.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.281
They see a form,
and they're going to immediately know

00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:41.530
whether they want to fill it out or not.

00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:43.690
They're going to see a slider,
they're immediately going

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.040
to ignore it,
because everybody ignores sliders.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.601
They're going to look at video
and consider quickly whether they're going

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.819
to play it or not,
and look at other elements

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.261
like accordions or tabs,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.701
sort of like headings.

00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:58.090
They may read them, they may decide
to interact or not with them,

00:12:58.241 --> 00:13:00.700
but very quickly decide these things.

00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:05.200
Kosi, as a native screen reader user,
could you talk us

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.541
through how you approach a webpage?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840
Next slide.

00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Kosi> When I first arrive
at a webpage, the very first thing

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.871
the page is going to alert me
to is the page title.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.161
This gives me my initial clue
about what the page is about.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.440
Sometimes I immediately hear
alerts like modal windows

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.671
or cookie notices asking me
to sign up for something.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.370
I have to address these first
before getting to the rest of the page.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.920
The screen reader then announces document
or page loaded.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.370
That lets me know
that the content is still there.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.170
Okay.

00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:47.350
The screen reader's focus
is automatically placed

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.701
at the top of the page,

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.660
which means if I start to arrow down,
I'm going to experience

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.181
everything sequentially
from top to bottom.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.181
In this next part of the journey,

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.691
I get my bearings
by exploring the structure.

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:08.691
The first thing I typically do
is start using

00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:11.561
my heading navigation keys.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.211
I press the H key.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.342
This gives me
an outline of the page's main sections

00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:19.481
and lets me know how things are organized.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.820
I also navigate by using

00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:25.691
my screen reader's landmarks or regions.

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:30.880
I use R to locate navigation,
regions, main content,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.290
and footer areas.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.080
In the third step,
I take stock of what's on the page.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.359
After understanding the structure,
I then select the keystroke,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.201
which allows me to pull up
my list of links to see where I can go.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.341
I review buttons to see
what actions are available.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.470
I then identify form fields.

00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:57.730
I check for text fields,
check boxes, and drop-downs.

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:01.721
Sometimes I go back and open up
my list of headings.

00:15:01.811 --> 00:15:04.990
It provides a good overview
and outline of the page.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.290
To navigate content,
I use the Tab key to go

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:13.571
through all the interactive elements
in order.

00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:17.289
This helps me understand the flow
and ensure that everything

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.940
is reachable via keyboard.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.471
Now, if the structure is confusing
or I need to understand details,

00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:27.101
I'll use my arrow keys
to navigate line by line,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.290
sometimes even word by word.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.669
My screen reader tells me
what kind of element I'm on,

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.720
whether it's a link,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.210
button, image, or something else.

00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:43.059
I rely heavily on proper labels
for form fields and appropriate alt text

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.880
for images in order
to understand what they are.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.370
Without them, I'm left guessing.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.450
For interaction,

00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:56.381
I use the Enter key
to click links and buttons,

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:01.420
Space bar for check boxes,
and I type directly into edit fields.

00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:03.851
After I perform an action,

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:09.521
I listen for any messages that let me know
if the interaction was successful,

00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:12.160
if there are any errors on the page,

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.621
or if something changed on the page.

00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:18.910
For complex components
like tabs or accordions,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.230
I have to figure out
the specific keyboard commands.

00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:27.641
Sometimes I have to just cross my fingers
and hope that the website is using

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.761
appropriate accessibility standards
and guidelines.

00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:37.241
These are some of the steps I take
in my head as I'm navigating a website,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.290
especially if it's a website
that I am unfamiliar with.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.739
This is a good blueprint,
but I want you to keep

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.740
in mind

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.200
that when you're out in the Wild,
Wild West and you're exploring

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.420
websites, think of the commands
and keystrokes that you learn as tools

00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:56.590
in your toolbox.

00:16:56.921 --> 00:17:00.790
If one command doesn't work,
maybe you try another.

00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:02.771
Sometimes it's trial and error.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.529
As you spend more time
using a screen reader,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.420
you get better at making those judgment
calls when it comes to navigation.

00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.160
As I'm using a screen reader

00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:17.691
on a website, for example,

00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:20.431
these are some questions
that I'm always asking.

00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:24.821
Throughout the process, I'm asking myself,
"What's this page about?

00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:26.471
What are the different parts?

00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:29.080
Where can I go from here?

00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:30.700
What can I do?

00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:33.820
How is the information organized?

00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:36.971
How can I move through interactive parts?

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.791
What information do I need to provide?

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:41.561
What is this image

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.070
showing me?

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.871
Did that click button work?

00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.331
Is this site actually making sense to me?"

00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:53.590
What's the goal of this?

00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:55.480
What am I trying to achieve?

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.461
At the end of the day,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.231
I want to be able to understand
the website's purpose and content,

00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:06.850
understand what my options
for navigating are.

00:18:07.631 --> 00:18:09.010
As I mentioned before,

00:18:09.101 --> 00:18:13.541
I want to be able to create
a mental model of the layout in my head.

00:18:14.381 --> 00:18:16.841
At the end of the day,
just like everyone else,

00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:20.650
I want to be able
to perform tasks effectively.

00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:31.390
Now, I want to talk about themes
that have emerged over my years of working

00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:33.491
and training people
to use a screen reader.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.570
First one,

00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:37.631
structure is key.

00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:42.310
Well-organized content
with proper headings is crucial.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.520
Next, words matter.

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:50.351
Clear labels with good alt text
make a huge difference.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.901
For the next one,

00:18:52.961 --> 00:18:56.980
the ability to operate
with keyboard only is essential

00:18:57.551 --> 00:18:58.551
for someone like me.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.730
The next one,

00:19:02.051 --> 00:19:05.681
response and feedback
after an action, is vital.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.550
For me, usability is directly impacted
by a company deciding to design

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.551
for accessibility.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.180
If a website does not have
accessibility in mind,

00:19:16.661 --> 00:19:20.380
it's very challenging,
if not impossible, for me to use.

00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:23.331
The final one,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.510
solving for accessibility
on issues or finding

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.861
workarounds for inaccessible content,
is constant.

00:19:33.311 --> 00:19:36.011
One thing about someone
that uses a screen reader well,

00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:39.481
they know how to problem-solve
because you're always trying to work,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.320
find your way around some sort
of inaccessible component.

00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:47.861
<v Deneb> Okay.

00:19:47.862 --> 00:19:52.390
Let's get ready to ascend
to the screen reader ropes course.

00:19:52.781 --> 00:19:56.410
Before we do that, let's talk
a little bit of history and context.

00:19:56.621 --> 00:19:57.621
Next slide.

00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:03.250
As far as history goes,
just really briefly,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.050
a history of the screen readers.

00:20:05.051 --> 00:20:07.659
In 1984, the first screen reader came out.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.460
It was called the IBM Screen Reader.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.381
Five years after that,

00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:13.481
Job Access With Speech, JAWS,

00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:15.501
was developed for Windows.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.691
That was the only screen reader there was
available for quite a long time,

00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:20.361
11 years.

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.671
In 2000,

00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:26.013
Narrator came out for Windows 2000,
came included with Windows 2000,

00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.141
so that was your first free screen reader.

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:31.841
Through all of this time, Mac
didn't really have a screen reader

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.450
until 2005 when VoiceOver came out,

00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:36.451
pre-installed with the macOS

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.200
and has been ever since.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.879
The year after that, 2006,
Non-Visual Desktop Access,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.560
or NVDA, was developed
as an open source program for Windows.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.261
Finally, Windows got
a fully functional free screen reader.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.091
Today, Narrator keeps getting better,
but JAWS is still the most popular,

00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:01.666
though it is expensive,
with NVDA as a runner-up.

00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:05.170
VoiceOver
is still Macintosh's only option.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.010
On the mobile side of things,

00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:13.224
mobile devices have had a screen reader
pre-installed since about 2009.

00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:14.751
VoiceOver

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.730
comes on iOS devices
and TalkBack comes on Android,

00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:23.261
so everybody has access
to screen readers, one way or the other.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.239
Screen reader basics and cheat sheets.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.770
To give you just a really, really
high-level overview of how screen readers

00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:35.621
work, the basic navigation
with a screen reader,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.330
you could go element by element.

00:21:38.744 --> 00:21:41.651
To do this with NVDA,
you use the up and the down arrow.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.880
For VoiceOver with the quick nav enabled,
which is what I recommend,

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.671
you use the left and the right arrow keys.

00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:51.580
That's one way to go in screen readers.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.281
You can also navigate by element types.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.879
That's where you just push
a single letter,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.300
and that will jump you either
to the next element of that type,

00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:05.080
or if you do shift and that letter,
it'll go to the previous one of that type

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.560
on the page.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.871
It'll look through the page,
and it'll find the very next element.

00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:10.271
That's header, for example,
if you'd use H.

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:12.731
You can jump around by element type.

00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:15.970
You can also interact with the Tab key,
which will jump you

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.160
to the next interactive element.

00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:22.421
Then you can interact with that element
by using the Enter or the Space key.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:27.656
Those are the high-level ways
of using a screen reader.

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:31.990
You can go through the specific keystrokes
and such on our cheat sheets,

00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:38.239
which we have online at bit.ly/sr-cheats.

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.390
That's for the online cheat sheet.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.091
Or there's also a QR code
on the screen that,

00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.941
if you just point your phone at that,

00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.020
it'll pull up the cheat sheet.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.629
You can look at it on your phone
while you are navigating

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.781
your screen reader
on whatever page you're practicing on.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.710
We think that's pretty helpful
for starters.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.820
Now it is
the moment you've all been waiting for.

00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:04.121
Introducing
the screen reader ropes course.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.740
This ropes course,

00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:07.181
I think, is pretty helpful.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.341
Let me tell you
about some of its features,

00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:10.780
and then I'll tell you how to get there.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.240
First, on the ropes course,
you can activate

00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:17.830
a mini crash course on how to use
the screen reader of your choice.

00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:21.040
It goes
through the very fundamental basics

00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:22.041
pretty quickly.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.744
There's also a way to activate
some built-in cheat sheets,

00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:28.030
so it'll pop up
on the screen so you can look

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.250
at that as you're practicing on this page.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:35.680
There's also a series of 15 tasks
that will help build your experience

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:37.541
with that screen reader,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.710
help you practice and develop some, perhaps some muscle memory

00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:45.640
as well as some comfort
with what it sounds like.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.840
I think just that familiarity
in a safe environment can go a long ways.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.140
Another thing you can activate
with these tasks

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.660
is some on-screen guidance.

00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:59.560
Directly after the task,
there will be instructions,

00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:03.310
or can be instructions if you want them,
for how to perform the task

00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:04.911
on your screen reader of choice.

00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:10.150
You can also leave this off
so you don't tend to practice

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.610
without the guidance.

00:24:12.731 --> 00:24:14.861
Also, on this ropes course,

00:24:15.491 --> 00:24:16.491
there's a timer.

00:24:16.691 --> 00:24:20.350
For those of you who like to compete,
you can check your time,

00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:22.960
see how long it takes you to complete
these 15 tasks,

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.881
or individual ones.

00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:26.361
At the end,

00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:30.220
there's a form that you can fill out,
which will include your score

00:24:30.221 --> 00:24:32.111
and that can go onto a leaderboard.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.579
This leaderboard is a way
to challenge yourself,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.621
challenge other people to see who can get
through this ropes course most quickly

00:24:41.711 --> 00:24:44.111
and also the most time.

00:24:44.471 --> 00:24:45.699
Really, ultimately,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.511
the best way to use the ropes course
is however works for you.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.240
If you want to do the tasks, fantastic.

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.950
If you want to submit the form, great.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.960
If you want to try to get
on that leaderboard,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.190
the top 10 scores, wonderful,
but none of that is necessary.

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:03.761
All that's necessary is
that you have this ropes course

00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:06.041
that you can practice time and time again.

00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:08.395
The way to get there is follow the link

00:25:08.605 --> 00:25:17.539
seamonsterstudios.com/screen-reader-ropes-course.

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:21.701
Additionally, you could just Google
screen reader ropes course,

00:25:21.701 --> 00:25:25.931
and I believe this is the only thing
pretty much that will show up.

00:25:26.054 --> 00:25:28.803
It's hosted here at seamonsterstudios.com.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.450
I hope you enjoy it.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.920
Now, to get
a little more theory, next slide.

00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:38.230
<v Kosi> At the end of the day,
screen reader users

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.661
and visual users may have different paths,
but they have the same goals.

00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:49.449
Both groups of users want to get
information and perform interactions

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.450
successfully.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.811
I would say that the experience
happens on a different plane.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:01.150
One is visual, one is auditory,
but both are valid and important.

00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:05.920
It's important to point out
that varied fluency

00:26:06.341 --> 00:26:10.931
equals vastly different experiences,
even for screen reader users.

00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:16.329
A screen reader power user is going
to navigate very differently

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.411
from a beginner.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.711
There's this saying
in the blind community,

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.701
when you've met one blind person,
you've met one blind person.

00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:28.931
What that essentially means is every user
is different.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.082
In this training,

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:33.491
I'm giving you tips
and tricks and the common themes,

00:26:33.701 --> 00:26:37.750
but the reality
is every screen reader user is different.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.140
There's
no single screen reader user experience.

00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:45.339
There are many individual experiences
shaped by preferences,

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.080
habits, and expertise.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.500
This is just one reason why paired
testing is the best case scenario.

00:26:54.127 --> 00:26:56.979
What I mean by paired testing
is maybe having

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.321
a screen reader user work side
by side with a visual user.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.601
Bringing together visual
and screen reader perspectives can create

00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:09.490
a more complete understanding.

00:27:10.091 --> 00:27:12.911
Again, a variety of pairings is optimal.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.235
Different screen readers,
different levels of expertise,

00:27:16.661 --> 00:27:19.660
and different navigation techniques.

00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:21.951
<v Deneb> On this slide, we have

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:28.720
a little image graphic to represent
this disconnect between visual surfers

00:27:28.721 --> 00:27:29.921
and screen reader users.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.660
This graphic has
an orange circle on the left

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.811
and a purple triangle on the right.

00:27:37.871 --> 00:27:41.741
These two are connected with a black line
that has a squiggle in the middle,

00:27:42.011 --> 00:27:45.221
illustrating the fact
that they're very different experiences,

00:27:45.371 --> 00:27:48.851
and sometimes it's difficult
to work together.

00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:52.241
As you will see in the next slide,
we think it's very much worth

00:27:52.241 --> 00:27:54.490
your while to embrace this disconnect.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:55.850
Next slide.

00:27:57.001 --> 00:28:00.674
What do I mean by embracing
the disconnect?

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.460
Having

00:28:04.744 --> 00:28:09.370
a paired tester who is looking
at things from a different perspective

00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:15.520
than you gives you the chance
to experience the site as a whole.

00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:19.691
Really, to experience it
from a different perspective.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.710
This gives you a chance to hammer out,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.640
between the two of you,
what would be

00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:27.851
the optimal experience for both.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.781
This is a great benefit,

00:28:32.591 --> 00:28:36.010
but the question arises, what happens

00:28:36.521 --> 00:28:39.071
if you don't have
a native screen reader user to test

00:28:39.071 --> 00:28:40.570
the site alongside you?

00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:42.971
That's why you're here.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.809
We hope to give you
some level of proficiency

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.899
or expertise, ideally, for when you don't have somebody to test

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.900
the site with.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.350
On this slide,
we have the same orange circle

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.301
and purple triangle connected
with a squiggly line, but on this slide,

00:28:58.302 --> 00:29:02.591
there's a blue square above them
representing the website.

00:29:03.356 --> 00:29:08.109
This graphic is meant to illustrate
that the two different perspectives

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.641
can be used to get
a fuller understanding of the website.

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:17.710
Our slide titled, How Long Until It 'Clicks'?

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.050
Estimating Learning Time.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.000
Everybody asks, "How long does it take
to get good at this?"

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.700
The real answer is, well,
longer than we often admit,

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:26.351
but it's absolutely worth it.

00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:28.600
You can get started in a couple of hours.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.040
With 10 to 20 hours,

00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:31.191
you'll feel functional,

00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:33.550
but building true fluency,

00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:36.400
being able to handle
a wide range of layouts confidently,

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400
takes more time.

00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:40.480
That's okay. Native screen reader users
develop their skills

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.731
over thousands of hours of daily use.

00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:45.729
Our goal isn't to match that,
but to learn enough to test

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.401
with empathy, accuracy, and clarity.

00:29:49.061 --> 00:29:52.476
I have on the right side
of this slide four graphics.

00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:55.031
They're purple triangles
in various degrees.

00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:58.681
The top one is just
a lightly outlined white triangle.

00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:01.141
It's purple dots around it, though.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.200
The one just below that is
a solid purple line

00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:06.001
around a gray triangle.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.130
The one just below
that is a solid purple border

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.501
of a light purple triangle.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.260
The bottom one is a solid purple triangle.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:20.139
This illustrates you're
moving towards the native functionality

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.021
of the solid purple triangle.

00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:23.101
Next slide.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.951
<v Kosi> At this time,

00:30:25.952 --> 00:30:28.202
I'm going to get
into some screen reader tips.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.040
I sometimes call
these Kosi's Contextualizing Tips.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.751
These are some practical tips to get you
into the screen reader testing mindset,

00:30:37.021 --> 00:30:39.321
even if you're not
a native screen reader user.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.790
First, turn off your screen

00:30:42.331 --> 00:30:44.131
and rely solely on audio.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.829
This forces you to experience the site
as a screen reader user would.

00:30:49.921 --> 00:30:53.011
Next, embrace keyboard-only navigation.

00:30:53.371 --> 00:30:59.130
You're going to put away the mouse
and navigate by using only the Tab keys,

00:30:59.131 --> 00:31:02.580
the arrow keys,
the Enter, and the Space bar.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.060
Work on building a mental map

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.191
using headings and landmarks.

00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:13.200
This is how screen reader users create
spatial understanding of a page.

00:31:13.766 --> 00:31:17.816
It'll be really helpful for you
to understand the difference

00:31:17.996 --> 00:31:20.311
between browse mode
and forms mode.

00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:24.899
These are different interaction states
in screen readers that change the way

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.060
the different keystrokes function.

00:31:27.631 --> 00:31:31.051
Browse mode is going to be used
when you're reading content

00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:33.001
and are gathering information.

00:31:33.271 --> 00:31:37.860
Forms mode is going to be used
when you're interacting with any form

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.070
or edit field,
or just interactive content.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:47.070
It'll be important for you to be patient
with yourself as you learn to build

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.601
a mental model in your head.

00:31:48.923 --> 00:31:52.350
Going to have to practice
mental rehearsal.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.979
Sometimes you might even have
to speak out loud what you're hearing

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.120
with the screen reader.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.790
This is because, as you're learning
to use a screen reader,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.191
it requires more cognitive processing.

00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:04.231
Pay close attention

00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:07.860
to dynamic content and focus management.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.751
How are updates announced?

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.750
Where does focus move after actions?

00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:18.961
Lastly, generally pay attention
to what the screen reader is announcing

00:32:19.152 --> 00:32:22.531
and how different elements are presented.

00:32:25.351 --> 00:32:26.400
On this slide,

00:32:26.551 --> 00:32:30.150
we're going to talk
about common screen reader blockers.

00:32:31.021 --> 00:32:35.101
These are the common barriers
preventing effective access.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.971
Visible content without text alternatives.

00:32:40.111 --> 00:32:44.311
Images and charts without alt text
are invisible to us.

00:32:45.361 --> 00:32:47.881
Functional elements
without keyboard control.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.281
Basically, if I can't tab to it,

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.310
I can't use it.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.100
Excessive or unwieldy content
can sometimes overwhelm,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.311
especially
when it's delivered sequentially.

00:33:00.241 --> 00:33:03.420
The next blocker is navigation barriers.

00:33:04.231 --> 00:33:06.001
Without proper landmarks,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.410
finding content is like searching
for a needle in a haystack.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.761
Additional barriers include
unstructured content.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.831
Without semantic markup,
I'm forced to hear everything linearly.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.241
The next blocker
is inconsistent navigation.

00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:30.240
That forces me to relearn the pattern
and the layout of the page on every page.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.921
Time limits on web pages tend
to be known blockers as well.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.610
Next one.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:41.700
Unexpected actions like a redirect
can really disorient a user,

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.990
especially someone using a screen reader.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.150
The last one is multimedia
without descriptions.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.650
This leaves
critical visual information inaccessible.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.310
In the absence
of a native screen reader tester,

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.150
here's what you need
to keep in mind.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.981
Again, if you're not
a regular screen reader user,

00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:09.180
your experience with a screen reader
is going to be different

00:34:09.181 --> 00:34:10.951
because of your expertise

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.970
and your ability to create
these mental models.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.560
Still, do your best to put yourself

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.860
in the shoes of a native
screen reader user.

00:34:22.981 --> 00:34:27.570
Sometimes, even an imperfect simulation
can be valuable.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.040
Remember, it's better
than not trying at all.

00:34:30.961 --> 00:34:34.291
Some screen reader testing
is vastly better than none.

00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:36.791
For every site you test
for accessibility,

00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:39.432
you should test with at least
one screen reader.

00:34:39.432 --> 00:34:41.788
Remember, this is a non-negotiable.

00:34:42.241 --> 00:34:43.241
Ideally,

00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:44.581
in a perfect world,

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.700
you should test with two screen readers.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.761
Sometimes, different screen readers
can behave differently,

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.200
even with the same content.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.850
Even with thorough testing,
it's important to remember

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.931
that it's still not
the full picture, and that's okay.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.041
Accessibility is
a journey of continuous improvement,

00:35:05.191 --> 00:35:06.780
not a one-time achievement.

00:35:09.061 --> 00:35:12.451
As you're navigating
with a screen reader and listening

00:35:13.141 --> 00:35:14.141
to the output,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.251
you should hear
three key pieces of information.

00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:19.231
Number one: role.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.731
What is the element?

00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:24.661
Is it a button, a heading, a link,
or something else?

00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:27.789
Number two: name/label.

00:35:28.621 --> 00:35:30.000
What is its purpose?

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.570
Does it have a clear label
like search or continue?

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.570
Number three: state.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.099
What condition is it in?

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.991
Is it selected, checked, disabled,
or another state?

00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:46.651
If you're hearing
all three when appropriate,

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.411
the element is likely coded accessibly.

00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:57.270
Now, let me give you examples
of what appropriate screen reader output

00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:58.271
should sound like.

00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:01.921
What better way than to actually hear
a screen reader?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.380
<v SCREEN READER> For headings,
heading Level 1,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.380
Welcome.

00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:08.071
For links, link, Contact Us.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.770
For buttons, button, Add to Cart.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:14.070
For images, graphic,
woman walking with cane.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.364
For check boxes, check box,
subscribe to newsletter,

00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:18.667
not checked.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.081
For tabs, Tab, Details, Selected.

00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.620
For drop-downs, combo box,
Choose a Country,

00:36:25.836 --> 00:36:26.836
United States.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.580
For dialogues, dialogue,
"Are you sure you want

00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.999
to delete this item, apostrophe?"

00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.470
For table cells, Row 2, Column 1, Monday.

00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Kosi> Now, let's look at warning signs
that indicate accessibility problems.

00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:50.911
If you hear the following,
the element might be inaccessible.

00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:55.231
You're out there looking
at websites in the wild.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.311
If you hear something like,
"Link with no label,"

00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:03.810
that is going to indicate
empty or no link text.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.990
Say if you're on a site and you hear,
"Heading Level 2, blank."

00:37:08.688 --> 00:37:11.880
That means there's
no heading content,

00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:14.221
or it's an improperly styled heading.

00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:20.700
You get to an image, and it just says,
"Graphic," with no additional information.

00:37:21.181 --> 00:37:24.810
That signals an image
missing its alt attribute.

00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:28.545
A button with no name means
that there's a missing label

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:29.856
or aria-label.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.440
What if you get to a form field
and there's no context?

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:41.160
That could indicate that there is
no label or aria-ledby [aria-labelledby] being used.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.410
Say if you get to a toggle state
and you get no feedback

00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:48.630
after you have selected the toggle.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.255
This suggests missing aria-pressed,
aria-expanded,

00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:55.111
or similar attributes.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.571
Silent interactions where you expect
feedback but hear nothing usually means

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.490
missing roles or states.

00:38:02.971 --> 00:38:06.541
Remember that wording may vary among
the different screen readers,

00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:08.701
but essential information—

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.150
role, name, state—should always be present.

00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:20.580
Now it's time to talk
about going beyond keystrokes or cheat

00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:24.000
sheets and building
actual screen reader fluency.

00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:27.631
The keystrokes are just
the starting point.

00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:31.261
These cheat sheets are a great tool
to have in your toolbox,

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:36.001
but learning to test
with a screen reader goes beyond that.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.130
Becoming fluent with your screen reader
goes beyond memorization.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:46.860
You need to build an instinct
for when and how to use each command.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.310
For example,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.531
jumping by heading is great
if the page is properly structured.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.740
If it's not,

00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:59.730
you may need to fall back to reading
line by line or even using tab navigation

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.281
to find interactive elements.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:08.130
Fluency means knowing how to switch
strategies based on what you encounter,

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.091
just like a sighted tester
uses their eyes to scan.

00:39:12.721 --> 00:39:15.870
I'm going to leave you with a quote
to reinforce this concept.

00:39:16.831 --> 00:39:19.290
"It's not just about knowing
what key to press.

00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:23.550
It's about choosing the right key
at the right time in the right context."

00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:26.641
This, I feel, really sums up our approach.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.430
It's not about memorizing shortcuts.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.660
It's about developing a flexible,
responsive mindset.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.661
You're learning to navigate dynamically
based on what's on the page,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.110
what your testing goals are,
and what information the screen reader

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.110
is giving you.

00:39:45.031 --> 00:39:46.261
What's our ask here?

00:39:46.741 --> 00:39:48.091
What is our call to action?

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.081
We would like you to use
our screen reader course to develop

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.791
fluency through practice.

00:39:54.061 --> 00:39:56.111
The ropes course is a great way to start.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.250
It walks you through tasks
using a screen reader.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.781
Not just learning commands,
but you're also applying them.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.970
Use the cheat sheets to help you stay

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.090
oriented, but don't worry
about memorization,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.685
at least not up front.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.131
You'll start to recognize
patterns the more you practice.

00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.130
The most important thing is don't wait.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:19.479
Jump in.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.560
Make mistakes.

00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:21.700
Listen closely

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.921
and learn to trust your instincts.

00:40:24.494 --> 00:40:27.700
Screen reader testing is
a skill, and like any skill,

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.031
fluency comes with time, exposure,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.090
and practice.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.571
I just want to remind everybody to go
to the appendix of the presentation

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.610
and check out some of our resources.

00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:40.691
We have a lot there,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.001
and we think that you'll find it
to be helpful.

00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:46.330
This concludes our presentation
on the introduction

00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:47.710
to the screen reader ropes course.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.710
Thank you so much.

00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:56.015
<v Deneb> Yes.

00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.285
<v Sherose> Awesome, awesome.

00:40:57.305 --> 00:41:00.142
Thank you for the presentation,
Deneb and Kosi.

00:41:00.262 --> 00:41:01.406
Are we both here to speak?

00:41:01.427 --> 00:41:02.448
Excellent.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.015
We have a few minutes for questions.

00:41:05.036 --> 00:41:08.258
I want to try to address everything,
so I may combine questions.

00:41:08.304 --> 00:41:10.012
First thing I want to say,

00:41:10.127 --> 00:41:12.834
there is a lot happening in the chat.

00:41:12.978 --> 00:41:17.461
Deneb, you've shared many links
to resources and references.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.887
Can users find this on the slides?

00:41:19.907 --> 00:41:21.178
<v Deneb> Yes.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.785
If they pull up the PDF version
that we sent in,

00:41:26.807 --> 00:41:28.287
I sent it in under duress.

00:41:28.307 --> 00:41:31.352
Really, the way that
I'd like for you all to access

00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:35.034
this is through the HTML version.

00:41:35.132 --> 00:41:36.588
I've posted the link several times.

00:41:36.609 --> 00:41:37.702
I'll do it again.

00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:45.168
That has the very most
up-to-date version of our slide deck.

00:41:45.189 --> 00:41:48.339
<v title="Sherose">&nbsp;[crosstalk] Excellent.
<v title="Deneb"> The most accessible as well.

00:41:48.452 --> 00:41:50.205
<v title="Sherose">&nbsp;Semantic HTML, of course.

00:41:50.226 --> 00:41:52.216
<v title="Deneb"> Yes.
<v title="Sherose"> The next question,

00:41:52.236 --> 00:41:53.239
just really quick.

00:41:53.259 --> 00:41:57.002
What can someone expect to do
in the ropes course?

00:41:59.569 --> 00:42:01.321
<v Deneb> You'll come
to the ropes course.

00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:04.951
There will be a section of setup
where you decide

00:42:05.007 --> 00:42:09.232
if you want the additional tips
along with the tasks.

00:42:09.253 --> 00:42:12.706
We've actually eliminated the pop-up

00:42:12.746 --> 00:42:17.645
that had the cheat sheets
right there in the ropes course,

00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:19.496
but we do have a link

00:42:19.513 --> 00:42:22.651
that you can pull it up
on a separate device or something.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
And then there will be those...

00:42:26.228 --> 00:42:33.215
There will be an option
for a quick crash course, I suppose,

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:37.726
on whichever screen reader
you're using.

00:42:38.075 --> 00:42:42.696
Then, below that, there are these 15 tasks
that you go through a demo web page

00:42:42.716 --> 00:42:46.426
that I put together that has
all the different types of elements.

00:42:46.817 --> 00:42:52.013
You just use your screen reader
to go through and do all those tasks,

00:42:52.034 --> 00:42:54.091
and it times you

00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:57.090
so you can track your own progress
and how you're doing.

00:42:57.369 --> 00:42:59.046
<v Sherose> I took a quick peek.

00:42:59.067 --> 00:43:01.209
I like that it uses plain language.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.741
It's also well spaced out.

00:43:04.068 --> 00:43:05.102
It's self-paced,

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:09.215
which I personally appreciate
the accessibility that affords.

00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:11.209
I am sure others do as well.

00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.488
<v title="Deneb"> [crosstalk] Sure.
<v title="Sherose"> Kosi,

00:43:12.509 --> 00:43:15.058
we have a question
specifically for you.

00:43:15.168 --> 00:43:21.133
Do you have a ballpark estimate
of the percentage of times

00:43:21.197 --> 00:43:24.577
you need to ask for help
in completing a task on a website

00:43:24.598 --> 00:43:27.049
because it was inaccessible?

00:43:27.706 --> 00:43:29.214
<v Kosi> Oh, wow.

00:43:29.985 --> 00:43:31.134
That's a great question.

00:43:31.154 --> 00:43:34.128
I would say

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:39.881
the times I'm asking for help, now,

00:43:40.544 --> 00:43:46.632
mind you, I like to attempt to see
if there is a workaround first.

00:43:47.383 --> 00:43:50.742
That may take more of my time.

00:43:50.803 --> 00:43:54.649
I think maybe 30% of the time,

00:43:54.812 --> 00:43:56.848
I have to reach out and ask

00:43:56.925 --> 00:44:03.515
for help or get some sighted help.

00:44:03.536 --> 00:44:06.031
Usually, with a screen reader,

00:44:10.988 --> 00:44:12.968
there might be some way to do it.

00:44:12.988 --> 00:44:15.031
It might be inconvenient.

00:44:15.282 --> 00:44:22.140
I try to see if I can find a new way,
but it takes a lot of my time.

00:44:22.403 --> 00:44:23.223
<v Sherose> It takes a lot of time.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:25.610
A third of your time
is a lot of your time.

00:44:25.631 --> 00:44:26.800
I imagine,

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.331
in some cases, you might choose not
to continue on with the website.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.984
<v Kosi> Exactly.
If it's going to be a lot of work,

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:34.014
I'm going to skip it.

00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:36.729
I'll try it for like 10 minutes.

00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:40.008
If I find that
it's not really worth that,

00:44:40.029 --> 00:44:46.554
I'm going to go somewhere else
with my money,

00:44:46.575 --> 00:44:48.641
say if I'm trying to buy something.

00:44:48.662 --> 00:44:51.689
<v Sherose> Okay.
That makes so much sense, literally.

00:44:53.565 --> 00:44:54.543
We have time.

00:44:54.563 --> 00:44:57.256
I want to say we have time
for maybe one more question.

00:44:57.277 --> 00:44:58.814
I'm going to combine two.

00:44:58.834 --> 00:45:01.450
This is about JAWS and NVDA.

00:45:01.502 --> 00:45:06.739
One person says that JAWS
can be pretty expensive for a freelancer.

00:45:06.824 --> 00:45:09.738
Is NVDA the next best substitute,

00:45:09.765 --> 00:45:13.246
or has the next,
maybe the closest behavior?

00:45:13.307 --> 00:45:15.116
The next question actually asks,

00:45:15.136 --> 00:45:18.097
what are the main differences
between JAWS and NVDA

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.500
in terms of
how it interprets web content?

00:45:21.821 --> 00:45:25.547
Do you notice any code error?

00:45:25.568 --> 00:45:26.647
Let me rephrase.

00:45:26.687 --> 00:45:29.073
Sometimes, when testing
with both of these screen readers,

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:32.916
one screen reader will read certain
elements more successfully than others.

00:45:32.936 --> 00:45:36.376
What are the typical code errors
that play into this?

00:45:37.606 --> 00:45:38.716
<v Kosi> Great.

00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:43.159
I would say a couple of things.

00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:46.686
I wouldn't say that NVDA
is the next best thing.

00:45:46.706 --> 00:45:52.470
I would say that NVDA is probably
the best screen reader to test with,

00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:58.544
because with JAWS, it can be helpful,

00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:03.524
but they inject things

00:46:07.009 --> 00:46:08.879
in the background.

00:46:10.193 --> 00:46:13.478
Even if a web page may not have
the right code,

00:46:13.576 --> 00:46:15.886
JAWS is going to try to read

00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:22.662
things in a way
that will be helpful to the user.

00:46:23.095 --> 00:46:25.083
As far as testing goes,

00:46:25.197 --> 00:46:29.627
it's probably better
to test with NVDA first.

00:46:29.694 --> 00:46:33.400
I'm not saying don't test with JAWS
because users still use JAWS,

00:46:33.447 --> 00:46:36.204
but NVDA is cleaner.

00:46:37.468 --> 00:46:41.645
It's going to be reading to you.

00:46:41.827 --> 00:46:44.267
It's not reading the page.

00:46:44.287 --> 00:46:49.549
It's reading from the DOM,
pretty much.

00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:53.552
I don't know
if I answered all of the questions.

00:46:54.384 --> 00:46:55.765
The differences.

00:46:57.868 --> 00:47:02.626
There's a lot of similarities,

00:47:02.873 --> 00:47:12.999
but it's pretty much what I said. 
JAWS is going to inject things into the...

00:47:13.415 --> 00:47:17.625
You're going to have a difference
in the output

00:47:17.645 --> 00:47:19.175
because JAWS is trying to

00:47:21.045 --> 00:47:27.797
help you read
and make sense of things,

00:47:27.817 --> 00:47:30.658
even if the code isn't there.

00:47:31.023 --> 00:47:32.623
<v Sherose> Okay, I think
I understand what you're saying.

00:47:32.643 --> 00:47:34.242
You're saying that
while both are useful,

00:47:34.262 --> 00:47:36.971
both are commonly used as well
for testing.

00:47:36.982 --> 00:47:43.154
NVDA might be more literal,
whereas JAWS is more likely to add things

00:47:43.174 --> 00:47:45.683
that aren't there,
thereby not giving you really

00:47:45.704 --> 00:47:48.244
an accurate read of the page. 
<v Kosi> Correct.

00:47:48.251 --> 00:47:53.325
<v Sherose> Right. Can I ask you,
Kosi, do you find a significant difference

00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:57.042
if you're using a different browser,
like Chrome versus Firefox?

00:47:59.069 --> 00:48:00.223
<v Kosi> Sometimes.

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.986
Sometimes,

00:48:02.693 --> 00:48:06.211
if things don't work in Chrome,
I might try it in Firefox,

00:48:06.231 --> 00:48:08.473
or if things aren't working in Edge,

00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:13.748
sometimes you have to mix and match.

00:48:16.824 --> 00:48:23.088
It's best to probably test in Chrome
and on Edge with both NVDA and JAWS.

00:48:23.881 --> 00:48:28.480
Sometimes when things
don't work well on a website,

00:48:28.704 --> 00:48:35.302
I find that
if I switch over to Firefox,

00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:36.792
it might work better there.

00:48:37.348 --> 00:48:41.653
It's really important to test
with multiple screen readers

00:48:41.673 --> 00:48:46.670
and multiple browsers as well.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.296
<v Sherose> What I'm hearing from you is,

00:48:49.415 --> 00:48:51.318
maybe the first round
of screen reader testing

00:48:51.338 --> 00:48:54.734
you would recommend is NVDA
in a Chrome browser.

00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:55.445
<v Kosi> Correct.

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.833
<v Sherose> Right,
and then go from there.

00:48:56.853 --> 00:48:59.976
Okay, I think we could squeeze
one more thing in.

00:49:00.058 --> 00:49:04.267
Can most of the things required to make
a screen reader work correctly be done

00:49:04.287 --> 00:49:07.389
without coding on a WordPress site?

00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:09.730
I'm going to guess that's a no.

00:49:09.957 --> 00:49:12.495
If you're working with WordPress
as part of a CMS,

00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:16.367
where you only have front-end access,
the semantic HTML is already there.

00:49:16.543 --> 00:49:17.850
If not,

00:49:17.937 --> 00:49:19.003
you're coding that.

00:49:19.024 --> 00:49:20.386
Is that right?

00:49:21.275 --> 00:49:23.263
<v Kosi> I'm going to hand that to you,

00:49:23.284 --> 00:49:24.284
Deneb.

00:49:25.473 --> 00:49:27.302
<v Deneb> I would say,
for the most part,

00:49:27.322 --> 00:49:29.627
WordPress has done a pretty good job

00:49:29.947 --> 00:49:33.607
trying to make all of
their code accessible,

00:49:33.628 --> 00:49:36.986
so I'd say for the most part,
that's true.

00:49:42.476 --> 00:49:44.193
It's so dependent upon

00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:49.856
if you're using a site builder
or if you're using just

00:49:49.882 --> 00:49:52.692
the standard blocks and stuff.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.566
If you can add the ARIA attributes,

00:49:56.586 --> 00:49:59.891
that might be helpful
or necessary in some cases.

00:49:59.912 --> 00:50:02.365
<v Sherose> Yes, so it is situational.

00:50:02.455 --> 00:50:03.588
Okay, thank you all so much.

00:50:03.608 --> 00:50:07.008
We are out of time, and I see that
the chat is still popping,

00:50:07.028 --> 00:50:08.922
so people will likely be looking

00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:10.945
at this presentation later as well.

00:50:12.996 --> 00:50:15.433
<v Deneb> I was just going to say,
definitely contact us.

00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:18.489
<v title="Sherose"> Yes.
<v title="Deneb"> If you have more questions,

00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:21.168
I posted it in the chat.

00:50:21.522 --> 00:50:23.632
<v Sherose> It's available on the slides as well.

00:50:24.102 --> 00:50:27.256
<v Deneb> It's on the slides,
it's in the presentation, so definitely,

00:50:27.277 --> 00:50:28.744
let us know your questions.

00:50:28.745 --> 00:50:30.587
And go to that ropes course

00:50:30.608 --> 00:50:33.606
and fill out the survey at the end--

00:50:33.627 --> 00:50:34.124
<v OPERATOR> [crosstalk] Thank you.

00:50:34.144 --> 00:50:36.451
<v title="Operator"> We're going to need to cut you off there  
<v title="Deneb"> [crosstalk] and we'll respond to it there, too.

00:50:36.472 --> 00:50:37.997
<v title="Operator"> for our ASL interpreters.

00:50:38.018 --> 00:50:41.443
Thank you, everyone, for joining,
and we'll see you in the next session.

00:50:41.547 --> 00:50:42.397
<v Sherose> Bye, everyone.

00:50:42.417 --> 00:50:43.213
<v Kosi> Thanks so much.
