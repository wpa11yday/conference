<v Victoria Ottah> Hello, everyone.

00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.182
I hope you're all in.

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:01.301
I am Victoria Ottah.

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:06.793
I am a UX designer,
and I am an accessibility advocate.

00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:11.269
I am also building
an accessibility community in Nigeria,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.030
Accessibility Nigeria, and we are trying
to bridge the gap between people

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:19.021
with disability
and digital products, including

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.881
open source projects.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.839
I have two illustrations.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.839
Imagine these scenarios.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.093
Scenario 1.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
A young lady,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.237
let's call her Ada.

00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:34.051
Ada is on her way back from work,

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:42.301
and she comes across a restaurant
carrying out a marketing or a publicity

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.207
for their new kitchen,
for their new restaurant.

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:50.280
They hand her a flyer,
and they say, "Please check us out.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.723
Our food is sumptuous,
our food, you'd love it."

00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:58.477
Ada agrees.

00:03:58.478 --> 00:04:01.501
She collects the flyer
from their hand, and she goes home.

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:04.200
One day, she's hungry,

00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:07.225
and she remembers, "Oh, there's a flyer
I got from a new restaurant.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.031
I would love
to try out this new restaurant."

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.838
She checks out the flyer.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.770
The colors are popping.

00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:15.101
Interesting.

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:19.503
The food imagery used,
very beautiful, enticing.

00:04:19.504 --> 00:04:22.861
It's making her feel hungry,
and she has decided,

00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:24.196
"I want to order."

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:29.100
Now, Ada is looking
for the contact details of this restaurant

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.801
to place the order,
but she's unable to find it.

00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:37.620
Let us add that Ada is someone
with visual impairments,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.091
so she has low vision.

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.617
She searches and searches,
but she cannot find the contact details.

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.706
Not because the contact details
are not in the flyer,

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:50.671
but because first,
they are in a crowded background.

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.797
The text is painted.

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:58.290
The font is painted,
and it is written in a small text.

00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:00.739
Now, imagine Ada's frustration.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.363
That's Scenario 1.

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:04.484
Scenario 2.

00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:10.522
Imagine a little boy
is taken to a shopping mall

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.950
to pick out clothings.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.430
The shopping mall is a mall for children,

00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.400
and he's taken by his guardian
to pick out clothing.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:27.408
At the entrance of the shopping mall
is a big banner where the brand

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.250
is advertising their clothes line

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480
for children.

00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:36.090
Obi sees beautiful faces of children
just like him,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.450
about his age,

00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:39.301
different races,

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.771
different gender,

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:42.990
but something is missing.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.929
He doesn't see anybody like him.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.671
Why?

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:49.610
Obi is a child who uses a wheelchair.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.691
He looks at the poster.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.010
There isn't anybody that has
a disability like him.

00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:58.831
His spirit is down.
Obi feels sad.

00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:02.461
He feels like he's not included,
and he hurts.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.010
With these two illustrations in mind,

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:08.436
I would love to introduce
my topic for today,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.341
Invisible Until It Hurts;

00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:15.235
Rethinking Brand Design
Through the Lens of Accessibility.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.041
Accessibility does not limit creativity,
unlike the popular thoughts of people.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.550
People think,

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:34.620
"If my design is accessible,
I'll not be able to explore

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.229
my creativity."
This is wrong.

00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:41.428
Accessibility does not limit creativity.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.550
Rather, accessibility in design
ensures that all people,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.021
especially those with disabilities,
can perceive,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.276
understand, and navigate,
even interact with design.

00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:04.090
These disabilities can present
themselves in different formats.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.530
It can be visual disabilities
like low vision

00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:09.527
or color blindness.

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:12.469
It could be auditory disabilities
like hearing loss,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.371
and people who are deaf completely.

00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:19.211
It could be cognitive disabilities
like dyslexia, ADHD.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.721
It could be motor disabilities
where the user is a wheelchair user

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.881
or an amputee, or someone
with Parkinson's disease

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.472
or other motor disabilities.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.645
Now, that's our topic for today.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.311
Brand design is

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:43.830
a visual and sensory system
that communicates who a brand is

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.541
and what it represents.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.688
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.340
Sensory system is not just visual.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.061
I hope I get to correct the notion today
that brand design is just visual.

00:07:57.511 --> 00:08:02.641
Because a brand should be able
to communicate what they stand for,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.007
not just visually.

00:08:04.008 --> 00:08:08.788
People should also be able to perceive
what a brand represents,

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:14.443
either through hearing them
or feeling what they have to offer.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.282
Brand design gives a brand
its voice and its personality.

00:08:22.394 --> 00:08:26.251
Now, when accessibility comes in,
it ensures that that voice

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.291
that is communicated is heard,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.131
understood, and be able to be used

00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:34.127
by everyone.

00:08:34.698 --> 00:08:38.216
When brand design
and accessibility come together,

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.997
it forms an accessible brand design.

00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:48.049
A brand is experienced mainly visually
through colors,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.110
logo, fonts, imagery, and layout.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.431
It can also be experienced
through the brand's voice and tone.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.698
These are the building blocks
that make up a brand design.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.328
This means that for a brand
to be accessible,

00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.168
a brand needs to have
accessible brand assets.

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.531
What are we going to learn
in today's discussion?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.191
In the course of this talk,
we'll be able to one,

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.831
know how to spot accessibility issues.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.181
Two, know how to fix
this accessibility issue spotted.

00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.963
Three, learn the effects of these issues
on people with disabilities.

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:34.410
Four, learn about the challenges
that brand designers encounter

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.123
in brand design when trying
to implement accessibility.

00:09:38.492 --> 00:09:39.492
Finally,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.661
learn how brands and users
benefit from brand accessibility.

00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.680
Now, let us begin
with accessibility in typography.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.700
When accessibility
in typography is mentioned,

00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:59.003
we're talking about the creation of fonts
and also the usage of fonts.

00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:05.310
It can be used via its weight,
its style, or its size.

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.004
That means it can be light or bold.

00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:11.850
It can be Serif, Sans Serif,
or decorative,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.801
or it can be large or small.

00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:18.781
The ability to implement
these features properly,

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:24.080
including people with disability,
paves way for accessibility in typography.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.146
Now, let us learn about how to spot
some of the accessibility issues

00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:32.430
in typography and how to fix them.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.270
The first one is the text being too small.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.270
Sometimes, the text in a brand can be
less than 14 to 16 pixels for the body,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.801
and this is not accessible.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.091
This makes the bodies illegible
for people to read,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.221
especially people who have
visual impairments like low vision,

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:57.990
hypermetropia, myopia,
people who need glasses

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.654
to read things that are far away.
It can be very difficult for them as well.

00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:06.167
Now, how do we fix these issues?

00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:13.981
Using accessible fonts
that are 16 pixels and above for the body

00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:18.107
and making them scalable
will fix this typography issue.

00:11:19.274 --> 00:11:22.711
Fonts are overly stylized,
condensed, or compressed.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.301
When a wrong style of font
is used for a body

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:32.759
in a way, and it is adjusted in a way,
either stretched or compressed in a way

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.301
that fits a designer's aesthetic,
instead of making it usable,

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.885
this can be an accessibility issue
in typography.

00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:42.270
How do we fix this issue?

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.181
Avoid decorative fonts for the body.

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:51.631
Instead, choose legible typefaces
with open letter forms.

00:11:53.491 --> 00:11:57.630
Another issue is low contrast
between text and background.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:04.111
Example, using light gray types
on a white background and vice versa.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.809
This can be a problem for users
who have visual impairments or users

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.377
who are colorblind.

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:20.280
To fix this issue, designers
must meet the WCA guideline

00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:22.711
for the contrast AA minimum,

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:29.341
which states that text should be 4.5
is to 1 ratio for text,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.064
and 7.1 is to 1 ratio
for the bold text or headings.

00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:42.180
Finally, for typographical issues,
information shown only using color.

00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:46.217
When information or important emphases
are made using only color,

00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:51.587
for instance, links used
as blue without underlining,

00:12:52.081 --> 00:12:55.471
this can be confusing for users
who have learning disability

00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:58.050
or visual impairment.

00:12:58.441 --> 00:12:59.640
How do we fix this?

00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:01.665
Differentiate between links.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.967
Differentiate links with more than color.

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:09.390
We can underline or use, or embolden them.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.971
Also, use headings,

00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:17.475
bullet points, and spacings
for easier scanning of text.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.169
This picture illustration on the screen
is a perfect example of a type

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:32.911
of accessibility issue in typography,
like bad kerning or compressing of text,

00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:35.101
bad spacing of text.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:42.560
On the screen, the words furnace
and kernel are written down in Serif

00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:43.961
and Sans Serif forms.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.210
Because of the bad spacing
and compression,

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:51.920
this word can be misread
as furmace and kermel,

00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:54.497
which can be an accessibility issue
in typography,

00:13:54.498 --> 00:13:58.759
which leads to wrong information
being communicated.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.111
This can also pose a problem for users
who either have learning disability

00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:06.337
or visual impairments.

00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:10.890
In iconography and imagery,

00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:14.640
when we talk about accessibility
in iconography and imagery,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.091
we're talking
about the familiarity of the icon sets,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.127
the illustrations to the users,
the ability to adapt

00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:27.241
these icon sets

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.710
in physical forms
by adding texture, example,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.154
the traffic signpost,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.778
or the diversity and inclusion
that's implemented

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.567
while creating this text.

00:14:42.104 --> 00:14:47.039
Considering people with disabilities,
foreigners who are new to your imagery

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.507
or your icons, and next billion users
who are new to the internet in general.

00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:58.530
Now, let us talk about some of the issues
that can be seen in iconography

00:14:58.531 --> 00:14:59.531
and imagery.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.574
One of them is icons without labels

00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:05.611
that leave the interpretation up
to the user.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.290
Imagine a user who is new
to the internet, and he sees an icon

00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:14.090
that he has never seen before,
and that icon has no labels at all.

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:17.828
Now, they are left to interpret
that icon on their own.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.587
Without having
any prior knowledge to this,

00:15:20.588 --> 00:15:24.030
it can be very difficult for them to get
whatever information you're trying

00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.921
to communicate with that icon.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.678
How do you fix these issues?

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.541
Add labels or tooltips
to your icons for critical action.

00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:40.337
Overly abstract icons
not recognized globally.

00:15:41.538 --> 00:15:46.427
Some countries have icons
that are specifically for their region.

00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:54.458
Imagine using an icon or imagery
that is not recognizable

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:58.861
to someone or a foreigner
who comes into a country

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.165
and has not seen an icon before.

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:03.870
This is going
to be very difficult for them

00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:06.720
to understand
whatever information you're trying

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.810
to push, or whatever information
you're trying

00:16:09.822 --> 00:16:13.143
to communicate using your icon.

00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:14.551
How do you fix this?

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.760
Use globally recognizable icons.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.789
For example, everybody knows
that magnifying glass means search.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.405
Another issue is low contrast

00:16:27.406 --> 00:16:30.385
or thin line icons that blur
when they're small.

00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:34.434
How do you fix this issue?

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.031
Test your icons
as small sizes for clarity,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.705
and make sure they are scalable.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.896
Using pixel sizes from 16 to 24.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.713
Another issue, absence of
disability-inclusive and accessible icons,

00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:55.051
illustrations, and pictures
in visual displays.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.112
When you want to design
a poster for publicity,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.042
do you incorporate people
with disabilities in any imagery

00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:06.173
or pictures?

00:17:06.773 --> 00:17:10.492
Absence of these
is inaccessibility in imagery.

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:12.840
How do you fix this?

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.669
Add accessible icons, illustrations,
and disability-inclusive photos

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.760
in your brand styles.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.640
This picture on the screen is
the perfect example of inclusion.

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:30.541
This is a poster,
a publicity poster of Nike

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:33.660
for their disability inclusion promotion.

00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:40.381
In this image, you see
that people of different gender, races,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.441
and ability are included
in this promotion.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.477
Nobody is going to feel excluded.

00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:50.101
This targets and reaches
the heart of everybody in the process.

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:53.851
We can adopt this method and include

00:17:54.661 --> 00:18:00.331
pictures that are accommodating
of people of different gender,

00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:02.271
races, and abilities.

00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:06.893
Now, let's talk
about accessibility in layouts.

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:09.481
When we talk
about accessibility in layouts,

00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:13.051
we're talking
about the grid system, the spacing,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.310
and the hierarchy flow.

00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.791
For the grid system,

00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:19.499
for a grid system
to be accessible, it should have

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.291
proper alignment of elements
in the design,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.570
and proper grid system that is used
for varying formats: presentation,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.850
like the web, posters,
or presentation slides.

00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:36.377
For spacing, make sure
that there's consistent spacing

00:18:36.378 --> 00:18:41.041
to improve clarity, legibility,
and overall polish of a design.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.497
Make sure that the background
is not crammed and the information

00:18:45.498 --> 00:18:47.940
is not lost because of bad spacing.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.641
Hierarchy flow, using size,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:56.221
weight, and position, even color,
to ensure that content is prioritized

00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:57.251
and emphasized.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:04.230
Not using only color or only weight,
and properly structuring the hierarchy

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.182
so that people can understand
the information that is being sent out.

00:19:08.992 --> 00:19:13.621
What are some of the issues
that can be found in layouts in a design?

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:19.980
Dense or poor spacing that overwhelm
users with cognitive disability.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.021
When the background is too saturated
with so much information

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.781
that an important information,
like the example we started with,

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:36.301
contact details, is being lost
in so many elements on a background,

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.713
this can be an issue.
How do you fix this?

00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:45.209
Use wide spacing to create breathing room
and clear grouping so that people

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:49.249
can be able to find information
that they're looking for in your design.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.760
Another issue is fixed layouts
that do not resize or reflow,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.173
or reflow well on different devices.
How do we fix this?

00:20:01.174 --> 00:20:05.641
Make your layouts responsive
and test at different zoom levels,

00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:08.874
up to 200% zooming.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.627
Another issue is navigation that breaks
for the keyboard and screen users.

00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:18.751
Whenever you're designing
as a brand designer,

00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:21.211
never assume that you do not have

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.080
users with a disability
that are using your product.

00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:29.575
You can have users who have
visual disabilities and use screen readers

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.760
to access information
that you are designing.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.651
To fix this issue,

00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:38.340
keep your navigations consistent
and predictable.

00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:42.929
Structure with semantic HTML
so that the assistive technology

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.576
will be able to recognize
and follow the right reading slope.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.320
Ensure that your layouts
are responsive, they are zoom-friendly,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.655
and they are keyboard accessible.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.525
Now we have the brand voice and the logo.

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:04.710
When we're talking about the brand voice,
we're talking about your language style

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:05.970
and your vocabulary,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.090
the tone which you're using
to communicate information,

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.220
and the ability to adapt.

00:21:11.221 --> 00:21:16.560
For the language style and vocabulary,
for it to be accessible in a brand voice,

00:21:16.921 --> 00:21:21.472
you should use familiar phrases and words
that communicate a brand's value.

00:21:22.591 --> 00:21:27.961
Do not be too abstract and end up
giving off confusing information.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.998
This can be problematic for users
who have cognitive disabilities.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.960
For your tone, use

00:21:36.121 --> 00:21:41.552
proper flexibility across situations,
whether it is formal,

00:21:41.553 --> 00:21:45.511
informal, or playful.
Make sure it is consistent.

00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:49.921
Your voice should be able
to adapt to different platforms.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.951
Example, is it a physical print?

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.951
Are you putting it out on social media?

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.411
Is it going to be
in the form of video animation?

00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:00.331
Is it going to be a document?

00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:05.064
Whatever format at all it's going to take,
you should be able to adapt.

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:08.131
Here are some of the issues

00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:13.830
in brand voices and for the logo
in a brand design.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.470
Overly complex language,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.130
jargon,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.151
or exclusion, or words that exclude
people with disabilities.

00:22:25.313 --> 00:22:26.761
How do you fix this?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.861
Make sure you use plain,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.171
simple, and inclusive languages
in your brand communication.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.041
Remember that users of varying
abilities are accessing your designs.

00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:45.511
Users who have cognitive disabilities
might come across your designs as well,

00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:49.950
so make sure your brand voice
does not confuse.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.400
It is simple and straight to the point.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.561
Another issue we have
is lack of accessible documentation,

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:59.550
like inaccessible brand usage guidelines.

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:00.750
How do you fix this?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.779
Provide accessible files in PDF
and HTML formats with proper tagging,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.894
so that blind users or users
with visual impairments

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.710
or cognitive disability who are making
use of assistive technology

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:20.734
like screen readers will be able to access
the information that you communicate.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.501
Another issue, no guidance
for inclusive language

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.020
or alternative text in marketing.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.601
How do you resolve this?

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.802
Train your team on inclusive writing

00:23:33.803 --> 00:23:38.250
and alternative
text to test best practices.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.541
They should be able to properly label,
properly put description,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:53.480
and use the right inclusive writing style
to include people with disabilities.

00:23:54.331 --> 00:23:58.482
Finally, on brand voice and logo,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:05.160
overly intricate logos that break down
as small sizes and become illegible

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.640
when they are sized.
How do you fix this issue?

00:24:09.301 --> 00:24:13.290
Create a scalable logo version
that works in high contrast,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:19.832
works as small sizes, and in one color
for screen readers or embossing.

00:24:23.131 --> 00:24:26.521
Have accessibility issues in color system.

00:24:26.851 --> 00:24:30.420
When we talk about color system,
we're talking

00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:34.381
about the primary and secondary palettes
and your theme

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980
colors.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.880
We're talking
about how you use these colors,

00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:42.390
and also how you're able
to implement your color system,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:48.181
either in digital formats
like digital posters and the web,

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:50.011
printed formats

00:24:50.551 --> 00:24:54.358
like in papers, or your UI components.

00:24:55.889 --> 00:24:58.646
What are some of the issues we have
in color systems?

00:24:58.771 --> 00:25:02.233
One, low contrast
between text and background.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:05.649
This is a major issue most of the time.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:10.055
Using the wrong text color on background,

00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:13.171
causing the text to be blurry

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.041
or illegible for users
who have visual impairment.

00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:19.410
How do you fix this issue?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.672
Test and adjust your brand palettes
to meet at least

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:32.284
the AA, WCAG for 4.5
to 1 ratio for normal text.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.283
At least it should get
to the AA requirements.

00:25:36.574 --> 00:25:41.943
Another issue, brand colors
that look stylish but fail.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.760
They fail the WCAG contrast standards.
How do you fix this?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.970
Add secondary cues like icons,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.535
labels, patterns, shape alongside colors.

00:25:59.221 --> 00:26:05.523
Always test colors to make sure
that they pass the standards of WCAG.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.080
Another issue, relying on color alone

00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:12.331
for hierarchy or emphasis.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.812
This is a major problem.
How do you fix this?

00:26:16.261 --> 00:26:18.812
Do not use only color as emphasis.

00:26:18.813 --> 00:26:23.235
Rather, build accessible variations,
example, high color contrast versions

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:24.649
into your color system.

00:26:25.998 --> 00:26:31.279
Here is an example
of a good color contrast.

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:34.741
Here, we have a bad example.

00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:38.848
I'm sure some of us are struggling
to even see the text written

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.460
on some of the background.
It is very poor.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.361
Now, let's talk about the effects
of inaccessible brand

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.956
on users with disabilities.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.552
One, it causes exclusion from information
and inability to participate.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.617
Nobody likes to be excluded,
and the feeling of exclusion hurts.

00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:03.960
It makes people
feel like they are not wanted,

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.864
and that is a problem.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.275
Two, it can cause cognitive load
and confusion for users who have cognitive

00:27:13.276 --> 00:27:14.791
and learning disabilities.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.420
Three, it can cause frustration,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.319
loss of trust,

00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:26.507
and loss of interest in patronage
because when your brand is inaccessible,

00:27:26.508 --> 00:27:28.780
it screams, "this brand is not for you."

00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:31.853
It means, "you're not part
of the people I want to talk to.

00:27:31.854 --> 00:27:35.003
"You're not part of the people I want
to send the information to.

00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:37.862
You're not part of the people I want
to participate."

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.284
It makes people

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.749
with disability lose interest
and are often frustrated

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.590
when they're not able to complete
the task that they had planned to.

00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:51.519
It can also cause difficulty
in accessing important information

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.460
that could cause serious accidents.

00:27:53.941 --> 00:28:01.229
Accessibility should not be taken lightly
because it might be simple for people

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.110
who do not have disabilities,
but for people who have

00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:07.418
disabilities, it can be a serious issue.

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:15.090
Designers who try to design
for accessibility often come

00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:16.831
across different challenges.

00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:20.520
These challenges can come
in different forms.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.810
One, ignorance of brands
and absence of awareness.

00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:29.400
If a designer is contracted
and is designing for a brand,

00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:34.411
and the brand owner does not want
to implement accessibility,

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:38.820
maybe due to ignorance
or lack of awareness,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.401
it becomes a problem for the designer.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:49.531
No matter how much the designer puts
in effort to pitch to the brand owner

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.545
the importance of accessibility
to their brand,

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:53.761
they will not listen.

00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:58.037
In part of the country where I'm from,
we have a word for it.

00:28:58.038 --> 00:29:00.917
We call it oga-centered design.

00:29:00.918 --> 00:29:05.959
Oga, meaning your boss that contracted
you or employed you, centered design.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.338
It means no matter
what good intentions you have,

00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:13.681
no matter what ideas you have
to fix an accessibility issue,

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.400
if your boss says, "Do this,"
you're going to have to do it.

00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:18.611
No question to ask.

00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:22.898
This can be a problem for a designer,
especially a designer who is

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.100
an advocate for accessibility.

00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.451
Another issue is lack
of financial support.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:37.830
Because most brand owners do not support
or encourage or even know anything

00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:42.360
about implementing accessibility,
they don't provide extra resources

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.527
or financial support for you to make
sure that the brand design

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.969
or the branding you're doing
for their company is going

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.397
to be accessible.

00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:56.849
They don't provide extra finances
or resource for proper research

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:04.170
because proper research is often necessary
for a designer to put out an output

00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:11.818
or to design products that are inclusive
of people with disability.

00:30:13.461 --> 00:30:17.900
The designer doesn't know
which people with disability

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.283
are interested in the brand
because of lack of financial support

00:30:22.284 --> 00:30:23.750
to carry out that research.

00:30:24.351 --> 00:30:26.390
Another issue is limited time provided.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.128
Just like the brand owners
do not provide resources,

00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:35.381
they do not give a lot of time
for the designer to do their work.

00:30:35.382 --> 00:30:37.428
Most of the time,
they give limited time frame,

00:30:37.881 --> 00:30:39.619
and the work is rushed.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.827
A lot of companies tend to rush
the design team to put out

00:30:43.828 --> 00:30:47.120
a brand design or put out a task.

00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:52.803
They end up not getting an opportunity
to implement accessibility

00:30:52.804 --> 00:30:55.640
because some of the accessibility increase
can take time.

00:30:56.238 --> 00:30:58.100
This is also an issue that designers face.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.780
Blinding aesthetics.

00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:05.511
Inability to merge aesthetic
with usability can be a problem

00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:07.130
for a lot of designers.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.519
They are more focused
on making the brand design

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.800
look aesthetic
because of this misconception

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.440
that brand design is only visual.

00:31:18.711 --> 00:31:23.331
They just focus on making it visually
appealing and aesthetic,

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.971
taking away the usability.

00:31:26.361 --> 00:31:27.751
This can be a problem.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.770
Poor accessibility education.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.050
A lot of designers
do not have a foundation

00:31:33.051 --> 00:31:36.170
and background of accessibility in design

00:31:37.251 --> 00:31:38.669
for their training.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.429
I'm happy that now there are
a lot of resources,

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.829
a lot of learning organizations
that now take accessibility 101

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.189
for a lot of designers
who are breaking into design.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.809
Benefits of accessibility,

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.820
especially to brands.

00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:01.669
Unlike the misconception
that accessibility does not benefit

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.811
a brand and takes

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.080
their resources instead
of giving resources,

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.219
accessibility

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.110
creates room for wider reach
and market growth

00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:15.530
because over 1 billion people
have a disability.

00:32:15.921 --> 00:32:19.189
If you're designing a brand
that is inclusive of these people

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.551
with disability, you're opening doors
for over 1 billion people

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.491
with disabilities to be able
to patronize your brand.

00:32:26.091 --> 00:32:28.823
To be able to look at your design.

00:32:30.051 --> 00:32:31.792
To be able to patronize your brand.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.250
The global market is worth

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.413
over $13 trillion annually.

00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:44.754
Another thing, stronger brand trust
and reputation.

00:32:45.502 --> 00:32:48.441
When you're able to show
people with disabilities

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:54.890
that they are not excluded
and they are accommodated,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.703
you build your trust and you keep
your reputation as a brand.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.020
Nobody wants to associate
with an ableist company

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.484
or an ableist community.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.220
If you show that you're accommodating,
you build the trust of not just people

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:14.388
with disability,
but the trust of observers as well.

00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:20.960
Another benefit is reduced
legal compliance rates.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.691
When you meet accessibility laws
and standards,

00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.451
you prevent lawsuits and fines.

00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:29.598
A lot of countries have

00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:35.390
disability and accessibility laws
that protect and back people

00:33:35.391 --> 00:33:39.200
with disabilities,
and defaulters are punished.

00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:44.810
You either pay fines
and you also could have negative PR

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.780
from that and have a lot of lawsuits.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:56.000
Finally, you tend to build
a long-term customer loyalty and advocacy.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:00.201
It's not just a sprint.
It's a marathon.

00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:01.610
It's a continuous thing.

00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:05.240
When you build and have
a strong foundation in accessibility,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.141
you're able to build
your customer loyalty for a long time.

00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:14.726
When you are able to build
this strong customer loyalty,

00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:19.191
you are sending a message to investors
that your return of investment

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.291
is positive.

00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:25.970
Investors like to invest
where there is trust,

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:32.125
where they trust that the brand
or the company is going to deliver.

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:36.804
With this trust,
you're able to get investors.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.481
Now we've come to the end
of today's conversation.

00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:45.094
What did we learn after the session?

00:34:45.095 --> 00:34:49.761
We have been able to learn
that for a brand to be accessible,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.710
it means that everyone,

00:34:51.981 --> 00:34:56.251
including people with disability,
can perceive and understand

00:34:56.252 --> 00:35:01.610
what the brand represents and is able
to use that information efficiently

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.002
for their benefits.

00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:07.827
We have also learned
that typography, brand voice,

00:35:07.828 --> 00:35:12.261
color, iconography, and layout
are building blocks that make up a brand

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.692
and brand design.

00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:21.412
For a brand to be accessible
or for a brand design to be accessible,

00:35:21.413 --> 00:35:25.381
the typography, the brand voice,
the color, iconography, imagery,

00:35:25.383 --> 00:35:27.631
and layout have to be accessible.

00:35:27.632 --> 00:35:31.970
We've also been able to spot
and fix some accessibility issues

00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:33.380
that could appear

00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:36.201
in the brand assets.

00:35:37.611 --> 00:35:41.001
We've also been able to talk
about the effects of inaccessible brand

00:35:41.002 --> 00:35:43.190
on people with disabilities.

00:35:43.521 --> 00:35:47.660
We've also talked about the challenges
that brand designers face

00:35:47.721 --> 00:35:53.351
when they are designing for accessibility.

00:35:53.827 --> 00:35:56.541
Finally, we've been able
to talk about how accessibility

00:35:57.111 --> 00:35:59.198
benefits the brand.

00:35:59.497 --> 00:36:00.497
Thank you.

00:36:00.681 --> 00:36:01.951
Let us connect.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.148
Enjoy the rest of the event.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.980
<v Jeremy Rivera> Thank you, guys.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.569
Thank you, Victoria,
for the beautiful talk

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.070
about brand accessibility.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.779
We have a couple of questions,
and just a reminder

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.720
to those who have watched
the session,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.019
if you'd like to,
please drop your questions

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.930
in the Q&amp;A in the Zoom chat directly.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.979
If you dropped any questions
in the webinar chat,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.019
I'll ask you to drop
in the Q&amp;A so we can ask

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.330
the questions in a list format.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:42.609
Victoria, we are ready for the first
question, if you are ready.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.520
<v Victoria Ottah> Hello, everyone.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.972
<v Jeremy> Greetings, Victoria.

00:36:54.973 --> 00:36:56.060
<v Victoria> Thank you for listening in.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.220
Thank you for listening
to the session.

00:37:00.186 --> 00:37:02.542
I was going to type
the answer in the Q&amp;A.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.580
I was to type,
but let me just answer in person.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:06.940
<v Jeremy> Yes, please.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.439
I saw you were having discussions

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.169
with some of the people in the chat.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.580
Well, we have a couple
premier questions from June Liu.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.239
The first one is,
what are some misconceptions

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.339
that you hear about accessibility

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.130
in branding that you
would like to challenge?

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.240
<v Victoria> Before now,
designers do not really think

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.570
that they are part
of accessibility because,

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.360
"I'm not coding,
I'm not adding aria" and all of that.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.240
What does that have to do with me?

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.200
Especially brand designers,
because brand designers

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.900
believe or think
that "design is just visual.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.270
If someone has a visual disability,

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.780
they cannot even interact
with my design at all.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.339
I don't have to try
to make any effort

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.580
to make it accessible.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.330
They cannot see it,
so what's the point?"

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.010
That is one notion
I'm trying to correct.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.710
First, that brand
design is just visual.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.930
Brand design is not just visual.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.340
It's sensory.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.360
That means even if I cannot see
the design you put out

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.120
on my screen,
I should be able to hear it.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.930
If it's in the form
of animation or video,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.720
I should be able to understand
what you're communicating.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.320
I should be able to sense it.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.199
I should be able to feel
what your brand is communicating

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:42.530
or whatever product your brand
is trying to sell to the audience.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.750
That's a notion
I'm trying to correct.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.120
<v Jeremy> Thank you so much for that.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.260
For the next one,
can you share an example

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.579
where improving accessibility made

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.740
that brand more distinctive?

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.540
<v Victoria> Just like
the example I used

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.960
for the promotion poster for Nike.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.500
People with disabilities
now have the confidence

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.910
that this product
is for them as well.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:22.699
They can actually wear the products
that this particular organization

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.470
or company is putting out.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.050
It's not just
for a particular group of people.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.720
That one example has this power.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.190
The theme is them being
included in that imagery.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.679
That sends a statement.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.140
It sends a message that people

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.820
with disabilities are invited
into our organization.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.810
That's one very good example.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.200
<v Jeremy> We have another question
that popped up

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.650
in the webinar chat
and it's from another Victoria.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.410
The question is,
how do you test your brand design

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.460
or assets to be sure

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.090
that you're meeting
accessibility standards?

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.720
Then, are there tools
for that or do you use manual checks?

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.359
<v Victoria> Personally,
I believe that accessibility

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.380
testing should take three formats.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.780
Manual testing, automated testing,
and user testing.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.480
This also applies to design.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.859
You can test it manually
when you're designing.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.340
As a designer with keen
eye for alignment, hierarchy,

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.280
and knowing
all the principles of design,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:36.200
you know when your design looks out
of place and you should correct it.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.520
You can manually check
your images and see,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.629
"Oh, is there a place
where I'm supposed

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.970
to put my old text
and it's not there?"

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.870
You can put it.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.459
Sometimes, designers make the mistake
of checking their designs themselves

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.620
and using their own
eyes to look at designs.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.020
This is where user testing comes in.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:02.030
You give it to these users
who you're building or designing for.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.340
Let them check the design for you.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.540
Users with disabilities,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.689
ask them to check it and ask
them where they found

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.660
it difficult to understand
or what issues they got

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.570
from interacting with that design.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.109
Listen to feedback
and correct feedback.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.920
That's another thing.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.140
It's one thing to do user testing,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.410
it's another thing to accept
and implement feedback.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.720
Then, for automated tests, yes,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.340
if you're a designer
who designs with Figma,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.940
there are Figma plugins
like accessibility checker,

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.953
there is Stark, there is Humaaans,

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.009
and some other accessibility plugins

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.139
you can use to check
for accessibility,

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:47.380
either for contrast
or for text or alt text,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.550
for language.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.754
I listened to Yiga speak yesterday.

00:41:52.766 --> 00:41:56.120
She talked about differences
in culture and language.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.060
You can also use
the plugin to talk about that.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.110
Sorry, you can also use
the plugin to correct that issue.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.225
For Penpot users,
there's also an accessibility checker

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.640
in your Penpot plugin.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.420
For Adobe users as well,
there's an accessibility checker.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.809
You can either use
the accessibility checker plugins

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.849
in your tools or you can use
a general WAVE or browser

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:25.700
DevTools for just a general
check of your work.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.070
Most importantly, user testing.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.489
That's one of the most important ones
because people

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.040
with disabilities need
to use your designs

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.380
or interact with
your designs in real time.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.459
<v Jeremy> All right. Thank you.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.060
Thank you for that.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.180
Taco just asked a question.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.500
Would you say doing a full
brand redesign is worth it

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.589
for the sole purpose
of making your brand accessible?

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Victoria> Yes, I would.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.570
Because like I said,
it's not a sprint, it's a marathon.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.610
If you're building or designing

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.900
a product that you intend
to stand the test of time,

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.160
a design that is going to last
for time and time again,

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.320
you should prioritize your branding.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.180
It's not something that is going

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.849
to die down in a few years.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.200
It's something
that's going to stay for a long time.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.390
Rebuilding your branding,

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:28.220
just to ensure that it is accessible,
it's actually worth it.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.690
I think it is important.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Jeremy> Thank you so much.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.470
Then, can you give
a few great examples

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.740
of accessible brands
that are worth a shout out?

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.580
<v Victoria> Oh.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.859
Okay.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:52.550
Personally,
I like what Figma is doing.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.420
I like that Figma is adapting.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.680
I'm talking in terms
of tools now for designers.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.700
I like that Figma is adapting
to the accessibility plugins.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.922
There's even a plugin
for you to check

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.940
for accessibility guidelines
in case you're not sure,

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.770
it's not going outside the app
to check it, you can check it there.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.540
For general brands,

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.560
I like what WordPress
is doing as well.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.010
I am actually very impressed.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.929
From the comment section,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.599
Taco said something about
creating a plugin for design.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.220
I'm really anticipating that.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.079
I really want to use that.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.130
I really want to see that.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.080
Nike, I like what they are doing.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.570
I love what Apple is doing.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:34.550
I love what Google is doing.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.700
I love these products.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.729
<v Jeremy> Then, would you say that

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.989
the WordPress Accessibility Day brand
is accessible?

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.390
<v Victoria> Oh, yes.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.670
Let me just push
it to something shorter.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.420
The presentation slides.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.840
I like the presentation slides.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:06.620
Not all organizations prioritize
making their slides accessible.

00:45:06.799 --> 00:45:08.600
I think this is really a huge thing

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.620
because not every speaker
is a designer.

00:45:13.548 --> 00:45:16.640
They might not know how to tweak
and make their slides accessible.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:21.180
That template alone is actually,
it is amazing.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.680
I love it.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.410
It makes the work
easier and accessible.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.360
That's just one example.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.600
<v Jeremy> I have
a couple of questions, too.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:34.100
Now, what would you say
to a developer,

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.840
my background is a developer,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.179
and some of my peers are going out

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.170
of their way to make personal
developer sites.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.900
It's not always accessible.

00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:50.089
What would you say
to a developer who's trying

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.890
to get eyes from a recruiter

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.950
who doesn't know
how to make an accessible brand?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.910
<v Victoria> Is the developer
the person who has

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:06.420
the knowledge of accessibility
and the recruiter is not?

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.139
<v Jeremy> Sometimes.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:08.860
<v Victoria> I'm trying to understand.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.340
<v Jeremy> Sometimes.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.369
<v Victoria> It is always
very difficult,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.620
especially when you are working
for someone.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.020
Just the same way designers

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.740
have the issue of doing
what the boss says.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.540
It can be difficult,

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.480
but you're going to have to try
your best to implement

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.640
accessibility as much as you can.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.940
Sometimes it's not worth the pay.

00:46:35.275 --> 00:46:37.610
Sometimes they don't pay
you extra for accessibility.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:39.590
That's where it's a problem.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.399
That's why it's good in foundations

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.730
to try and implement
accessibility as much as you can.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.219
It's not easy to be the only person

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.420
who has the knowledge
of accessibility or trying

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.340
to make improvements
in accessibility.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.540
I don't know.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.900
I'll just say try as much as you can [laughs].

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.259
<v Jeremy> Of course. Right.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.300
Thank you so much for that.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.040
Then a final question.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.130
What resources would you recommend

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.120
to learn how to make
an accessible brand?

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.300
<v Victoria> Like I said earlier,
I'm happy a lot of organizations,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.950
a lot of learning communities
are providing resources.

00:47:20.715 --> 00:47:23.510
There are a lot
of good articles on Medium.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.080
If you just go search
accessibility on Medium,

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.190
there's so many amazing
things to read.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:34.800
You can check out
some learning tools like edX.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.840
There are some amazing courses on edX

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.960
where you can go take
some courses that could help you.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.420
You can also use the standard
web accessibility guideline.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:52.160
It seems complicated,
but in a way, now it's made easier.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.420
There's segregation,
accessibility for design,

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.929
for writing,
for this particular thing.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.580
You can use it as a reference
to check out what you want to do.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.249
You can start from the basics
and research, research,

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.350
research, use the internet.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.659
You don't have to use
a particular tool.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:14.720
If you're confused, go use Google,

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:16.689
search something
to clarify your confusion.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.430
<v Jeremy> All right. Thank you so much.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.770
I will say if you have
any other questions,

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.089
add them in the Slack channel.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.860
We have a thriving Slack channel.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.240
Thank you.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.190
Thank you all for attending
the session with Victoria Ottah.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:33.060
You can continue the conversation
in the chat on social media using

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.820
the hashtag #WPA11YDay

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:42.079
and hashtag #WPAD2025.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.259
We also appreciate it if you go to

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:50.599

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.620
to provide anonymous feedback
for our speakers on the presentation.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.290
You can enter to win
a t-shirt while you're there.

Stay tuned for a game
changing approach

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.700
to accessibility
education coming up next
