>> SHEROSE BADRUDDIN: Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:38.701
My name is Sherose Badruddin,

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.808
and I'm a Digital
Accessibility Consultant

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.244
with the University
of North Carolina.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.013
Thank you for joining us
for Make All WordPress

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:50.552
Events Accessible,
presented by Joe A. Simpson Jr.

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:53.520
Joe is a front-end web
developer and UX designer

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.358
specializing in accessible
enterprise-level WordPress solutions.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.793
When a hard event forced him
to take a leave of absence,

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:01.428
he attended his first Meetup,

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.197
beginning an incredible
eight-year journey

00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:06.333
that included giving back
to the WordPress community

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.602
in roles ranging from volunteer,

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:11.739
speaker, team rep,
Contributor Day table lead,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.142
Community Summit moderator,
WordCamp lead organizer

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:17.044
at both the local
and flagship levels,

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.446
and he started
three WordPress meetups,

00:02:19.447 --> 00:02:22.249
including two in
Santa Clarita and BlackPress

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.051
with two automaticians.

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:25.819
After three decades
as a public servant

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.721
at Metro Los Angeles Transit,

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:30.457
managing their blog network,
he retired to present topics

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.426
on WordPress and open-source tech

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:36.163

communities around the world.

00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:39.967

You can use the chat
to connect with other attendees.

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.410
>> JOE A. SIMPSON JR.:
I was laid out flat

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:55.849
on a cold, hard operating table,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.385
similar to the one that you see here,

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.854
and as the anesthesiologist
put the mask on,

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:02.856
I began to count backwards.

00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:07.896
100, 99, 98.

00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:11.498
As I slowly drifted off to sleep,

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.673
all I could think about
were these faces.

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.874
Just yesterday,
I was seated at the kitchen table,

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:24.412
my wife here, my daughter to my left,

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:29.650
and I had to do the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.053
We decided not to tell my daughter
about the surgical procedure

00:03:34.054 --> 00:03:36.423
because she was in the final
year of high school.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:40.561
She was preparing
her portfolio to go to art school.

00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:43.498
She was a creative,
just like her dad,

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:47.602
and we didn't want to interrupt that.

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:49.803
It was at the same kitchen table

00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:55.143
where I would sit
her on the table as a child,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.411
a little toddler,
and she would jump into my arms.

00:03:57.412 --> 00:03:59.813
I would take a step back,
she would jump again,

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:03.918
and we would do it over
and over and over again.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.052
But on this day,

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:09.813
I had to do the hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.160
I had to tell
her that there was a possibility

00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:17.287
that I wouldn't be coming
home tomorrow at this time.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.759
As I came to and left the hospital,

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.806
I decided to take a leave of absence,
a 90-day leave of absence

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.375
to heal physically and mentally.

00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:31.146
I had two 100% blocked arteries,

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:36.083
and it would take
all that I had to get back.

00:04:36.084 --> 00:04:39.953
I wanted to rediscover things
that gave me creative joy,

00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:42.122
and I wanted to define a new journey,

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.691
but just getting out
of bed was difficult.

00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.194
My road back led me to the outdoors.

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:51.321
I visited every outdoor
park in Santa Clarita Valley,

00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:53.033
putting one foot in front

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:58.038
of the other till 1 foot
became 10 feet,

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.684
which became a quarter of a lap,

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:03.243
then a full lap, until one day,

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:07.687
I was at the base of the hill
that you see on your right.

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:11.518
At the top of this hill,
it was the highest point

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.931
in the Santa Clarita
Valley at Central Park.

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.990
I decided before I went back to work

00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:21.362
in 90 days that I would get
to the top of this hill,

00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:27.539
but 5 days before I returned
to work in December,

00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:33.808
this is the view that I saw
just before sunrise,

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:38.913
overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley.

00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:45.064
You may be wondering,

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:46.982
"What the heck does this have to do

00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:49.793
with WordPress Accessibility Day?"

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.845
If today were my last day,

00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:02.746
would I be doing what I'm doing?

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.909
If the answer was "No"
too many days in a row,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.944
I'd make a change.

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.413
During my 90 days,
I wanted to truly give back

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:17.618
and continue to grow creatively,
and I thought back.

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.321
When I first learned WordPress,
our lead developer

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.357
and our CSS goddess both left

00:06:23.358 --> 00:06:25.392
our agency within 30 days
of each other,

00:06:25.393 --> 00:06:29.830
and I inherited our news blog
that was done in WordPress.

00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:33.200
We had budget to do some learning,

00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.169
and they sent me to the WordPress VIP

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.389
Intensive Developer Sessions

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.564
that were being held in Napa,
California.

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.845
On the first day, during the event,

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.993
they asked us to spin
up a virtual box,

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:49.183
pull my jaw up off the floor.

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:51.415
Something amazing happened.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:56.924
Everybody in arm's distance
offered to help,

00:06:56.925 --> 00:07:00.160
and that's how I learned
what the WordPress community was.

00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:03.263
When I was on my leave,
I thought back to that time,

00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:06.600
and I was thinking,
"I really want to give back

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:12.574
to the WordPress community,
recreate that feeling that I got."

00:07:14.275 --> 00:07:17.812
I decided to go to my first Meetup.

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.614
At that first Meetup,
the organizing team

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.216
from WordCamp Los Angeles was there,

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:25.419
and they needed volunteers,
so I volunteered,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.313
which was an incredible experience,

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.555
and the ball got rolling.

00:07:30.758 --> 00:07:32.859
In addition to attending
my first meetup,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.862
I went to over 20 meetups
over the next three months

00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:40.167
in all 5 counties in Los Angeles,
from Inland Empire, San Diego,

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.568
Northern Los Angeles County.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:46.574
I attended my first
WordCamp in Riverside.

00:07:46.608 --> 00:07:48.809
I attended WordCamp US virtually.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.145
I did anything and everything
in the WordPress space.

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:55.482
I was tired of getting home at 10:30,
eleven o'clock at night,

00:07:55.483 --> 00:07:56.950
driving all over Southern California,

00:07:56.951 --> 00:07:58.619
and I decided to start a meetup.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.754
I didn't start one; I started three.

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:04.024
I began to think,
"Hey, I want to organize a WordCamp,"

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.360
and we organized
the first WordCamp north

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:10.430
of Los Angeles and south
of San Francisco since 2015.

00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.599
One of the crowning moments,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.334
the thing that
I'm really most proud of,

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:18.438
is that our third edition,
we had the very first WordCamp

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:21.208
to have a dedicated
track to accessibility.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.811
We had about 14 speakers,
which you see here on screen,

00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:27.047
and it was an incredible achievement.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.082
There's so many
talented and passionate

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:32.336
people in the community,
and this was sort

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:35.289
of all that energy
that we were generating.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.891
In December,
I decided to leave Metro.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:41.828
After 33 years, I wanted to find
out what was next in my journey.

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:44.398
One of the things that I wanted
to do was I wanted to give back

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.067
to the WordPress community
that had given me so much,

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.835
and I decided I wanted to present

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.671
open-source and technology topics

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:54.207
to emerging and
underrepresented communities

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.909
all around the world.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.645
I presented at WordCamp
Asia in Taiwan.

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:01.081
I presented at WordCamp San José

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.816
in Costa Rica, and I want to continue

00:09:02.817 --> 00:09:07.020
to do that moving forward,
But first, a little bit about me.

00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.522
My name is Joe Simpson, Jr.

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:10.837
I'm a SiteGround ambassador.

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:14.059
I'm a community leader in WordPress,

00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:21.034
and roles varying from volunteer,
team rep, and member

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:24.288
on the Make Accessible
and training teams,

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.842
to speaker, to lead organizer.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.599
I worked in public transportation

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.946
for over 30 years
at Metro Los Angeles,

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.982
the third largest transportation
agency in the nation,

00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:40.253
managing a blog network
of over 14 WordPress sites.

00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.956
Prior to that,
working for Fortune 500 companies

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.959
in the corporate identity
and branding space

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.828
at Unisys and Chrysler corporations

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:50.630
during major merger
and reorganizations.

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.836
I'm an advocate for accessibility
and user experience.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.139
We all may know
what Make WordPress Accessible means,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.943
but I want to take
a twist on that and suggest

00:10:02.944 --> 00:10:06.435
that we Make All WordPress
Events Accessible.

00:10:10.084 --> 00:10:13.487
First, my slides are available
in multiple formats.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.424
I have a follow-along slide
deck that's very basic with just

00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:19.893
the text that's provided
in these slides,

00:10:19.894 --> 00:10:23.463
if you want to follow along there,
as well as I'll provide

00:10:23.464 --> 00:10:26.364
a link to the slides, which is here.

00:10:27.068 --> 00:10:31.828
I'll give you a second to scan
if you'd like to follow along,

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.708
as well as a link to a document

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:37.883
where all of these links
are going to be.

00:10:39.147 --> 00:10:44.304
I always like to provide a couple
of ways to take in these slides.

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:47.913
Accessibility is a floor,
not a ceiling.

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:53.293
The common things
that you hear about accessibility,

00:10:53.294 --> 00:10:56.129
the point of these bullets
is that we all eventually grow

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.304
into a disability
of one form or another,

00:11:00.401 --> 00:11:04.438
and we should all be open and honest
about making sure

00:11:04.439 --> 00:11:06.273
that the spaces that we work in,

00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:10.638
the spaces that we WordPress
in are accessible and open.

00:11:11.646 --> 00:11:13.413
I share this slide because I was part

00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:15.782
of an equity liaison at Metro,

00:11:15.783 --> 00:11:18.485
and it was an 18-month program
where we sort

00:11:18.486 --> 00:11:20.854
of looked at transportation
topics in terms

00:11:20.855 --> 00:11:23.824
of making them
as equitable as possible

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.792
for all of the communities
that we service.

00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:28.762
Our team project
was equitable transportation,

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:31.731
and one of the team members,
she thought

00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:34.801
that our presentation should only
address people that were deaf.

00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:37.304
I shared this with her to show
her the number of disabilities

00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:41.510
and that we would have to address
in our presentation.

00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:42.843
Here's a little bit of history.

00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:45.212
During the pandemic,
there was an incredible documentary

00:11:45.213 --> 00:11:49.549
that came out, and I think,
especially in today's climate,

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.819
it's important to know about
the history of accessibility,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.990
especially as our current
administration

00:11:56.157 --> 00:11:59.961
is making a lot of drastic changes

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.464
to how government functions,
and a lot of people

00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:06.600
are worried that it's going to impact
accessibility.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.668
I like to give you a little
bit of history in hopes

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:13.206
that it will help inform the choices
that you make going forward.

00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:17.177
Crip Camp was a documentary
on Netflix during the pandemic.

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:20.080
It followed a group
of young teenagers

00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:23.684
who attended a camp
in upstate New York,

00:12:24.051 --> 00:12:28.655
and it was amazing
because this group of kids

00:12:28.656 --> 00:12:31.053
eventually changed the world.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:35.874
Back then, if you had a disability,

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:38.198
chances were you could
have been committed.

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:40.467
Went on to college
and they began to do great things.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.737
They began to do sit-ins,

00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:45.705
advocate for the rights
of those with disabilities,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.143
catch buses or trains,
enter buildings, so many things

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.912
in the physical world
provided barriers

00:12:51.913 --> 00:12:55.332
that they just couldn't get
around and bring awareness

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:59.553
to the public at large about
the changes that were needed,

00:12:59.554 --> 00:13:02.355
and one of the incredible things,
they were influenced

00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:04.265
by the Civil Rights Movement

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:06.660
that had happened
in the '60s and '70s.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.930
One of the landmark events in terms

00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:12.766
of their protests
was the Capitol Crawl,

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:15.802
where a number of folks
with disabilities tried to enter

00:13:15.803 --> 00:13:17.971
the Capitol as part of their protest,

00:13:17.972 --> 00:13:20.040
and they climbed the stairs.

00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.875
Back then,
buildings weren't accessible,

00:13:21.876 --> 00:13:26.046
so the only way you can get
into a building were stairs to access

00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:28.381
if you couldn't walk upstairs.

00:13:28.382 --> 00:13:31.251
It created so much momentum,

00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:34.902
the Americans with
Disabilities Act was passed.

00:13:35.222 --> 00:13:39.059
We are the stewards
of where accessibility

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.628
can go from here, and especially
in the WordPress space,

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:43.778
you can make a difference.

00:13:44.098 --> 00:13:45.532
If I cannot do great things,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.469
I can do small things in a great way.

00:13:52.473 --> 00:13:53.762
One of the things that I'm proud of

00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:57.243
was that during my time
on the organizing team,

00:13:57.244 --> 00:14:00.413
as a captain for WordCamp
US in San Diego,

00:14:00.414 --> 00:14:03.249
I compiled a list
of things that I thought

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.785
would make our event accessible,

00:14:05.786 --> 00:14:09.289
and I list them out in bullet points,
and my team mentor,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.693
or one of the leads for WordCamp
US that year, she took

00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:17.464
that information and published
it on Make so that other events

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:21.353
or other WordCamps
could utilize this information.

00:14:21.969 --> 00:14:24.170
Here are some of the bullet
points from it.

00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:27.007
It's a little more involved in terms

00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:29.209
of a document,
and I'll share the link.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.611
It's at the end of the slides.

00:14:31.612 --> 00:14:33.251
I'll share the link
so that you can get in

00:14:33.252 --> 00:14:35.318
and utilize that as well,

00:14:36.087 --> 00:14:39.754
but these are some of the key points.

00:14:40.454 --> 00:14:45.532
When you're organizing a team,
try to be as inclusive as possible

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.794
in terms of the people
that you invite

00:14:47.795 --> 00:14:51.165
to organize, the volunteers,
and speakers.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.969
They offer perspectives
that you may not have.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.959
Offer a seat at the table
for outspoken voices

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.451
as resources, collaborators,
and inspiration.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.609
One of the things
that I pride myself on

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.748
is that in the WordPress space,

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:11.686
there are so many important
and eclectic voices.

00:15:13.721 --> 00:15:16.322
People are always sharing
their information with each other.

00:15:16.323 --> 00:15:18.242
People are always trying
to help each other,

00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:20.482
so I try to incorporate
as many of those voices

00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:25.005
in the decisions that I make in terms
of organizing event.

00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:30.637
I also suggest you leverage
pre-existing efforts.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.473
There's articles and information.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.974
There's things on Make.

00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:37.377
There's things on the blog
that you can tap

00:15:37.378 --> 00:15:41.014
into to help
you make informed decisions.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:45.251
The other cool thing that happened
was when I published that document,

00:15:45.252 --> 00:15:49.022
and again, I'll share
a link in my resource slides,

00:15:49.023 --> 00:15:51.491
people started to reach out to me

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:54.428
through Slack on the Make channel.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.531
One of the first things
that I always suggest

00:15:58.532 --> 00:15:59.666
if you're planning an event

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:03.504
like a WordCamp
is to scout the venue.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:07.107
A lot of times,
a decision on a venue is made

00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:10.610
without touring the venue, or maybe

00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:13.880
it's without touring the venue
with people that are aware

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.249
of accessibility and can look

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.052
at the venue in terms
of how accessible it is,

00:16:19.053 --> 00:16:21.642
and if there are any issues
that need to be addressed

00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:26.861
that could be major
problems in terms of the event.

00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:28.528
One of the stories
that I like to share

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:32.098
was when I was on the team
as a captain for WordCamp US,

00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:33.448
when it was in San Diego,

00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:36.102
it was at a really incredible
location.

00:16:36.103 --> 00:16:39.673
It was a retro resort
called Town and Country.

00:16:40.574 --> 00:16:41.941
It had the '50s vibe.

00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:45.512
The architecture looked
like it was from the '50s modernist.

00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:47.592
Unfortunately,
it was one of the worst conferences

00:16:47.593 --> 00:16:49.816
in terms of the venue
being accessible,

00:16:49.817 --> 00:16:53.186
and there were a number of problems
in terms of accessibility.

00:16:53.187 --> 00:16:55.855
Michelle Frechette
wrote an incredible article

00:16:55.856 --> 00:17:00.378
on the experiences that she had
trying to get in doorways,

00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:03.952
there were no elevators,
things like that.

00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:09.569
I try to take this information in,
and I try to use it in terms

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.049
of the events that I organize.

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:14.240
Again, tour the venue
as early as possible,

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.042
ideally with someone
that has a disability.

00:17:16.043 --> 00:17:20.614
Get the physical venue
for things that may be an issue.

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:24.184
Are the entrances open?

00:17:24.185 --> 00:17:25.318
Are they wide enough?

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.757
Bathrooms, conference spaces,
auditoriums,

00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:34.360
do they have paddles,
handles, and counter heights

00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:38.866
that are accessible to someone
in an assistive device?

00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:42.335
Here's some pictures from my time

00:17:42.336 --> 00:17:44.139
as a lead organizer for WordCamp US

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.873
when it was in National Harbor.

00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:48.041
We took a tour of the venue early.

00:17:48.042 --> 00:17:50.076
We asked lots of questions.

00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:53.106
Also took us to the hotel room,

00:17:53.107 --> 00:17:55.782
which I'll show
you some more pictures in a second.

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.817
The main area of every conference

00:17:57.818 --> 00:18:02.456
is "How do you get into the venue?"

00:18:03.724 --> 00:18:07.294
It gave you specs on doorway widths.

00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:10.930
Again, a lot of the things
that someone with an assistive device

00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:13.633
or disability
wouldn't be impacted by.

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:16.966
Looking at the front
entrance for doorways,

00:18:17.124 --> 00:18:21.007
automatic doors, paddles,
and it was really cool

00:18:21.008 --> 00:18:22.642
that on the day I took the picture,

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:26.769
someone in an assistive
device was leaving the venue.

00:18:27.348 --> 00:18:30.241
Also, stairs, escalators, elevators

00:18:30.308 --> 00:18:33.486
in relation to conference rooms,
dining area,

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:38.292
sponsor hall, and your hotel rooms.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.963
Also, the speaker spaces,
stage heights,

00:18:43.964 --> 00:18:46.065
how the chairs were being laid out,

00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:49.716
the aisleways,
things of that nature, lighting.

00:18:51.238 --> 00:18:54.741
In terms of the hotel,
we also toured the hotel

00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:58.233
with the representative
from the event space.

00:18:58.812 --> 00:19:00.813
This hotel had accessible rooms,

00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:04.284
so we looked at the variety
of accessibility rooms,

00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:07.388
and it impacted
how we made decisions.

00:19:07.922 --> 00:19:10.957
In terms of wayfinding
for your events,

00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:16.263
always provide basic,
simple maps and signage.

00:19:17.231 --> 00:19:21.435
I would say avoid
venue-provided or "designed"

00:19:22.836 --> 00:19:26.072
pieces that the venue may provide.

00:19:26.073 --> 00:19:27.807
One of the things
I remember about WordCamp

00:19:27.808 --> 00:19:31.077
US and National Harbor
was that the information

00:19:31.078 --> 00:19:33.012
that they provided was "designed"

00:19:33.013 --> 00:19:37.785
so that meant there were tiny
light gray-type colors

00:19:39.586 --> 00:19:43.145
that had color contrast issues,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:46.292
I basically recreated
some of the maps,

00:19:46.293 --> 00:19:48.761
which I'll show you in a second.

00:19:48.762 --> 00:19:50.730
Provide wayfinding
in multiple formats.

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:53.933
Again, most WordCamps
have a map of the venue,

00:19:53.934 --> 00:19:58.932
but it's a graphic like a JPEG
or a PDF, which isn't accessible.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.509
Provide it in multiple formats,

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.180
and I'll talk a little bit
about that in a second.

00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:10.984
One thing that I did,
and I think it may have been a first,

00:20:10.985 --> 00:20:12.485
was to offer common path maps

00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:15.422
and descriptions to key event spaces.

00:20:16.156 --> 00:20:21.294
I'll talk about that in a second,
but also, please place clear,

00:20:21.295 --> 00:20:24.330
concise signage at key areas

00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:26.667
and spots along common path.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.272
This is an example
of a common path map that I did.

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:36.275
I took a lot of the printed
brochures that they provided to us

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:40.881
as an organizing team,
and I redrew maps,

00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:45.852
and I listed the common
pathways for our event,

00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:49.422
entering the building to get
to the registration desk,

00:20:49.423 --> 00:20:51.424
from the registration
desk to your room,

00:20:51.425 --> 00:20:54.227
from your room
to the conference space,

00:20:54.228 --> 00:20:56.496
from your room to the dining room,

00:20:56.497 --> 00:20:59.298
from your room to the sponsor area.

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:02.502
I provided that in
a visual format, but also,

00:21:02.503 --> 00:21:04.771
one of our team members was blind.

00:21:04.772 --> 00:21:07.140
Alex Stein was on the team that year,

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:12.060
and he attended a conference
at the National Braille Institute.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.650
Their site had extensive
directions that were turn-by-turn.

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.378
Directions were in a text format.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:24.591
I went in, and I did
the same for our venue.

00:21:26.393 --> 00:21:30.129
What you see here is how to get
from the main entrance

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.566
to the resort registration,
in terms of text format.

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:36.102
The cool thing
was that the venue had an app.

00:21:36.103 --> 00:21:38.071
Again, the app wasn't accessible.

00:21:38.072 --> 00:21:43.109
I took that information
and turned it into a document

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.677
that we placed on the website.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.075
It was in a text-only format.

00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:50.483
Also, we provided
a video walkthrough.

00:21:50.484 --> 00:21:53.513
Someone on the team
did that wayfinding

00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:55.689
for our attendees to use.

00:21:55.989 --> 00:21:58.925
We had at least three ways
to figure out

00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:00.593
the location of the venue.

00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:02.663
I would also suggest
getting this information up

00:22:02.664 --> 00:22:03.896
as early as possible because,

00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:06.099
again, you want
to provide all attendees

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.902
as much information as possible
on getting to the venue,

00:22:09.903 --> 00:22:12.105
getting around the venue,
so they can make decisions

00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:13.306
on whether they can make it,

00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:15.842
or they can provide
suggestions or tips

00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:19.096
on how we can make
the information better.

00:22:20.013 --> 00:22:23.142
The picture you see here
was from our WordCamp

00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:25.151
in 2019 in Santa Clarita.

00:22:25.152 --> 00:22:26.953
I show you this picture.

00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:31.525
This building was very accessible,
even back in 2019.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.034
It was a newer facility,

00:22:33.035 --> 00:22:36.129
better technology,
better open spaces.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.631
I show you this picture
because there were two people

00:22:38.632 --> 00:22:41.200
from our community
that you see in the front row here.

00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:43.069
They had assistive devices.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.806
The room was set up
so that they can just wheel in,

00:22:46.807 --> 00:22:49.628
riding assistive
devices into the room,

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:50.977
park them out of the way.

00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:55.281
We also had someone that was doing
the captions for the videos in place,

00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:57.441
so it was a space that was open

00:22:57.442 --> 00:22:59.051
to as many people as possible.

00:22:59.052 --> 00:23:01.020
Does your hotel block or venue offer

00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:03.500
a variety of accessible rooms?

00:23:03.524 --> 00:23:07.693
Will your venue or organizing
team provide support in terms

00:23:07.694 --> 00:23:11.798
of on-call texting
or services to assist disabled?

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:13.867
One member of the team,

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:16.669
and what I was proud of as
well as one of the organizers,

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.173
I suggested we have a dedicated
accessibility team

00:23:20.174 --> 00:23:25.111
as one of the core
teams on a WordCamp.

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:29.071
Generally, accessibility
is part of attendee experience,

00:23:29.072 --> 00:23:30.883
so we work closely with them,

00:23:30.884 --> 00:23:33.953
but we also wanted
to have more direct input

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:38.357
on all the teams in terms
of suggesting accessible fixes

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:40.726
or things in terms
of accessibility practices

00:23:40.727 --> 00:23:44.059
that we wanted to see
throughout the event.

00:23:44.164 --> 00:23:48.624
When I posted my suggestions on Make

00:23:49.502 --> 00:23:51.537
for making events accessible,

00:23:51.538 --> 00:23:55.875
I heard from someone named
Ryan Bourne, who, disability,

00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:57.310
and he suggested a number of ways

00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.912
that we can make WordCamp
US accessible,

00:23:59.913 --> 00:24:01.214
and again, I love collaborating.

00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:04.050
I love learning,
so he suggested a number of things

00:24:04.051 --> 00:24:07.225
that we were able
to incorporate as well.

00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.424
He has issues in large crowds,

00:24:11.425 --> 00:24:16.496
so he suggested offering distance
badges to let attendees know

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.299
your level of comfort in terms
of being around other people.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.980
We implemented that.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.404
Also, I mentioned we work

00:24:25.405 --> 00:24:27.873
closely with the Attendee
Experience Team,

00:24:27.874 --> 00:24:30.644
and then also, I would suggest

00:24:31.578 --> 00:24:34.213
briefing other teams,
like the volunteers,

00:24:34.214 --> 00:24:38.784
on accessibility-specific
instructions

00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:42.055
in terms of how the event should go.

00:24:42.723 --> 00:24:44.591
The event live stream.

00:24:44.992 --> 00:24:49.262
Offer low-capacity viewing
rooms or quiet rooms

00:24:49.263 --> 00:24:51.898
for neurodivergent attendees,

00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:57.038
live captioned program presentations,

00:24:57.039 --> 00:25:01.808
and consider using ASL
for at least a keynote.

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:05.945
Offer pre-recorded content
for neurodivergent attendees.

00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.014
This was another suggestion by Ryan,

00:25:08.015 --> 00:25:12.451
in that some people may not feel
comfortable in larger crowds.

00:25:12.452 --> 00:25:16.055
The lower-capacity viewing
rooms are there for them as well,

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.625
but they may want to watch from home,

00:25:18.626 --> 00:25:22.862
so offer some of the sessions
as pre-recorded content,

00:25:22.863 --> 00:25:26.399
so maybe offer the keynote
or the closing remarks

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.136
in a recorded format.

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:30.670
Another thing that's good in terms

00:25:30.671 --> 00:25:33.005
of usability is providing time points

00:25:33.006 --> 00:25:35.641
on YouTube videos to allow
people to jump around quickly.

00:25:35.642 --> 00:25:40.414
That's, again, something
that I would suggest as a nicety.

00:25:43.383 --> 00:25:46.252
In terms of the speaker
slides that are provided,

00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:52.058
this event has some really great
speaker slide requirements

00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:56.819
that help make our slides
as open and accessible as possible.

00:25:56.997 --> 00:25:59.965
For your speakers in the slides,
verbally describe

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:02.981
your graphics
or images while speaking.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:09.109
Caption, add ALT text
or descriptions to all your images.

00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:12.993
Make your presentation
slides available online.

00:26:14.314 --> 00:26:17.750
Make your presentation
slides available before, during,

00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:20.786
and after your presentation
so that people can refer back

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:25.425
to them and use
your information to affect others.

00:26:26.493 --> 00:26:28.294
In terms of the event website,
and I've seen

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:31.230
some interesting
websites for WordCamp,

00:26:31.231 --> 00:26:34.100
test all your posts
or pages for accessibility.

00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:37.195
Start with
an accessibility-ready theme.

00:26:37.504 --> 00:26:41.508
Avoid low-color contrast
text and designs.

00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:44.944
Add proper ALT text
to all your images,

00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:48.148
including social media messaging.

00:26:57.653 --> 00:27:02.094
>> JOE: As the last suggestion,
I would suggest you contribute.

00:27:02.095 --> 00:27:04.657
I would urge you to contribute.

00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:12.267
Join the team
at Make WordPress Accessible.

00:27:12.806 --> 00:27:15.980
These are some resources
to join the team

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:18.986
because testers are always needed.

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:23.110
They're making lots of incredible
accessibility improvements

00:27:23.111 --> 00:27:27.395
to the open-source project,
and we need people to test.

00:27:27.888 --> 00:27:32.159
These are links to the various
pieces of information.

00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:35.791
These are links for the team,
office hours,

00:27:37.097 --> 00:27:40.299
bug scrubs, which happen weekly,
team meetings,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.301
which happen every other week.

00:27:42.302 --> 00:27:46.305
There's also a link
to the calendar for all of the teams,

00:27:46.306 --> 00:27:49.208
as well as a contributor wizard,
which walks you through.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.378
It helps you find out
which team is right for you.

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:57.457
It helps you join Slack and set
up your profile on WordPress.org,

00:27:57.617 --> 00:28:01.020
and they also have a course,
a basic level course,

00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:03.530
to get you onboarded
and up and running

00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:05.858
if you've never done
any contributing before.

00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:10.464
Again, I would urge you to help
Make WordPress Accessible.

00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:13.532
Here are some links that I love

00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:16.769
to share in terms of digging deeper

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.505
into the subject
that I'm talking about today.

00:28:19.506 --> 00:28:21.025
There's also a document

00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:23.175
similar to what I'm talking
about today

00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:25.575
by the Web Accessibility Initiative

00:28:25.576 --> 00:28:27.079
on making events accessible.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.014
I would urge
you to take a look at that,

00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:30.564
as well as they also have

00:28:30.565 --> 00:28:33.285
one on the accessibility
of remote meetings.

00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:36.388
One of the things
that we do in the WordPress

00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:38.224
space is we meet virtually.

00:28:38.225 --> 00:28:40.326
How do we make sure
that our Zoom meetings

00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:42.806
are as accessible as possible?

00:28:43.697 --> 00:28:48.100
There's also my venue accessibility
checklist, which is there.

00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:53.099
It's my first steps as part
of the WordPress Organizer Handbook.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.309
There's links to a couple of clips

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:02.215
from the Crip
Camp documentary on how ADA

00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:06.151
and the team behind Crip Camp,

00:29:06.152 --> 00:29:10.122
the Americans with Disabilities
Act changed the built world

00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:12.157
and so many things
that we take for granted now,

00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:15.887
even though there's always room
for improvement.

00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:18.130
It talks about back in the '60s,

00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:21.066
there was a documentary
that appeared on national television

00:29:21.067 --> 00:29:23.836
that showed the disgusting
conditions that a lot of kids

00:29:23.837 --> 00:29:27.249
that were disabled
were living in in the US,

00:29:27.674 --> 00:29:32.979
and it helped change and create
some impetus to change

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.930
and make real change
in terms of accessibility.

00:29:38.184 --> 00:29:39.752
Also, there's a couple
of great stories

00:29:39.753 --> 00:29:42.855
by a couple of people
I respect in the community.

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:45.891
Meryl Evans shared her experience

00:29:45.892 --> 00:29:48.227
in presenting
at South by Southwest and things

00:29:48.228 --> 00:29:50.529
that she suggested they improve,

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.966
as well as Rachel Lowenstein did
the same as well,

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:57.903
in terms of seeing
the event from a person

00:29:57.904 --> 00:30:00.631
with a neurodivergent disability.

00:30:21.394 --> 00:30:25.331
>> JOE: I'll leave you with this quote
by Ta-Nehisi Coates.

00:30:25.332 --> 00:30:27.166
"I'm all for bridging gaps,

00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:31.055
but not at the expense
of my neighbor's humanity."

00:30:31.237 --> 00:30:35.521
Be steadfast in your advocacy
for an open and inclusive

00:30:35.609 --> 00:30:41.648
WordPress event space,
and please take care of each other.

00:30:41.915 --> 00:30:45.384
By being part of today,
you've taken the first step towards

00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:47.863
changing the WordPress products,

00:30:47.864 --> 00:30:51.256
services, and environments
that you create

00:30:51.257 --> 00:30:53.984
for your communities and clients.

00:30:54.427 --> 00:30:57.563
I'm so excited to hear about
what you do in the future,

00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.431
and I would love to hear about it.

00:30:59.432 --> 00:31:03.302
You can find me on any
of these social media platforms

00:31:03.303 --> 00:31:05.104
by searching for Joe Simpson Jr.

00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:09.542
For example, joesimpsonjr@gmail

00:31:10.143 --> 00:31:12.622
or instagram.com/joesimpsonjr.

00:31:15.348 --> 00:31:16.949
We're in the early planning stages

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.518
for WordCamp Santa Clarita Valley,

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.819
and you can find out more about

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.557
that by joining
our local community here

00:31:25.558 --> 00:31:28.093
at WordPressSCV as we learn

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:31.188
and share more about
WordPress together.

00:31:32.298 --> 00:31:36.468
Thank you for joining me
during WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:39.039
It's truly an honor to be here.

00:31:39.072 --> 00:31:42.775
As a fan, I've watched the event
grow in scope and stature,

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:44.485
and it's an incredible testament

00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:47.818
to the incredible
organizers of this event.

00:31:47.914 --> 00:31:50.150
I thank you for having me.

00:31:50.884 --> 00:31:53.653
As promised, here are my slides.

00:32:06.579 --> 00:32:10.902
>> JOE: Here's the resource
links in a doc file.

00:32:36.586 --> 00:32:40.077
>> JOE: Now I'd like to open it up
to questions.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.558
Sherose Badruddin: Hey, Joe.

00:32:49.579 --> 00:32:55.499
Thank you so much for your very moving
and informative presentation.

00:32:55.597 --> 00:32:57.867
I see that you've been answering
some questions in the Q&A,

00:32:57.888 --> 00:32:58.936
and we have time

00:32:58.957 --> 00:33:02.164
if the audience would like to ask
more questions in the Q&A.

00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:06.995
What I'd like to do is read the questions
that you've answered, and if you would,

00:33:07.016 --> 00:33:08.937
just read the answers that you wrote.

00:33:09.014 --> 00:33:10.003
Joe A. Simpson Jr.: Sure.

00:33:10.024 --> 00:33:11.335
Sherose: Thank you. Thank you.

00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:16.029
Okay, so the first one was,
what are the most accessible maps

00:33:16.118 --> 00:33:17.964
that you use on websites?

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:21.933
Joe: Right, and as I mentioned
in the presentation,

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:25.754
you have to go about it
in multiple ways.

00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:28.394
What we did in addition to the PDFs

00:33:28.414 --> 00:33:33.173
and the standard JPEG graphics
or PNGs that you get on WordCamp sites,

00:33:33.391 --> 00:33:36.981
we did the text-only, turn-by-turn,

00:33:37.001 --> 00:33:40.986
and it was cool that
at that venue, they had an app.

00:33:41.255 --> 00:33:42.542
It was very inaccessible,

00:33:42.563 --> 00:33:47.632
but it at least provided directions
on the front door to the check-in area,

00:33:47.652 --> 00:33:48.719
the front door.

00:33:48.946 --> 00:33:53.212
We were able to take that information
and turn it into a text-only version

00:33:53.233 --> 00:33:54.213
that we put up on the website.

00:33:54.226 --> 00:33:55.318
That's another one.

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:56.754
That's a little bit of work.

00:33:56.791 --> 00:34:01.111
I would say we did
a video walkthrough as well,

00:34:01.142 --> 00:34:05.799
so try to provide that information
in as many formats as possible.

00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:08.544
Try to get that information up
as soon as possible.

00:34:08.648 --> 00:34:13.624
Again, one of the great bits of wisdom
that I got from people that I worked with,

00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:17.911
I would contact Joe Dolson
or people along the Make channels.

00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:23.095
Joe mentioned getting that information up
as early as possible

00:34:23.115 --> 00:34:25.549
so that people can make
an informed decision.

00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:28.026
I would try to get
all that information up

00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:29.723
as soon as possible in those formats

00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:32.211
because a couple of those things
took quite a while,

00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:33.973
but if you've got a team helping you,

00:34:33.994 --> 00:34:37.787
you can get as much up as early
as possible to give people that knowledge

00:34:37.804 --> 00:34:40.940
so they can make a decision on
whether they can attend or not.

00:34:40.984 --> 00:34:42.801
Sherose: Yes,
a strong, proactive strategy.

00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:43.873
Thank you.

00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:45.254
Before I go on to the next question,

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:47.482
I want to make sure that
the audience knows

00:34:47.797 --> 00:34:51.782
Joe's slides can be found
on his session page.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:52.992
Okay.

00:34:53.248 --> 00:34:56.062
The next question we had here was,
what accessibility needs

00:34:56.082 --> 00:34:58.375
are often overlooked in online events

00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:00.830
beyond, like
standard digital accessibility?

00:35:00.841 --> 00:35:01.953
This was a good question.

00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:03.407
What was your answer?

00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:06.437
Joe: Okay.

00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:12.649
Generally, most meetups
or WordCamps may not have ASL

00:35:12.706 --> 00:35:15.912
or captioning built into the process.

00:35:16.991 --> 00:35:18.603
I would say
that's probably the biggest thing.

00:35:18.624 --> 00:35:21.787
One of the biggest reasons is that
there's no budget for it.

00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:26.126
I would say if I could snap my fingers
and magically change one thing

00:35:26.146 --> 00:35:29.766
that would really impact it
is make it mandatory,

00:35:29.787 --> 00:35:33.805
make it a part of every foundation,
effort in a meetup space

00:35:33.825 --> 00:35:36.605
or in a WordCamp space
has that built in.

00:35:36.754 --> 00:35:40.851
One of the cool suggestions
that Ryan gave me was,

00:35:41.046 --> 00:35:42.792
if you're having an event,

00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:46.941
try to prerecord some stuff
and get it up ahead of time.

00:35:47.174 --> 00:35:49.153
Try to provide it in as many formats.

00:35:49.358 --> 00:35:51.152
People that may not,

00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:54.751
if they're in a certain space
and they don't like being around,

00:35:54.772 --> 00:35:57.331
they feel uncomfortable
in large crowds,

00:35:57.695 --> 00:36:01.281
give them a quiet room or somewhere,
where they can watch or have that content,

00:36:01.365 --> 00:36:03.209
where they can watch it from home.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.398
Again, it takes doing things
in different formats and in different ways

00:36:07.418 --> 00:36:09.775
that you may not be used to,
to make it as accessible,

00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:11.618
and it's open to
as many people as possible.

00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:14.785
I think we always try to plan the events
that we like,

00:36:14.888 --> 00:36:16.506
but I always try to think of

00:36:16.598 --> 00:36:20.370
how someone else would need
to consume that information.

00:36:20.626 --> 00:36:24.554
Again, making ASL captioning
part of every event

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.379
and have it fully funded
would be my suggestion.

00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:29.398
Sherose: I hear you,
and I hear what you mean

00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:31.476
when you say, like,
if you could snap your fingers

00:36:31.497 --> 00:36:32.933
and make that mandatory.

00:36:33.062 --> 00:36:39.383
I wonder, with the ADA Title II ruling
that goes into effect in April,

00:36:39.548 --> 00:36:45.352
that's just in the United States,
that applies to state entities,

00:36:45.428 --> 00:36:47.510
like higher education,
government offices.

00:36:47.618 --> 00:36:53.381
I wonder if that'll initiate
or at least, start--

00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:55.132
initiate, yes, initiate's the word.

00:36:55.159 --> 00:36:59.553
I'm thinking momentum
towards a culture change to that effect.

00:36:59.616 --> 00:37:03.800
I feel like what you're describing here
doesn't seem like

00:37:04.277 --> 00:37:06.582
that what you do
is complicated, really.

00:37:06.606 --> 00:37:09.165
It's just thoughtful, right?

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:10.782
Yes, so it's doable.

00:37:10.954 --> 00:37:12.799
Joe: Yes,
and I think just making people,

00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:15.344
and I think people
that are here today,

00:37:15.874 --> 00:37:18.818
all of the content or all the information
that you're receiving,

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.134
you take that back to your community
or your projects or the people

00:37:22.154 --> 00:37:24.524
that you interact with,
and just being aware

00:37:24.544 --> 00:37:27.204
and making other people aware
is the first step.

00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:30.465
You also have the knowledge
of doing specific things

00:37:30.486 --> 00:37:31.522
that can make a difference.

00:37:31.558 --> 00:37:34.006
Then one of the things
that I really enjoyed about,

00:37:34.088 --> 00:37:38.360
like in talking about my journey,
and I do it in a dramatic way,

00:37:38.524 --> 00:37:42.743
was I wanted to get in those rooms
to help make those decisions,

00:37:42.763 --> 00:37:44.819
because I was thinking
about that stuff all the time.

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:48.047
Like, when we did
our WordCamps back locally,

00:37:48.213 --> 00:37:51.056
those are things that
I took to the flagship level.

00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:54.127
Just being in the room
and armed with this knowledge

00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:55.455
can make a big difference.

00:37:55.476 --> 00:37:57.345
Sherose: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:37:57.367 --> 00:37:58.979
Okay,
I'll move on to the next question.

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:03.279
What tips do you have
for small local events like meetups?

00:38:03.722 --> 00:38:06.154
-I feel like [crosstalk]
-it goes back.

00:38:06.175 --> 00:38:09.822
Joe: It was funny, because each question
that came in, it's the same thing,

00:38:09.843 --> 00:38:11.047
especially now,

00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:14.184
as budgets are tightening
and things like that.

00:38:14.344 --> 00:38:18.566
There should be a baseline
for providing certain things.

00:38:18.787 --> 00:38:20.716
If you really want people
to learn WordPress

00:38:20.736 --> 00:38:22.364
and learn about accessibility,

00:38:22.476 --> 00:38:24.764
you have to have all the tools available.

00:38:24.864 --> 00:38:28.251
Making it as open
and inclusive as possible

00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:30.391
is a big thing.

00:38:30.455 --> 00:38:35.432
I know in our community in Santa Clarita,
there's a couple of incredible people

00:38:35.465 --> 00:38:40.168
that I always shout out that made,
brought accessibility to everyone's mind,

00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:42.925
and so everything that we do
and think about

00:38:43.502 --> 00:38:45.948
has that accessibility slant.

00:38:47.655 --> 00:38:50.067
Yes, so I would say
just try to keep the pressure on,

00:38:50.087 --> 00:38:52.494
and I think that leads
into our next question.

00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:59.234
Try to make it second nature
and making people commit to it.

00:39:00.434 --> 00:39:04.993
Sherose: I think for that question,
though, it leads into essentially, like,

00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:07.046
higher level buy-in, right?

00:39:07.058 --> 00:39:10.788
Like, you could be the organizer,

00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:14.578
but what kind of problems
would someone who is, like,

00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:16.901
let's say on a committee to organize,

00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:19.105
what kind of things
would they might face as a budget?

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.658
They might not have control over it.

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:26.537
What would be, like considerations?

00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:30.674
What is a pitch essentially to--

00:39:30.694 --> 00:39:31.586
What is the pressure?

00:39:31.606 --> 00:39:33.034
How do you articulate that?

00:39:33.481 --> 00:39:38.350
Joe: Well, for me, and I didn't want to be
the pain in the butt,

00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:41.359
it's to just be a part of the conversation
as early as possible.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.903
I think a lot of times

00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:47.474
when you're getting near a month out
or six weeks out,

00:39:47.584 --> 00:39:51.533
that could be too late
to make the kind of impact

00:39:51.553 --> 00:39:53.292
that you really need
for your audience.

00:39:53.313 --> 00:39:56.328
Again, at the beginning of the process,
I was asking,

00:39:56.348 --> 00:39:59.732
hey, you're thinking of doing video,
are we going to do this?

00:39:59.798 --> 00:40:02.821
One of the things that I wanted to do
at WordCamp US

00:40:02.841 --> 00:40:04.201
the last time I was an organizer

00:40:04.221 --> 00:40:07.274
was to make sure that
on every stage there was a ramp.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.495
Make sure that every stage
had a large screen next to it

00:40:10.515 --> 00:40:13.855
with the captioning right there
next to the person,

00:40:13.876 --> 00:40:16.784
because a lot of times,
you'll only see a screen with slides,

00:40:16.804 --> 00:40:17.977
but you won't see,

00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:20.452
there may be a tiny bit
at the top or the bottom.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.069
I was just trying to make things
as present and as big as possible.

00:40:24.284 --> 00:40:27.441
Again, I was in the room,
and from the very beginning, I was like,

00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:28.795
hey, I want to be in on the tour.

00:40:28.815 --> 00:40:29.908
I want to help here.

00:40:29.924 --> 00:40:31.328
I want to do this.

00:40:31.937 --> 00:40:32.965
As early as possible

00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:36.418
and as much possible pressure
that you can put on this,

00:40:36.438 --> 00:40:38.101
not really like pressure, pressure,

00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:40.538
but as long as you're part
of the discussion,

00:40:40.665 --> 00:40:41.744
that can make a difference.

00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:43.800
Sherose: A figure of speech
I always hear is,

00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:46.868
the squeaky wheel gets the grease,
and that means that

00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:49.756
whatever's making the most noise
gets the attention.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.086
I can see how it makes sense,
even if you're not at an organizer level,

00:40:54.106 --> 00:40:56.211
that if you see something
that could be made better

00:40:56.232 --> 00:40:59.540
to go ahead and say something
about it as soon as you notice,

00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:02.133
and work to protect it.

00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:04.016
Joe: Plus, you can leverage.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.912
A lot of the people that are organizing
at the lead level,

00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:08.997
they've seen and done
a lot of this stuff.

00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:14.331
One of the cool things was that
during US, I was suggesting things,

00:41:14.352 --> 00:41:18.459
and one of the team members suggested,
hey, you could do captions this way

00:41:18.644 --> 00:41:20.317
in a way that I hadn't thought of.

00:41:20.356 --> 00:41:22.734
Again, it's not an adversarial position.

00:41:22.754 --> 00:41:23.936
Really it's a collaboration.

00:41:23.956 --> 00:41:25.527
I love jazz music.

00:41:25.647 --> 00:41:29.121
I think of all this stuff
that I do as collaborating with people

00:41:29.175 --> 00:41:30.278
that are talented.

00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.451
I think if I'm working
with John Coltrane

00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:36.081
on this or Dizzy Gillespie
on that kind of thing.

00:41:36.398 --> 00:41:40.114
To me, I always come in with that level
of learning or wanting to learn,

00:41:40.186 --> 00:41:43.351
as well as just collaborating with people
that I could learn from.

00:41:43.478 --> 00:41:47.220
Sherose: Those are flattering comparisons,
Joe, very flattering.

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:50.699
Another question we have,
and we have time for a few more,

00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:52.667
if someone's thinking of questions,

00:41:53.056 --> 00:41:54.593
what is the most practical way

00:41:54.613 --> 00:41:58.917
to handle live captioning
for small, low budget events?

00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:02.181
Joe: Right,
and I saw that by Amber as well.

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:06.074
One of the things, and it's not ideal,

00:42:06.095 --> 00:42:09.442
but again, it's like patching it
together.

00:42:10.254 --> 00:42:12.958
It does take a little bit
of rolling your sleeves up,

00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:14.070
elbow grease,

00:42:14.224 --> 00:42:17.610
like if you're in a Zoom session
on your Meetup, for example,

00:42:17.696 --> 00:42:20.882
I usually use a captioning
that's on Zoom now.

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.283
It'll record a transcript,

00:42:23.317 --> 00:42:26.779
or the AI does a transcript
of the meeting summary.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:31.168
The transcript, I saved that down
when you record the video,

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:36.153
and then I proofread it and tweak it,
so that it's more accurate.

00:42:36.216 --> 00:42:39.739
Because one of the downsides
to live captioning or using caption

00:42:39.828 --> 00:42:42.649
is that it makes a lot of "craptions"
or mistakes.

00:42:42.974 --> 00:42:46.311
I try to go in and clean that up
and then bundle that with the video

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:52.513
to provide an accurate captioning
for the video.

00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:55.721
Most of us don't have a sponsor
or budget.

00:42:56.257 --> 00:42:59.172
That's the low budget version of it.

00:42:59.557 --> 00:43:01.253
Ideally, if we had a sponsor

00:43:01.273 --> 00:43:03.373
involved with our group
or something like that,

00:43:03.456 --> 00:43:06.241
I try to lean on them
to get a little more money

00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:09.025
so that we can have
actual professionals do it.

00:43:09.513 --> 00:43:10.786
Sherose: Yes, that makes sense.

00:43:10.977 --> 00:43:13.447
I feel like if you're organizing
something with,

00:43:13.474 --> 00:43:16.134
again, no sponsor, no budget,
it's the first time

00:43:16.154 --> 00:43:17.715
and you got to prove yourself,

00:43:17.738 --> 00:43:20.543
you may have to rely
on automatic captioning.

00:43:20.563 --> 00:43:23.516
Zoom's automatic captioning,
I would say, is better and better

00:43:23.529 --> 00:43:24.716
every time I check it out.

00:43:24.736 --> 00:43:26.984
They get my name right,
which is challenging.

00:43:27.029 --> 00:43:30.569
That's how I judge
any automatic captions ability.

00:43:31.601 --> 00:43:34.194
Yes, you're right.
Then afterwards, sharing this,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.259
and that actually leads me
to my next question.

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.294
You've shared
a ton of proactive strategies.

00:43:38.374 --> 00:43:40.100
You mentioned a few things
to do afterwards,

00:43:40.208 --> 00:43:46.982
but could you expand a bit on
what post-event things folks can do?

00:43:47.492 --> 00:43:49.312
Joe: Oh, after the event.

00:43:50.191 --> 00:43:53.193
With WordCamp generally take,

00:43:53.343 --> 00:43:57.253
as an organizer, most local events,

00:43:57.273 --> 00:43:59.569
they tell you to plan
six months in advance.

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:03.062
Or like on the flagship level,
they usually start a year out.

00:44:03.178 --> 00:44:04.408
The first thing I would do is

00:44:04.428 --> 00:44:08.385
once you'll do like a recap
at the end of the meeting,

00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:09.679
try to have that as soon as possible

00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:12.344
and get as much information
from surveys,

00:44:12.364 --> 00:44:14.571
attendees as possible.

00:44:14.591 --> 00:44:19.598
One of the coolest experiences
I had at US, in National Harbor was,

00:44:19.687 --> 00:44:22.232
I was walking around the sponsor area.

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.468
There was a gentleman

00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:26.579
that we just struck up a conversation
outside one of the exhibits.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.589
He was saying, I really wish
I could have gone to the after party,

00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:32.299
but the music was too loud.

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:35.097
It would have been really cool
if they had a quiet space nearby

00:44:35.117 --> 00:44:36.753
so I could fill a part of the group.

00:44:37.151 --> 00:44:38.151
To me,

00:44:38.258 --> 00:44:42.094
once you do a recap
after your Meetup or your event,

00:44:42.158 --> 00:44:44.900
just make sure you try to take
as many notes as possible.

00:44:45.586 --> 00:44:47.576
I'm here in Ottawa right now
for WordCamp Canada,

00:44:47.596 --> 00:44:50.305
and I've just been going around
talking to people about

00:44:50.424 --> 00:44:52.999
things that I want
to incorporate in my next event.

00:44:53.898 --> 00:44:55.371
That's the way I try to be proactive.

00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:57.503
I make a wish list.

00:44:57.523 --> 00:45:00.114
I try to take in
any complaints or concerns,

00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:02.574
and I try to leverage that
and use it next time.

00:45:03.633 --> 00:45:06.837
I try to do that as far
in advance as possible.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.767
I also reach out to members
of the foundation

00:45:09.788 --> 00:45:12.438
or someone that's going
to be a prospective mentor

00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:14.781
and get their input
on things as well.

00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:16.701
Sherose: Yes,
so what I'm hearing from you is like,

00:45:16.772 --> 00:45:21.614
aside from sharing content afterwards,
you're also saying

00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:24.974
that it would be ideal to follow up
with attendees

00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:31.215
and to be paying attention
during the events to note issues,

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.549
and to spread that work out
across your team.

00:45:35.798 --> 00:45:42.107
Joe: Yes. One thing I try never to do
is like a lot of times as an organizer,

00:45:42.861 --> 00:45:44.185
you may feel like it's a lot of stress

00:45:44.205 --> 00:45:46.335
and you don't want
to hear people complain,

00:45:46.415 --> 00:45:48.405
but you really need to be available

00:45:48.425 --> 00:45:50.786
and to be open to criticism,

00:45:50.806 --> 00:45:52.163
but also to make sure

00:45:52.183 --> 00:45:53.146
that you're going to act on it

00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.324
and make sure that you reassure
that person that, hey,

00:45:56.423 --> 00:45:57.947
your comments are important,

00:45:58.265 --> 00:46:00.550
your concerns are important,
and we're going to act on them

00:46:00.574 --> 00:46:02.312
when we have the opportunity to.

00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:03.376
Sherose: Yes.

00:46:03.396 --> 00:46:05.726
Thank you. I want to just go back one,

00:46:05.746 --> 00:46:08.649
when we were talking about
like a live captioning.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.668
The follow-up question was like
specifically though for live events,

00:46:11.688 --> 00:46:14.367
how are we doing live captioning
in a practical way?

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.978
I wanted to add my answer,

00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:19.311
and Joe, you can answer this as well.

00:46:19.502 --> 00:46:22.338
Finding a live captioner
and negotiating with them

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:24.922
is pretty much what you can do.

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.623
My institution works frequently
with several vendors.

00:46:27.643 --> 00:46:31.138
The one we work with most often
is 3Play

00:46:31.758 --> 00:46:32.903
We have a contract with them

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:36.576
that allows us to negotiate
a different rate

00:46:36.825 --> 00:46:39.921
that would be more expensive
if it was just one thing

00:46:39.941 --> 00:46:41.780
that they live captioned for us.

00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:43.474
Sherose: That was my advice.
Joe: Oh, that's awesome.

00:46:43.488 --> 00:46:44.385
Sherose: Yes.

00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:46.549
I'm really not sure
because if you're low budget,

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:48.507
it's a common situation.

00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:51.383
I imagine if someone
wants to work with you,

00:46:51.403 --> 00:46:53.488
they'll find a way to make that work.

00:46:53.886 --> 00:46:57.024
Joe: I'll find out this go around,
like I mentioned in my slides,

00:46:57.044 --> 00:46:59.431
we're going to do
a WordCamp Santa Clarita.

00:46:59.463 --> 00:47:03.928
Back in the previous events
that I've done as an organizer,

00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:07.064
there was White Coat Captioning
for all of our events,

00:47:07.084 --> 00:47:08.483
and that was part of the budget.

00:47:08.715 --> 00:47:09.960
I don't know how it works.

00:47:10.029 --> 00:47:12.022
Moving forward,
I'll find out a little bit more tomorrow

00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:14.342
when I talk to the WordCamp
Canada folks.

00:47:14.897 --> 00:47:17.149
You'll have that baseline level,
but like I said,

00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:20.137
it would be great to have
someone ASL on stage.

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:24.781
Ideally, just imagine
if Matt's State of the Word

00:47:24.834 --> 00:47:29.108
or his town hall had someone
on stage doing ASL,

00:47:29.128 --> 00:47:30.383
that would be incredible.

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:35.249
That level of accessibility is something
that I hope for one day.

00:47:36.692 --> 00:47:39.017
Again, those are things
that I hope happens,

00:47:39.078 --> 00:47:43.172
but having a baseline that
you could build on is very important.

00:47:43.472 --> 00:47:45.169
Sherose: I've got about 20 seconds,

00:47:45.189 --> 00:47:47.128
so I'm going to try
to read this quickly,

00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:50.149
and I want you to answer it
with whatever time I leave you.

00:47:50.332 --> 00:47:54.993
Can you share an in-person event
that was well prepared for accessibility?

00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:57.274
Same question for online event.

00:47:57.518 --> 00:47:59.268
Good luck, 20 seconds.

00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:04.779
Joe: Well, I would say the last time
around at WordCamp US,

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.073
I felt like we did a pretty good job.

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:11.292
Generally during a WordCamp,
there are certain teams.

00:48:11.333 --> 00:48:14.272
We had an accessibility team,
which is a brand new team.

00:48:14.736 --> 00:48:17.521
Like I said, Michelle Frechette
was on team, Alex Stein.

00:48:17.617 --> 00:48:21.205
We tried to incorporate people
whose voices were out in the community,

00:48:21.286 --> 00:48:25.325
sometimes in a negative way to try
to help build a better experience.

00:48:25.801 --> 00:48:29.074
I would say
that was probably the best one,

00:48:29.105 --> 00:48:32.188
and hopefully my next one
will be the best one.

00:48:32.241 --> 00:48:34.770
Sherose: Excellent, and then
I'll just pitch for an online event

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:35.987
to answer that question.

00:48:36.357 --> 00:48:39.370
WordPress Accessibility Day
is very welcome.

00:48:39.437 --> 00:48:42.125
Joe: Oh, and I was getting--,
and I always give props,

00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:44.308
Amber is doing
so many incredible things.

00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:45.404
Like she's been everywhere.

00:48:45.706 --> 00:48:48.690
I'm so looking forward
to her conversation with Matt,

00:48:48.937 --> 00:48:52.154
because it's sort of everything
full circle. [crosstalk]

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.025
Sherose: Right.
She's really doing quite a bit.

00:48:54.153 --> 00:48:56.688
