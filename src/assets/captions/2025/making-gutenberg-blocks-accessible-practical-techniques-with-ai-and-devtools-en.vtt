Welcome, Anam.

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:03.619
<v ANAM HOSSAIN> Hi, I'm Anam.

00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:08.835
Today, I'm going to talk about
Making Gutenberg Block Accessible.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.964
In this session,
I will share some practical tips

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:15.335
and techniques with DevTools and AI.

00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:17.838
Let's get started.

00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:24.910
Why at first, I wanted to say
that why accessibility matters.

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:28.632
When we come in to tell

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:32.318
about why accessibility matters,

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.353
we are actually not just
thinking about

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:35.721
the people with disabilities,

00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:40.259
we are also thinking about
better usability for all users.

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:45.631
Around 15% of global population
lives with some form of disabilities.

00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:48.234
Accessibility is also about
compliance

00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:52.571
with standards like WCAG and ADA.

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.206
Most importantly,

00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:58.095
it is actually creating
some inclusive experience.

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.883
Good accessibility
that means good usability.

00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:04.753
Apart from that,

00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:08.621
when we are actually coming
to the people,

00:04:08.622 --> 00:04:10.489
it is not just about the code,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.390
it actually caring about the people.

00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:17.265
When you are actually implementing

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:21.300
or your site
is good at accessible level,

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:24.136
so then you are actually
good in business.

00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:29.809
Improve your site SEO and you reach

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.079
to the more audience,
you actually reduce

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.719
your site legal risk because in USA

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:42.955
there are some legal issue
regarding the accessibility.

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:48.762
You reduce some I can say,
legal risk.

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:53.766
At last but not least, actually,

00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:57.670
I can say accessibility
is all about mindset.

00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:59.654
It's not about the task.

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.575
When you are actually having
accessibility

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:06.178
in your mindset as a developer,
when you are writing your code,

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:12.651
when you are writing in a div,
actually, you can think about

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:16.522
should I write div
or should I write button

00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:19.959
because the functionality
of this section

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.522
of this element will be button.

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:27.343
Instead of writing div,
we can actually writing some button.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.937
When we are actually adding
some image, then at that level,

00:05:31.938 --> 00:05:36.275
when you are actually keep
accessibility in your mind,

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:40.446
then you must add
some alternative text

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:43.257
that describe that image properly.

00:05:44.918 --> 00:05:47.653
Actually I can say
from the developer perspective,

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:51.257
I can say it's all accessibility
is something like mindset.

00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:53.241
It's not about the task.

00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:56.629
When you are actually writing
your code day-to-day basis,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.169
you are actually writing
accessible code

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:02.935
when accessibility in your mindset.

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:06.739
I can say from the developer
perspective, it's your mindset.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.341
You can set
your mindset as accessible

00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:14.314
so that you can write
your code mostly accessible way.

00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:16.549
Let me introduce myself.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.683
I am Anam.

00:06:17.684 --> 00:06:20.186
I am a senior WordPress
engineer at Multidots,

00:06:20.187 --> 00:06:22.688
which is WordPress VIP agency.

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:24.625
I have been building custom solution

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:27.526
for more than nine and a half years.

00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:31.564
Most of the case,
I write some Gutenberg block

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:33.631
with more accessible way.

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:37.636
In this session,
I will share some more accessible way

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.471
or more practical tips and techniques

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:46.045
regarding the Gutenberg blocks
and how accessibility can improve

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:48.914
or how these things
needed to be tested,

00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:51.717
or how these things
needed to be implemented.

00:06:51.718 --> 00:06:53.398
Let's get started.

00:06:55.488 --> 00:06:59.792
In this session,
I will cover some semantic HTML;

00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:01.861
and ARIA roles – how ARIA roles

00:07:01.862 --> 00:07:04.463
can be implemented
or what is the main purpose

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.901
of ARIA roles;
and keyboard accessibility,

00:07:09.736 --> 00:07:13.175
because few of the people
are actually navigate

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:17.343
through the keyboard,
like they can navigate

00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:21.714
or your site can be navigate
order by order

00:07:21.715 --> 00:07:23.682
through the keyboard accessibility;

00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:26.162
and some colour contrast ratio.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:33.125
If your site visitor
having some colour

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:34.680
blindness or colour issue,

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:38.796
then when you are developing
your site

00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:43.269
or when you are designing your site,
you must keep

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.971
this colour contrast
ratio in your mind,

00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:51.110
because if you choose
some wrong colour for wrong people,

00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:55.214
then they might not get
interested for your website.

00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:57.850
You must keep colour contrast ratio

00:07:57.851 --> 00:08:02.087
when you are actually building
or developing

00:08:02.088 --> 00:08:04.356
your site or designing your site.

00:08:04.357 --> 00:08:07.259
Then the next thing
is alternative text.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.996
Alternative text
is also the same level

00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:13.365
important as the colour
contrast ratio,

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:17.569
because it actually
describe the image issue

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.004
for the screen readers.

00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:20.572
When any screen reader came

00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:25.344
to your image
and they actually describe

00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:28.180
the image in the text level.

00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:30.082
It is also important.

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:36.222
A visitor can get
some idea for your image.

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:38.960
The next topic is DevTools.

00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:43.062
DevTools is also important
for the developer perspective.

00:08:43.063 --> 00:08:47.866
How DevTools can be used
to maintain accessible things,

00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:50.937
and AI can be used in DevTools.

00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:53.505
I will cover these things
in my session.

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:58.011
Let's get to the next topic.

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:02.581
The first thing first,
which is semantic HTML,

00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:05.994
which is the most
important part, I can say.

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:09.548
Most people actually ignore this part

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:13.068
because they are focusing
about the design,

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.060
not focusing about the markup.

00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:16.595
When you are actually focusing about

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:21.266
the markup, you are having some SEO,

00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:24.036
like at that time
you are actually focusing

00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:30.676
the SEO and focusing
actually more markup

00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:35.686
or how the markup can be improved

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.302
with the semantic HTML.

00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:44.561
It actually meaning that

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:47.659
put the right things
in the right place.

00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:52.464
When you are actually writing
like the div or something like that,

00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:57.436
when you are actually developing
any page with a coding level.

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:01.040
Instead of writing
div for your header,

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:05.477
writing div for your navigation,
writing div for your button,

00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:09.548
then you can actually
think about this like,

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:11.450
for the header, it can be header.

00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:12.530
For the navigation,

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.320
if you are actually using
writing navigation,

00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:16.822
then it can be navigation,

00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:19.324
or even you are actually writing
some button,

00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:23.629
then instead of div,
you can actually use button.

00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:30.436
In this way, you can actually
differentiate right markup

00:10:30.437 --> 00:10:34.506
or semantic HTML instead of div.

00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:40.079
The next thing is choose
your heading logically.

00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:42.797
All the heading in your page,

00:10:42.798 --> 00:10:48.921
not for the same
importantness or same priority.

00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:54.093
You should use h1
for the most important title,

00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:58.764
then h2, then h3,
then h4, then h5, then h6.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:02.652
You need to choose
your heading logically.

00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:10.042
Sorry, so avoid the divs.

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:16.949
Some developer use
div most of the places.

00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:19.718
Avoid use div most of the places.

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:23.002
There are some most HTML
element in there

00:11:23.003 --> 00:11:27.326
like aside, footer, main, article.

00:11:27.527 --> 00:11:31.397
You can use those type
of element instead of div.

00:11:31.898 --> 00:11:37.803
This is the common,
simple example of, I can say

00:11:37.804 --> 00:11:41.440
the template part of the team.

00:11:42.142 --> 00:11:46.111
Here, you can use
header instead of div.

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:47.930
We can use navigation.

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:53.619
If you are actually using navigation,
then you can use nav,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.387
then footer for the site-footer.

00:11:55.388 --> 00:11:58.027
These are the things
you can actually implement

00:11:58.028 --> 00:12:02.628
as a semantic HTML instead
of div or some other things.

00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:05.364
Put the right things
into the right place

00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:08.258
then it will improve automatically.

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.441
The next thing is ARIA.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:19.978
The ARIA means
Accessible Rich Internet Application.

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:25.057
It defined the most important part,
which part define which part.

00:12:25.218 --> 00:12:28.854
If you define any place
or if you define

00:12:28.855 --> 00:12:34.626
any ARIA as a navigation,
then it can be count as a navigation.

00:12:34.627 --> 00:12:39.565
If you define any ARIA as a main,
then it will be count

00:12:39.566 --> 00:12:42.045
as a main content of the page.

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:48.106
You need to set your ARIA
label or ARIA role accordingly.

00:12:49.576 --> 00:12:55.147
Don't overuse it, but you need
to set these things clearly.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:00.547
Sorry.

00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:03.722
For example, if I go into the ARIA,

00:13:03.723 --> 00:13:07.928
how the ARIA can be described,
this is the navigation.

00:13:09.462 --> 00:13:13.599
Instead of div, we can use nav,
and this is the label.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.469
We can use this label
as a main navigation,

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:24.476
and then we don't have any search
element in HTML.

00:13:24.477 --> 00:13:26.378
We can use div and set

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:30.015
the role and the label
for the Site Search,

00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:34.856
then in the main content,
we can set the role as main content.

00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:37.789
In this way, we can actually use

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.627
the aria-label and aria-role,
and we can go

00:13:41.628 --> 00:13:45.498
into the code for more explore.

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:48.528
I can say this is one of the--

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:49.818
not this one.

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:50.936
This one.

00:13:53.306 --> 00:13:57.710
In this page,
this is some tab functionality.

00:13:58.845 --> 00:14:04.850
I can say here it is if I go
into the English, American,

00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:08.720
so the respective things
will show the respective category.

00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:13.025
These are the category of this site,
and respective post

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.527
will be assigned
to the respective category.

00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:18.421
If I open the code of this section,

00:14:19.732 --> 00:14:24.602
save.js, so here you can notice,

00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:27.005
which is like this one.

00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:33.011
In this, in here,
this nav will represent this one.

00:14:33.012 --> 00:14:38.950
In nav, I can say that
the aria-label I actually define,

00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:41.182
which is the category tabs.

00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:44.756
If I define something else,
then it will define

00:14:44.757 --> 00:14:48.126
like what is the main
purpose of this nav.

00:14:48.361 --> 00:14:50.262
In this way, we can actually define

00:14:50.263 --> 00:14:53.900
the ARIA of that specific section.

00:14:56.602 --> 00:15:00.966
When it is come to the content,
which is like this part.

00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:03.975
Here is something like aria-hidden.

00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:06.645
Right now, the classic part,

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:10.182
classic category post
is visible, but rest

00:15:11.317 --> 00:15:13.879
of the category post is hidden.

00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:17.656
We can say it this way: aria-expanded

00:15:17.657 --> 00:15:20.593
or aria-hidden, then aria-labelledby.

00:15:21.194 --> 00:15:25.497
We can add these things
into our block label

00:15:25.498 --> 00:15:30.736
to describe properly what ARIA
is responsible for what things.

00:15:30.737 --> 00:15:35.508
Is it hidden or is it expanded,
some of like that.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:42.414
Some important tips
for the developer, which is at first,

00:15:42.415 --> 00:15:46.885
you think HTML5 tag first,
which is a schema markup.

00:15:46.886 --> 00:15:51.123
If anything is not covered
by the HTML tag,

00:15:51.124 --> 00:15:53.190
then something like this.

00:15:53.993 --> 00:15:59.097
There is no HTML5
element for the search.

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:04.236
You should use
aria-label in this case.

00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:07.005
Don't overuse the aria-label,

00:16:07.006 --> 00:16:10.609
but you can use ARIA
landmark when it is necessary.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.278
If anything is described, you can use

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:17.048
aria-label or aria-labelledby
to clarify the purpose.

00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:18.850
Of course, when it is finished,

00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:21.744
then test the accessibility checker

00:16:22.555 --> 00:16:26.625
to test your plugin or test
your theme functionality.

00:16:26.626 --> 00:16:29.353
This is the ARIA part, I can say.

00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:34.627
Another important thing
which is keyboard accessibility.

00:16:35.768 --> 00:16:41.606
When you are actually developing
any block in Gutenberg,

00:16:41.607 --> 00:16:43.838
then keyboard accessibility

00:16:43.843 --> 00:16:47.780
might come into play,
might be, I can say,

00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:50.749
challenging part in some cases,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.685
but in some cases,
it is not challenging,

00:16:53.686 --> 00:16:59.325
but in some cases,
it is also challenging, I can say.

00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:03.261
When you are actually creating
some complex,

00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:07.766
then the tab functionality
then the click functionality.

00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:09.768
The tab functionality is by default,

00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:11.803
you can actually go through the tab,

00:17:11.804 --> 00:17:16.508
but when you are actually adding
some next and right button

00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:20.846
in your keyboard, then you need
some more functionality.

00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:24.850
I can say all interactive element
in your block must be accessible

00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:27.152
via the keyboard navigation.

00:17:27.153 --> 00:17:28.587
Users should be able to navigate

00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:31.289
through your blocks using
the Tab key or interact

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.622
with the element using
the Enter and Space.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.065
When you are actually having
some button in your block,

00:17:40.066 --> 00:17:43.635
you can actually
do so like this way onKeyDown,

00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:49.074
when either it is Enter,
either it is a Space, you can write

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:51.389
your function like this way.

00:17:51.944 --> 00:17:55.673
Let me demonstrate
how these things can be done.

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:58.752
Here I click in here.

00:17:58.818 --> 00:18:00.853
If I press the Tab,

00:18:01.888 --> 00:18:05.591
it is actually navigate
through one by one.

00:18:08.027 --> 00:18:12.198
Then if I click on the this one,
then if I hit Tab,

00:18:12.431 --> 00:18:16.629
and now I'm pressing next

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.145
and previous keyboard on my keyboard.

00:18:24.377 --> 00:18:26.711
I'm going through the next button

00:18:26.712 --> 00:18:29.648
and going through
the previous button.

00:18:29.982 --> 00:18:36.055
When I choose any category
through the next and previous,

00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:41.693
and hit Enter,
then selected category will be shown.

00:18:41.694 --> 00:18:43.962
Crime, press Enter, Fiction,

00:18:43.963 --> 00:18:48.433
press Enter, French, press Enter,
Nature, press Enter.

00:18:48.434 --> 00:18:52.804
If I go to Fiction
again and press Space,

00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:55.073
then it is also visible.

00:18:55.074 --> 00:19:00.946
Crime, press, Crime, Love,
press Space, Classic, press Space,

00:19:00.947 --> 00:19:02.930
then it is also visible.

00:19:03.015 --> 00:19:05.917
Then if I press Tab again,
then it will go

00:19:05.918 --> 00:19:06.985
through the next and right.

00:19:06.986 --> 00:19:10.889
Or if I press
any next or previous button,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.792
then it will go
through the next thing.

00:19:13.793 --> 00:19:18.096
Then it will focus
to the next highlightable area,

00:19:18.097 --> 00:19:20.494
which is anchor in this case.

00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:24.612
In this way, keyboard
accessible is actually needed.

00:19:25.271 --> 00:19:28.683
Let's go into the code
part of this section,

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:33.546
which is view.js.

00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:41.786
At last of this page,
which is like keydown,

00:19:41.787 --> 00:19:44.589
when you are actually pressing
the keydown,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.493
there is a way to check.

00:19:47.627 --> 00:19:51.730
If it is ArrowRight, which is
the right key of your keyboard,

00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:54.766
then this functionality
will be executed.

00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:59.289
When it is left, then this
functionality will be executed.

00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:03.108
Then there are some other things,

00:20:03.109 --> 00:20:06.412
which is press Enter and press Space.

00:20:08.114 --> 00:20:13.418
This functionality is activate
some like adding some console log

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:16.921
for the debugging purpose,
adding some attributes,

00:20:16.922 --> 00:20:20.254
hidden and true,
expanded, hidden and true.

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:24.496
These things also needed
to be implemented.

00:20:24.497 --> 00:20:27.966
If anything is hidden,
or any area is hidden,

00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:32.638
then you need to add hidden
or expanded in this way.

00:20:33.072 --> 00:20:35.179
These things are needed

00:20:35.219 --> 00:20:37.776
to be implemented
through the keyboard.

00:20:37.777 --> 00:20:41.746
If I go into the another post,
which is this one.

00:20:42.948 --> 00:20:47.786
I can say the full things
are actually in one thing, one card.

00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:50.822
You can count as a card or postcard.

00:20:51.057 --> 00:20:53.224
If I click in here and press tab,

00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:57.229
then the entire things
are actually selected.

00:20:57.997 --> 00:21:00.398
See, the entire things are selected.

00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:01.866
If I press Enter,

00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:05.870
then it actually go
into the respective post.

00:21:05.871 --> 00:21:08.306
See if I click Enter, then it will go

00:21:08.307 --> 00:21:12.036
into the respective
category or respective post.

00:21:12.078 --> 00:21:17.483
This keyboard functionality
is needed for your site.

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:21.519
Then alternative text.

00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:25.623
When any image
is shown in your block,

00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:31.296
then you must add
alternative text for that image.

00:21:34.567 --> 00:21:38.603
In this way, you are actually giving
more context to the user,

00:21:38.604 --> 00:21:43.575
like this image
is actually described this text.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:50.081
Screen reader text or screen
reader user can get more idea

00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:54.586
once you are actually providing
some alternative text to the image.

00:21:54.587 --> 00:21:57.589
If you are having
some decorative image,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.762
some like background image,
if you are having some icon,

00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:05.997
or if you are having
some background image,

00:22:05.998 --> 00:22:07.999
then you don't need to provide

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.070
some description
to that decorative image

00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:14.550
because that is not important.

00:22:18.008 --> 00:22:20.137
You should provide
some alternative text

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:21.646
to some important image.

00:22:21.647 --> 00:22:22.837
For example,

00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:32.891
when you are actually developing
something in this code example here,

00:22:32.892 --> 00:22:37.996
which is like SRC,
which is having some URL,

00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:41.232
alternative text,
which is having some alt text

00:22:41.233 --> 00:22:44.469
that is coming from attributes.

00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:48.406
In the block,
if you are actually give user

00:22:48.407 --> 00:22:51.075
to add some alternative text,

00:22:51.076 --> 00:22:53.578
then in this way, we can actually get

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:56.514
that alternative text
from the attributes.

00:22:56.515 --> 00:23:02.388
Let's get into the code
to having some attributes.

00:23:03.823 --> 00:23:05.357
Here it is.

00:23:05.724 --> 00:23:08.661
If I open the Chrome Dev Tools.

00:23:10.629 --> 00:23:12.130
Yes, here.

00:23:12.898 --> 00:23:16.267
Image, here it is
like alternative text.

00:23:16.502 --> 00:23:19.531
This image,
when we are actually coming

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:22.507
through the tab in the--

00:23:22.508 --> 00:23:27.078
Since this is not actually
implemented.

00:23:30.749 --> 00:23:33.351
Since this image
is not actually selected,

00:23:33.352 --> 00:23:35.987
but I add some alternative text,

00:23:35.988 --> 00:23:39.924
I can add some keyboard
navigation here.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.762
Right now it is not implemented,
but you can actually add

00:23:44.763 --> 00:23:48.234
this sort of functionality
for the good practice.

00:23:49.902 --> 00:23:52.051
When it comes to the code,

00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:57.976
here it is.

00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:03.715
Here, the SRC
which is the featuredImage URL,

00:24:03.716 --> 00:24:05.583
and then alternative text.

00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:09.754
Alternative text is coming from here,
postData._embedded,

00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:12.123
and then featuredmedia,
and then alt_text,

00:24:12.124 --> 00:24:14.934
which is coming from the REST API.

00:24:15.794 --> 00:24:18.529
If the featuredImageText
is not provided,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.232
then I am adding
some fallback message,

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:24.670
which is featured
image for this title.

00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:29.507
If anything is not provided,
then it will be shown in here.

00:24:29.508 --> 00:24:32.343
In this way, we can actually
provide some alternative text.

00:24:32.344 --> 00:24:35.813
If any featured image
is not provided, then we can add

00:24:35.814 --> 00:24:40.285
some fallback here,
like "No featured image found".

00:24:40.753 --> 00:24:45.037
In this way, we can actually
add some alternative text.

00:24:48.227 --> 00:24:52.764
Here, since this is
the most important things,

00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:58.069
like this is the card,
but the card is totally selected,

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.549
but the image is not selected.

00:25:01.674 --> 00:25:05.777
Also, we need to add
some alternative text.

00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:09.180
Since this is implemented,
we can open the featured image.

00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:10.272
Here it is.

00:25:11.116 --> 00:25:12.984
This is the alternative text.

00:25:12.985 --> 00:25:15.587
We can also add some here.

00:25:16.188 --> 00:25:19.758
In this way,
we can add some alternative text.

00:25:21.427 --> 00:25:24.929
Then we go into the colour
contrast ratio.

00:25:25.197 --> 00:25:26.998
Ensure that the text and interactive

00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:30.268
elements have some sufficient
colour contrast ratio.

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:36.808
It needs to be WCAG 2.1 AA,
actually standard.

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:42.914
The right ratio for these things,
which is like 4.5:1.

00:25:43.949 --> 00:25:49.121
The normal text
and the large text will be 3:1.

00:25:50.522 --> 00:25:54.827
Let's go into the other things,
which is like,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.049
if we give our user or give the user

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.369
of the block the ability to set
the colour contrast things,

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.271
then we can do like this way,

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:11.175
this is the colour settings,
user can change the text colour,

00:26:11.176 --> 00:26:13.978
user can change the background colour.

00:26:13.979 --> 00:26:18.016
If anything is having
some colour contrast issue,

00:26:18.017 --> 00:26:20.744
so these things might be helpful.

00:26:22.554 --> 00:26:29.462
Now, if I go into this block,

00:26:29.741 --> 00:26:33.470
so I can check the colour
contrast ratio of this,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.871
I can say, the label.

00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:41.639
Here, I open a tool to check
the colour contrast ratio.

00:26:42.574 --> 00:26:48.981
Right now, I'm checking the tools,

00:26:50.883 --> 00:26:54.585
checking the colour
contrast ratio of this text.

00:26:54.887 --> 00:27:00.059
Right now, these things,
which is here,

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:05.364
the colour of this section is here.

00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:09.767
If I choose the text colour,
this is the text colour,

00:27:09.768 --> 00:27:12.070
and the background is #FFF.

00:27:12.071 --> 00:27:17.420
See, this is small text,

00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:19.610
but the large text is good,

00:27:19.611 --> 00:27:22.785
but for the small text,
it is not enough.

00:27:22.915 --> 00:27:24.015
We need to change.

00:27:24.016 --> 00:27:27.352
If I change it to the more deeper

00:27:28.153 --> 00:27:30.542
or more contrast, more black,

00:27:30.543 --> 00:27:34.025
then it will give
you the good result.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.597
If I choose the colour
contrast like this,

00:27:38.697 --> 00:27:42.934
then it will give you the good score
and it will be accessible

00:27:42.935 --> 00:27:47.238
for the people who is having
some colour contrast issue.

00:27:47.506 --> 00:27:52.028
In this way, we can actually
set the colour contrast ratio.

00:27:52.578 --> 00:27:54.645
There are some other tools to check

00:27:54.646 --> 00:27:58.058
the colour contrast ratio,
which is this one.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.539
You can define your colour here,
and you can check each of them.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:12.564
If you set this one as a background,
and this is the text.

00:28:12.831 --> 00:28:17.268
For this background,
which text colour will be good?

00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:23.107
We can check the score for this colour
or for this background.

00:28:23.108 --> 00:28:24.976
Which colour is good?

00:28:24.977 --> 00:28:30.148
For this colour,
this colour is good enough.

00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:32.984
You can check these things,
or you can put

00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:38.489
your site colour code here,
both text and background,

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.927
and it will give you the result.

00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.440
Let's move into the next part,

00:28:47.366 --> 00:28:50.302
which is handling
the dynamic content.

00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:54.872
When you are having some pagination,

00:28:56.975 --> 00:28:59.677
in that case,
if you want your user to show

00:28:59.678 --> 00:29:03.814
the content without reloading
the page, then it needs

00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:09.254
to be informed that user
for the new content.

00:29:09.521 --> 00:29:11.956
For example,
if you are having some product,

00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:15.359
e-commerce product,
and there is an add to cart.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.861
When you click on that cart,

00:29:16.862 --> 00:29:19.564
there are some adjunct
functionality happen.

00:29:19.565 --> 00:29:23.167
When the product
is added to the cart,

00:29:23.168 --> 00:29:25.587
then you need to inform your user,

00:29:25.588 --> 00:29:29.273
"Hey, this product
is added to the cart."

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:34.245
These type of things
you must need to inform your user.

00:29:34.246 --> 00:29:39.383
Or if you load more content
without reloading the page

00:29:39.384 --> 00:29:41.986
by clicking the "load
more post" button,

00:29:41.987 --> 00:29:47.458
then you need to add
some text or you need to inform

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:53.965
your user for the new
content, I can say.

00:29:56.101 --> 00:29:57.903
Dynamic content.

00:29:59.638 --> 00:30:01.197
If anything is updated,

00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:06.711
then you can actually use
the effect tool to update

00:30:06.712 --> 00:30:09.901
the content
or to inform the user like,

00:30:09.902 --> 00:30:11.515
"Hey, these things are updated,"

00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:16.688
then you can definitely
check the new content.

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:22.793
The main thing is actually
don't leave user confused,

00:30:22.794 --> 00:30:24.762
like if they press any button,

00:30:24.763 --> 00:30:28.332
but they didn't actually
know actually,

00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:31.602
what is the next result
by clicking on this button.

00:30:31.603 --> 00:30:33.437
You need to inform your user;

00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:36.742
don't leave the user confused.

00:30:37.643 --> 00:30:40.512
Then screen reader text.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.315
Before I explain
the screen reader text,

00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:50.389
then I must come into here,
which is like this one.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.395
The entire card is clickable,

00:30:57.396 --> 00:31:02.867
but here I actually add
something in here,

00:31:02.868 --> 00:31:05.678
like "read more about these things".

00:31:05.837 --> 00:31:12.810
It is not about the title,
but when the user come into here

00:31:12.811 --> 00:31:15.446
with some proper voiceover tool,

00:31:15.447 --> 00:31:18.249
then they must actually
read these things,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.818
like "read more about
the ancient temple

00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:24.072
stood as a testament",
something like that.

00:31:27.192 --> 00:31:31.195
In this case,
if you are not having these sort of things,

00:31:31.196 --> 00:31:37.034
like aria-label, then you should use
screen reader text,

00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:42.106
something like when user
click on this or when user come

00:31:42.107 --> 00:31:47.745
to this section, then they must know
what is the main purpose

00:31:47.746 --> 00:31:53.884
of this section or what is the main
thing of this card block.

00:31:54.186 --> 00:31:58.322
If I click on this card
or if I press Enter,

00:31:58.323 --> 00:32:02.942
then what will be the next thing

00:32:02.943 --> 00:32:07.932
if I press Enter
or if I click in here?

00:32:09.067 --> 00:32:11.135
In this way, we can actually add

00:32:11.136 --> 00:32:14.072
some alternative text
in this context.

00:32:22.447 --> 00:32:25.983
The next thing is actually having
some accessibility

00:32:25.984 --> 00:32:28.387
in your AI workflow.

00:32:29.154 --> 00:32:31.990
I can say, yes.

00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:41.199
There are some by default
AI tools in your Chrome.

00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:44.030
For example, in this article,

00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:49.106
if I right-click and ask AI,
this is the default Chrome feature.

00:32:49.107 --> 00:32:54.845
I can ask anything
in these Chrome DevTools, ask AI.

00:32:54.846 --> 00:32:57.549
If I run something like "audit

00:32:59.418 --> 00:33:03.922
this markup for accessibility"

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.991
and press Enter, it will analyse

00:33:06.992 --> 00:33:11.695
the things and tell
you what is the issue,

00:33:11.696 --> 00:33:13.631
what is the good and what is the bad,

00:33:13.632 --> 00:33:16.400
and how can I use aria-labelledby.

00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:19.970
It will add some text
and some suggestion,

00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:23.507
like what can be the next things
you can ask,

00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:26.911
check colour contrast
of the text and background.

00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:29.280
If I click on here, send the things,

00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:32.583
check the colour contrast
of the text and background,

00:33:32.584 --> 00:33:34.804
and it will give
you the right things,

00:33:34.805 --> 00:33:38.423
or it will give
you the right suggestion.

00:33:41.193 --> 00:33:45.229
In this way,
we can use AI tools by default.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.631
Definitely, the ChatGPT,
the Claude is there,

00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:49.767
but this is the Chrome DevTools.

00:33:49.768 --> 00:33:56.768
We can use that for
the more accessibility.

00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:07.341
In this case, I must say
this is something like good to know,

00:34:07.652 --> 00:34:11.555
if you are having some ambiguous
test, like "read more".

00:34:11.556 --> 00:34:12.958
For example,

00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:20.498
for the side categories, if I add
some "Read more" button in here,

00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:24.001
that counts as a actually
ambiguous test.

00:34:24.302 --> 00:34:27.638
When user comes into that,
then a screen reader text

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.201
will read about like "read more".

00:34:30.408 --> 00:34:32.776
The thing is that read
more about what?

00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:34.513
Read more about what?

00:34:34.546 --> 00:34:37.281
If I add "read more" in here, in here,

00:34:37.282 --> 00:34:41.585
and here, so each time
a screen reader comes into here

00:34:41.586 --> 00:34:44.788
and read "read more, read more, read more".

00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:48.158
The thing is that, read
more about what?

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.528
You need to add some more context

00:34:50.529 --> 00:34:53.697
in that "read more",
like read more about this,

00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:56.400
read more about this,
read more about this.

00:34:56.401 --> 00:35:02.673
In this way, you can actually
fix some ambiguous text.

00:35:02.674 --> 00:35:03.999
Empty button.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.176
Empty button is something like...

00:35:06.177 --> 00:35:10.548
The most common example of empty
button, which is hamburger menu.

00:35:10.549 --> 00:35:14.084
In this case,
you can add some screen reader text,

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:15.419
like what is the main purpose

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.255
of this button so that user can know.

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.936
The iFrame button.

00:35:20.358 --> 00:35:25.096
If any iFrame
is not having any title,

00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:27.197
then you can add some title,

00:35:27.198 --> 00:35:29.297
or you can have some aria-label

00:35:29.298 --> 00:35:33.971
so that user can know
this aria is actually responsible

00:35:33.972 --> 00:35:37.608
for these things,
which is having some user

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:39.592
can have some good idea.

00:35:40.412 --> 00:35:43.665
The next thing
is incorrect heading order.

00:35:47.986 --> 00:35:51.855
If I set these things as an h3,

00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:54.491
for example, if I develop some block,

00:35:54.492 --> 00:35:59.430
which is having by default h3,
but by default, that is h1.

00:36:00.532 --> 00:36:04.735
When the browser
is parsing that text,

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:07.838
then at first it will have h1

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:11.013
and then h3,
in between there is no text.

00:36:11.042 --> 00:36:14.145
You need
to have some chronicle order.

00:36:16.414 --> 00:36:17.881
Empty link.

00:36:17.882 --> 00:36:20.017
If you're having some empty link,

00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:25.456
at least you actually
have some screen reader text.

00:36:25.757 --> 00:36:29.586
If you are having any link
that is open in a new tab,

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:33.871
then you should add
aria-label like "opens in a new tab".

00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:39.025
This is something good to know
and good to implement.

00:36:39.471 --> 00:36:42.606
Now it's time to testing.

00:36:46.344 --> 00:36:49.381
At first, we can go through the Jest.

00:36:49.914 --> 00:36:55.487
If I open the DevTool,
I set testing environment here.

00:36:55.553 --> 00:37:02.260
If I open "npm run jest" as a "coverage",

00:37:05.063 --> 00:37:08.273
I write some text regarding some--

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.281
Here it is.

00:37:19.678 --> 00:37:22.930
I write some test
case regarding edit.js

00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.748
of featured block.

00:37:24.749 --> 00:37:29.319
In this case, actually,
there are some functionality needed.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.656
There are some mocking-related
things you must test.

00:37:32.657 --> 00:37:34.723
You must write some tests

00:37:36.327 --> 00:37:38.295
regarding your functionality.

00:37:38.296 --> 00:37:41.899
All of the things
are actually not available

00:37:41.966 --> 00:37:43.867
in the testing purpose.

00:37:44.102 --> 00:37:46.937
In that case,
you need to mock those things.

00:37:46.938 --> 00:37:48.739
This is not part
of the accessibility,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.712
but it is good to write some test

00:37:54.713 --> 00:37:57.915
case regarding accessible things.

00:37:59.017 --> 00:38:01.318
In this case, I write some coverage,

00:38:01.319 --> 00:38:06.317
which is render without crashing,
event handler, toggle control.

00:38:07.125 --> 00:38:09.293
This is something you can write.

00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:15.733
The next part is Playwright,
which is the most important part.

00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:19.349
I write one Playwright test

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:25.275
regarding the feature post.

00:38:26.277 --> 00:38:27.746
Here it is.

00:38:32.517 --> 00:38:36.286
Test, end-to-end, and featured post.

00:38:38.256 --> 00:38:41.960
What it does, I can say,
it will create a page,

00:38:42.327 --> 00:38:45.963
then insert the featured post,
then save the page.

00:38:45.964 --> 00:38:48.232
Then on the front end, it will go

00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:51.001
the navigation through the keyboard.

00:38:51.002 --> 00:38:53.337
If the keyboard
navigation is working,

00:38:53.338 --> 00:38:55.439
then it will pass the test.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.007
Otherwise, it will fail.

00:38:57.008 --> 00:38:58.977
Let's run the test.

00:39:18.696 --> 00:39:19.963
There it is.

00:39:20.732 --> 00:39:26.136
At first, I should say "npx",
then "playwright", then "test".

00:39:26.137 --> 00:39:30.421
Of course, the testing
environment is needed to be set.

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:34.077
I can say that is
the different context.

00:39:34.813 --> 00:39:38.549
I just wanted to test
the accessible test.

00:39:40.118 --> 00:39:43.086
When the block is inserted,
then it will go

00:39:43.087 --> 00:39:47.558
through navigation and go
through the tab navigation or not.

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:50.448
If I run into this test,
it will open a new pop-up

00:39:50.449 --> 00:39:53.765
and go through one by one.

00:39:55.366 --> 00:39:58.669
It will open a new pop-up,
log into my dashboard, create a page,

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.704
search for the featured post,

00:40:00.705 --> 00:40:03.407
insert into the block, save the post,

00:40:03.408 --> 00:40:05.642
copy the page URL, and then log in.

00:40:05.643 --> 00:40:09.112
Then see, I didn't do anything,

00:40:09.113 --> 00:40:11.014
but it is actually
going through the tab

00:40:11.015 --> 00:40:14.751
and navigate
through the link by link.

00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:18.581
If everything it is actually go
through the post,

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:22.259
and then at last,
it will delete the page.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.354
See, all the things
are actually passed.

00:40:25.563 --> 00:40:27.397
In this way, we can actually test

00:40:27.398 --> 00:40:30.635
the tab functionality of your block.

00:40:31.369 --> 00:40:33.937
Playwright is actually having
the good tool.

00:40:33.938 --> 00:40:38.610
You can use this way
to test your tab functionality

00:40:39.444 --> 00:40:41.879
or keyboard functionality, I can say.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.816
That is the Playwright testing thing.

00:40:45.049 --> 00:40:49.571
Some other tools which is available,
like Chrome DevTools.

00:40:50.054 --> 00:40:53.657
I can say in the Chrome DevTools,

00:40:53.658 --> 00:40:56.026
open the Chrome DevTools Lighthouse.

00:40:56.027 --> 00:40:57.828
I can choose desktop or mobile.

00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:02.199
I can choose accessibility,
analyse the page load.

00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:05.535
It will give
you the accessibility test.

00:41:05.803 --> 00:41:09.592
If you are having some issue,
then it will show you

00:41:09.593 --> 00:41:13.163
what is the main things
of your accessibility.

00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:16.747
The next thing can be axe DevTools,

00:41:16.748 --> 00:41:19.650
screen readers,
and keyboard-only testing.

00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:24.488
You can also use
the accessibility things

00:41:24.489 --> 00:41:26.423
by default coming from Mac.

00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:31.184
You can use that things,
but these are the tools you can use.

00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:34.698
That's it for this session.

00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:38.268
If you have any question,
let me know.

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:39.269
Thank you.

00:41:41.405 --> 00:41:44.295
<v Annabelle> Thank you so much, Anam,

00:41:44.455 --> 00:41:46.548
for that really great presentation.

00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:49.464
Just a reminder to everybody
that if you'd like

00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:51.694
to ask anything of Anam,

00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:55.669
he is right here and available
just for the next few minutes.

00:41:56.178 --> 00:41:59.388
You can write your questions
in the Q&amp;A section.

00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:03.679
I have got a question here, Anam,
if you're available.

00:42:04.418 --> 00:42:10.076
The first one is that David said
that he noticed you have GraphQL

00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:12.558
installed on your WordPress site.

00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:16.189
Could you tell us a little bit
about what you use it for?

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.747
<v Anam> Can you hear me?

00:42:21.478 --> 00:42:23.482
<v Annabelle> Yes.

00:42:25.097 --> 00:42:27.927
<v Anam> Thank you for asking this question.

00:42:27.927 --> 00:42:30.488
Actually, GraphQL
is not for accessibility,

00:42:30.628 --> 00:42:35.000
but you can use it for creating your post.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.999
I can say it will open
some post-related stuff.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.189
So when you are creating your own block,
you can fetch those posts

00:42:48.239 --> 00:42:49.269
using the GraphQL.

00:42:49.509 --> 00:42:52.059
I use GraphQL
for headless WordPress mostly,

00:42:52.348 --> 00:42:56.178
but GraphQL is not a part of this part.

00:42:56.568 --> 00:43:01.028
I installed the WordPress default
GraphQL plugin

00:43:01.058 --> 00:43:06.069
for my own learning purpose,
but that is another thing.

00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:08.589
<v Annabelle> Great.

00:43:09.278 --> 00:43:10.838
David has another question as well.

00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:16.839
What resources can you suggest to learn
how to create your own Gutenberg blocks?

00:43:19.298 --> 00:43:22.486
<v Anam> By default, WordPress
provides a few of the things,

00:43:22.487 --> 00:43:26.167
like block-related resource.

00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:29.801
I can say the developer WordPress.org [unintelligible]
is a block editor.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.527
Resource is there, and there are
some good GitHub example is there.

00:43:34.787 --> 00:43:40.539
You can check those GitHub repo
for learning the Gutenberg-related stuff.

00:43:40.772 --> 00:43:46.179
WordPress have good documentation
regarding the Gutenberg-related stuff.

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:48.789
That is the best part I can say

00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:53.889
to getting started
for the Gutenberg development.

00:43:55.739 --> 00:43:58.590
<v Annabelle> Can you give some details
on that testing tool that you were using?

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.940
Anis is asking.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.000
<v Anam> Thanks for asking.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:08.018
At first, you need to set
some testing environment,

00:44:08.019 --> 00:44:09.019
I can say.

00:44:09.059 --> 00:44:12.171
Regarding the visual-related stuff,
WordPress suggests Playwright,

00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:15.271
and WordPress have good documentation
regarding the Playwright.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:20.318
You can follow those steps
in the WordPress documentation.

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.549
You have those links.

00:44:21.985 --> 00:44:22.985
Set those up,

00:44:23.138 --> 00:44:27.729
but the things I write,
which is tab-related functionality,

00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:31.419
so you can write it manually regarding
your own,

00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:33.600
based on your own development.

00:44:34.229 --> 00:44:37.246
When the things are actually

00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:41.969
in the development process,
then you can set either it is tab,

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:47.707
so if you wanted to press the link
or press the Enter or Space,

00:44:47.708 --> 00:44:51.158
then you can choose
your functionality, like that way.

00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:52.629
But before that,

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.789
you need to set
the Playwright environment.

00:44:56.843 --> 00:45:00.492
<v Annabelle> There's quite a few people
actually asking about your tools,

00:45:00.493 --> 00:45:02.193
and they were in the chat as well,

00:45:03.578 --> 00:45:07.149
including the AI
from your Chrome DevTools.

00:45:07.508 --> 00:45:11.079
Have you got any examples of
when you've used that AI?

00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:13.129
Have you found it useful in that way?

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:19.449
<v Anam> Before using AI,
I always suggest you know it,

00:45:19.868 --> 00:45:24.248
because if you are asking AI
regarding some ARIA roles,

00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:32.474
just actually learn about the ARIA roles,
because not every time AI

00:45:32.852 --> 00:45:38.108
gives you the best result for you,
because the purpose you needed,

00:45:38.258 --> 00:45:41.737
but AI sometimes gives
you the different results.

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:46.418
Before you take example
or take answer from AI,

00:45:47.228 --> 00:45:50.678
at first learn it yourself,
because if you are not having

00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:56.588
any experience, then you might not get
the right answer from the AI also.

00:45:58.259 --> 00:46:00.369
If I get confused with AI,

00:46:00.428 --> 00:46:03.449
I also use some of the,

00:46:03.529 --> 00:46:07.118
I can say, the MDN resource,
like Mozilla resource.

00:46:07.949 --> 00:46:10.749
I use those things
as my personal learning,

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:15.607
but when I got some of those things,
I got to know from my experience,

00:46:15.608 --> 00:46:21.603
then I use the ChatGPT or Claude
for the more detailed use case,

00:46:21.893 --> 00:46:26.154
but if I'm on development process,
then Google Chrome DevTools,

00:46:26.205 --> 00:46:30.419
like Google AI comes into play
for most of the cases.

00:46:31.678 --> 00:46:35.367
<v Annabelle> Is it possible for you
to perhaps make a list

00:46:35.368 --> 00:46:36.429
of some of the tools

00:46:36.429 --> 00:46:38.888
that you are using
in your demonstration today,

00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:41.348
and then perhaps
we can have them available

00:46:41.348 --> 00:46:43.929
for people afterwards,
once the video is released?

00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:46.299
<v Anam> Sure, definitely.

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:47.849
<v Annabelle> That'd be great.

00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:49.944
Thank you so much, everyone,

00:46:49.945 --> 00:46:53.215

00:46:53.588 --> 00:46:57.308
You can continue your conversation
in chat for a wee while,

00:46:57.449 --> 00:46:59.138
or on social media,

00:46:59.369 --> 00:47:06.226
using the hashtag #WPA11YDAY.

00:47:06.458 --> 00:47:13.568
Another hashtag
is #WPAD2025, and we'd also appreciate it

00:47:13.598 --> 00:47:23.851
if you could go to the URL
2025.wpaccessibility.day/feedback,

00:47:24.279 --> 00:47:28.059
and then you can provide
anonymous feedback for our speakers

00:47:28.149 --> 00:47:29.438
on their presentation.

00:47:29.918 --> 00:47:33.188
You can enter to win
a T-shirt while you're there.

00:47:34.089 --> 00:47:39.008

which is Real Inclusion: How to Run

00:47:39.009 --> 00:47:43.658
