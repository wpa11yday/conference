Joe Dolson: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.140
I'm Joe Dolson, a lead organizer
of WordPress Accessibility Day

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.168
and a board member

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.939
of the WP Accessibility Day
non-profit organization

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.350
along with Bet Hannon
and Amber Hinds.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.289
I'm also a member
of the WordPress Accessibility Team

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.139
and a core committer
on the WordPress Open Source Project.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.190
This is
our fifth WordPress Accessibility Day

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.990
and we're pretty excited
about what's coming up.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.070
It's truly amazing to see
how much this event has changed

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.884
since the WordPress Accessibility Team
founded it in 2020.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.949
We've got 28 speakers this year
with 28 unique perspectives

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.050
on the user experience for people
with disabilities on the web.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.569
Our speakers represent 11 countries
and 10 time zones making this event

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.570
truly global.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.450
A quarter of our speakers self-identify
as living with a disability.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.408
This year's sessions cover
an enormous range of topics from coping

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.542
with irregular
and unpredictable bandwidth,

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.789
to developing with continuous testing,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.240
to the accessibility of physical events.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.149
There are topics at every level
and we hope you're all able to take

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.406
something with you from this event
that you can apply

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.949
in your everyday work on or off the web.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.050
As of this moment,

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:22.799
we have 2,097 attendees
registered to attend.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.159
That's an incredible response
and we're amazed by your excitement

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859
about WordPress and accessibility.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.459
This event wouldn't be possible
without our amazing team of organizers

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.950
and the generous support of our sponsors.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.910
This year's organizing team
included almost 30 people

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.328
and there are
about an additional 30 volunteers

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.789
helping out today to make
this event run smoothly.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.880
I'd be remiss if I didn't make
a point of thanking our team leads.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.600
Bet Hannon, sponsors and finance,

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.940
Adrian Grace, volunteers team,
Isla Waite, technology and vendors,

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.120
June Liu and Michelle Frechette,
marketing,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.579
Joni Halabi, translations,

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:06.059
Ricky Blacker, post-event issues,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.570
Ricky Onsman,

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.939
Asia Pacific liaison,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.009
and Ryan Bracey, speakers,

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.748
and Amber Hinds,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.598
who isn't leading a specific team
for the first time

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.529
but whose organizational skill is
the key to making this whole thing work.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
We announced our translation project
during last year's event

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.149
and at that time we had
30 translations either completed

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.200
or in progress.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.540
Joni has done a fabulous job
keeping this program rolling

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.229
and as of today we have 77 completed
translations and another 34 in progress.

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.650
If you're interested
in contributing to translations,

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:47.438
sign up
at https://wpaccessibility.day/translate.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.559
Our sponsors make sure that we can afford
to provide quality captioning,

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.250
American Sign Language interpretation,
pay our speakers,

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.979
and cover
the costs of all the technical aspects

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.629
that make this event accessible.

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.280
I'd like to personally thank
our Platinum sponsors,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.940
Gravity Forms, Woo, and WP Engine.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.320
Please check out their sponsor pages
on the WordPress Accessibility Day website

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:21.299
at 2025.wpaccessibility.day/sponsors
to learn more about their offerings

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.609
and see what deals
they're offering attendees.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.981
I'd also like to thank
our Gold sponsors, A11y by Elementor,

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:32.730
Equalize Digital, GoDaddy, GreenGeeks,

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:33.939
and Yoast.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.929
Your efforts to promote
accessibility are critical

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.610
to everything we've accomplished.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.569
We can't forget our Silver
and Bronze sponsors.

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.163
A big thank you
to our Silver sponsors,

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:46.213
AAArdvark,

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:51.240
CodeGeek, Kinetic Iris, Kinsta, Pressable,
and Second Melody,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.430
and our 15 Bronze sponsors.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.860
All of our sponsors
are represented on the website

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:01.310
at 2025.wpaccessibility.day/sponsors.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.819
Please check them out.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.959
I'd also like to throw a shout out
to our growing community of micro-sponsors

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:07.552
and donors.

00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:10.290
You are helping to make
this event sustainable.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.330
Thank you for your generosity.

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.529
Our goal is not only to have
an event about accessibility.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.970
It's to include people with disabilities
everywhere in the process.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.880
A key mantra of the disability
rights movement

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.160
is about decision-making.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.050
Nothing about us without us.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.689
I don't identify as a person
with a disability,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.890
and I may be about as far as you can get
in terms of privilege as a white man

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.290
in my late 40s without a disability.

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:41.139
Including people with disabilities
requires intention.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.479
We're fortunate that many of our speakers
are also people with disabilities,

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.509
but that good fortune is
the result of hard work to make sure

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.109
that we're using inclusive platforms
and communicating effectively

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.819
at every point in the process.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.419
One thing we want
to do is always focus on improving.

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:01.799
Please, don't hesitate to give us feedback
about anything you think

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.100
we could have done better.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.529
We're all here to learn.

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.529
There's a feedback form linked
in the navigation menu on the website,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.430
and it will stay open
for one week following the event.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.348
Let's move forward and get this event
started so we can all take another step

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.849
in our learning process
towards better inclusivity.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.290
In a few minutes,

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:22.709
we'll introduce
our amazing keynote speaker,

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.079
Vitaly Friedman.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.390
In the meantime,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.889
make yourself comfortable and get
ready for 24 hours of learning.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.601
Thank you for attending
WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.
