>> ANNABELLE DRUMM: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.821
My name is Annabelle Drumm.
I'm a knitwear designer

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.833
with DrummRoll Knitwear.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.351
Thank you for joining us
for the presentation,

00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:48.390
Real Inclusion: How to Run Insightful
and Respectful User Testing

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.721
with Disabled People with Lucy Collins.

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:57.301
Lucy is owner of Web Usability,
a specialist user research

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.490
and accessibility consultancy.

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:04.231
She's passionate about giving people
the evidence they need to create

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.201
digital experiences that work for all.

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.264
With a decade of experience
in the UX space,

00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:15.571
her mission is to prioritize
the needs of users to create

00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.231
online experiences
that are accessible, functional,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.540
and enjoyable for users.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.401
She's a vocal advocate for the importance
of digital accessibility

00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.911
and ensuring the online world
works for everyone.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.900
In her time at Web Usability,
she's developed

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:39.331
a robust accessibility service,
harnessing inclusive user research,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.621
and working with many organisations

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.531
to embed accessibility
in their processes and practices.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.531
She shares much of her experience
as host of the Web Usability podcast,

00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.430
where she also has the pleasure
of interviewing and learning

00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.219
from a range of inspiring
guests who generously share

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.010
their lived experiences of disability
and neurodivergence.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.201
Please feel free to add your questions
to the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:13.351
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.701
and use chat to connect
to other attendees.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.231
Welcome, Lucy.

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:23.670
>> LUCY COLLINS: Well, good morning.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.309
Thank you so much
for joining me today for my talk,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.151
Real Inclusion: How to Run Insightful
and Respectful User Testing

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.621
with Disabled People.

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:34.921
It is bright and early here
in the UK, eight o'clock.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.891
I know that we hopefully have some people
joining us from all over the world,

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:38.939
so good morning,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.200
good afternoon, and good evening,
depending on where you are in the world,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.741
and listening into this.

00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.330
Let's just start
with a little introduction,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.221
an introduction of myself to begin with.

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:51.451
My name is Lucy Collins.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.271
I am a white woman
with blonde hair in my mid-30s,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.270
and today I'm wearing
a bright orange jumper,

00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:59.010
because there's nothing
like bright colours,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.660
to get us started in the morning.

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:03.540
I run an organisation called Web Usability.

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:07.290
We are a user research
and accessibility consultancy based

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:08.321
in the UK.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.259
The organisation was founded by my own mum
and dad 23 years ago at a time when UX

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.561
was very much in its infancy,
and I now continue their legacy

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.160
with the vision of creating
an equitable online world that works

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
for everyone.

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:24.061
We are a small
but specialist team of researchers

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.271
who surface what it is that customers
need from an online experience,

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:29.421
and then test to optimize
those experiences.

00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:32.221
We are really passionate
about digital inclusion,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.629
and work with organisations across sectors
to try and remove the barriers that allow

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.581
for full online participation.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.830
This is why I'm here today.

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.021
I'm here today to talk to you

00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:47.370
about running insightful and respectful
user testing sessions

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400
with disabled and neurodivergent people.

00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:52.971
I've been a researcher now
for coming up to about eight years,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.380
and I've run sessions
with many hundreds of users

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:57.960
who have a diverse range of access needs.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.109
I always like to say
at the beginning of things like this that

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:04.170
I myself do not have a disability,
but I'm driven to advocate

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.460
in this space for my mum,

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.609
and the 16 billion people
worldwide like her who have

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.810
a registered disability.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.721
My mum is one of the people
pictured here in this photo.

00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:15.180
This is my team, as you can see,
small but perfectly formed

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.190
with many canine friends.

00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:22.141
My mum and dad who flanked me
on either side of the team here are really

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.640
my inspiration, and certainly,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.820
my mum is the reason
that I feel very passionate to advocate

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.431
for good inclusive online experiences.

00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:33.691
For me, growing up with a disabled parent,
I saw daily the way that society

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.060
was not yet set up to meet their needs.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.890
If I can break down just
some of the barriers

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.101
that she faces to ensure she can live

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.600
a full and independent life,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.331
then I feel I will have done
some good in the world,

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:46.331
so onwards.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.440
For the next half an hour or so,
I'm going to try and distill

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.341
everything that I know
about running inclusive user testing

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.970
so that you too can feel confident to run
inclusive testing sessions with disabled

00:05:56.971 --> 00:05:58.271
and neurodivergent people.

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:01.801
Let's start with a definition.

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:04.860
I flicked onto this slide
briefly as I was trying to get

00:06:04.861 --> 00:06:06.931
my PowerPoint driving skills under control
there,

00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:09.731
so you got a bit of a glimpse
as to what was coming next.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.760
Let's start with a definition.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.139
It might sound obvious,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.540
but I think it's really important for us
to all be on the same page

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.750
by what do we actually mean
by inclusive user testing?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.640
As you can see from
what's just appeared on the screen here,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.490
inclusive user testing is
the process of involving disabled people

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:30.031
with a diverse range of access needs,
including disabled people,

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:33.211
and others often excluded
from mainstream research

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.051
in the evaluation of digital products
or services.

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:40.591
These are effectively what people
might have historically called edge cases,

00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:43.260
but it's not a term that we like to use
because really we're talking

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.181
about a really important sector
of society,

00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:48.601
16 billion people worldwide.

00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:52.290
In the UK alone,
it's 25% of the UK population that have

00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:53.520
a registered disability.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.780
These are not edge cases.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.070
This is a huge portion of the world,
and so what we want to do,

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:02.400
and the goal of inclusive user testing
is to understand how well a product works

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.491
for everyone, and not just
the average user.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.290
When we do inclusive user testing,
we are valuing lived experience

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.393
as essential expertise,
not as a niche perspective.

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:16.233
We're showing that we care
about all of our customers,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.880
and users, and in the end,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.540
build a service
that works better for everyone.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.270
Inclusive user testing can take place

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.801
at any stage
of the digital development process.

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:28.861
The recommendation,
or my recommendation certainly, is always

00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:30.241
that earlier is better.

00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:33.330
We have tested,
and you can test prototypes,

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.910
beta sites, live sites,
marketing campaigns,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.370
really anything that goes online.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.451
Although, you might need
to adapt some different

00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:42.992
or adopt some different approaches,

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:45.151
depending on what it
is that you're testing,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.100
but it is all testable.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.970
Often we hear the excuse
that "we'll get to it later."

00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.741
Well, actually,
I would always challenge you

00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:54.870
to be thinking
in an accessible-first way,

00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:58.921
and thinking about how you can incorporate
inclusive user testing

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.690
into your development cycles

00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:03.361
as early, and as regularly as possible.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.010
On the whole, we prefer
to run moderated user testing

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.521
when working with disabled people.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.091
This is where a researcher will sit in
with the participant while they engage

00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:16.271
with an online journey.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.910
They will observe
what they do, their behaviors,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.291
and sometimes question in real-time
to understand what they're thinking,

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:23.910
and how the participant is feeling.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.310
This is where we're digging
into their attitudes.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.090
The reason we prefer this approach is
because you can respond dynamically

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.761
to the individual needs of a participant.

00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:36.571
You can clarify instructions
if at any point they are unclear.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.529
You can troubleshoot tech issues,
which is especially common

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.170
when you are running
remote testing sessions.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.110
You can adapt your approach
as you're struggling,

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.210
or if the participant is struggling.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.070
You can really lean into the rapport
that you as a researcher will build up

00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:56.311
with your participant to ensure
that they can fully participate

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.641
in the session.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.380
You can, of course, do user testing
in an unmoderated fashion whereby you give

00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.440
people an online journey,
and you give them a scenario,

00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.541
or a task to complete,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.240
and you ask them to self-report
on the experience that they're having.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.715
It might be a better approach
for some neurodivergent

00:09:16.716 --> 00:09:20.516
and disabled people who find certain forms
of social interaction challenging.

00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:24.600
However, if you moderate your sessions
with respect and empathy,

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.421
and we're going to explore
how we do that later in the session,

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.400
then the moderated approach,
in my opinion,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.450
is the best approach.

00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:32.851
It's certainly the approach
that we're going to be focusing

00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:34.080
on mostly today.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.010
Why?

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.450
Why should you do it?

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.130
I'm hoping, given this is
an accessibility conference,

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:45.440
that this isn't a point that I'm going
to have to labour too much,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.230
but I do think it's important for us
to have the language,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.060
to have the justification for doing
inclusive user testing so that when we go

00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:54.380
back to our teams and say,

00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:56.450
"Hey, this is something
that I would like to plan

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.201
into our roadmap,"
we can justify why it's so important.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.469
The first,
and I think most important point

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.890
to hammer home in the session today
is that WCAG compliance

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.401
does not necessarily equal
full accessibility.

00:10:10.634 --> 00:10:14.480
WCAG, which I'm sure almost everybody
on this call will be familiar with,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.121
is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:22.040
They are the benchmark for good,
accessible digital experiences.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.999
But they are the floor and not
the ceiling of what we should be aiming

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.450
to achieve when it comes
to digital accessibility.

00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:31.818
For many, WCAG compliance checks
is a great starting point.

00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:34.568
It really is.
I'm a fan of WCAG.

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:37.098
I think there's a lot of people
in the accessibility space

00:10:37.098 --> 00:10:39.981
that feel that WCAG doesn't
do as much as it should.

00:10:40.495 --> 00:10:44.691
It doesn't, but for anybody trying
to get into digital accessibility,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.400
it is a great place to start.

00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:51.380
I would always recommend getting
to a WCAG compliance as the floor,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.810
but it is that.
It is just the starting point.

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:57.041
It is not where we should be finishing
our accessibility efforts.

00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:01.431
Often, if things
are simply WCAG compliant,

00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:06.141
it might result in a service meeting
an accessibility standard on paper,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.571
yet remain frustratingly unusable

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:11.451
in practice for people
who have disabilities.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.033
Let's take a couple of examples of that.

00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.749
WCAG does very little to address

00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:19.088
the needs of speech
recognition software users.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.282
Dragon Naturally Speaking

00:11:20.282 --> 00:11:22.942
is one of the most common
speech recognition softwares

00:11:22.993 --> 00:11:24.951
available on the market today.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.400
It doesn't work well with drop-downs.

00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:30.200
It's just a limitation of that technology.

00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.151
We've tested this hundreds
and hundreds of times,

00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:35.871
and we've seen repeatedly, that drop-downs and Dragon are not good friends.

00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:39.350
You could have a drop-down
that is perfectly marked up,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.120
that has all the right labels,
that's associated correctly

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
with those labels,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.741
and it will work well
for a screen-reader user,

00:11:45.741 --> 00:11:47.901
it might work well
for a visually impaired user,

00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:50.240
and it might work well
for someone who's neurodivergent,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.120
or has a cognitive impairment,
but it probably won't

00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:55.910
work well for a Dragon user.

00:11:56.541 --> 00:11:57.991
That is a limitation of WCAG.

00:11:59.331 --> 00:12:02.809
If we were to test that experience
with a Dragon user,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.991
you would quite quickly see
that it's not a good accessible solution.

00:12:06.141 --> 00:12:08.959
It might be that actually,
a checkbox component is going

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.310
to be better than a drop-down
in that situation.

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:14.182
It's quite a specific one and quite minor,
but it's the sort of thing

00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:17.241
that if that drop-down is
in a central field in a form,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.610
and somebody with Dragon
can't complete it,

00:12:19.731 --> 00:12:22.931
then you've immediately got
a completely inaccessible experience.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:31.220
By addressing barriers early,
it's also going to save you money,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.320
and it probably might
even make you some money,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.851
so this is the second reason

00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:36.081
why to do it.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.320
This is a really compelling argument
for anybody that's driven

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.231
by the bottom line,
by return on investment.

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.620
If I'm going to do this, what's that going
to look like for my bottom line?

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.610
Well, the great thing is that fixing
accessibility issues in the development

00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:52.850
has been estimated to be
up to 10 times cheaper

00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:54.741
than doing it after launch.

00:12:56.661 --> 00:13:00.949
If we're ironing out as many barriers
as possible during that development phase,

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.560
and as I've already just said,
WCAG compliance does not mean

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.871
we're going to be ironing out
all those barriers.

00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:08.423
By including a round or two
of inclusive user testing

00:13:08.423 --> 00:13:09.823
in that development process,

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.081
you're going to be fixing

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.830
those issues, fixing
those barriers when they're going

00:13:15.831 --> 00:13:17.431
to be quicker and easier to fix.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.061
You're also then not going to accumulate
UX debt or accessibility debt.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.640
This is what happens
when something gets launched

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.520
with a whole bunch of accessibility
or usability issues,

00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:29.961
that debt builds up.

00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.771
Just like any financial debt,
it gets harder to pay off,

00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:35.641
the longer that it sits around for.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.520
It compounds, it accumulates,
and so it's a lot quicker and easier

00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:42.621
if we fix those issues during development.

00:13:43.191 --> 00:13:46.850
We also know that companies that invest
in inclusion can make money.

00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:50.630
A study by Accenture
indicates that companies

00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:52.625
with stronger disability
inclusion practices

00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:55.040
achieve 1.6 times more revenue,

00:13:55.396 --> 00:13:59.451
2.6 times more net income,
and 2 times more economic profit

00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:01.101
compared to less inclusive peers.

00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:04.221
This isn't just limited
to inclusion in the digital space.

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:06.109
This is broader inclusion.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.641
We're looking at recruitment practices.

00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:09.741
We're looking at staff wellness practices.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.090
The point stands that an investment
in inclusion is an investment

00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:16.741
in the long-term success
of any organisation or brand.

00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:19.370
For those that are motivated
by the bottom line,

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.420
this can be a really compelling argument.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.190
You are going to learn so much.

00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:30.381
We always encourage our clients
to observe inclusive user testing live

00:14:30.651 --> 00:14:33.201
where we've got the permission
from the participant.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.070
It is a truly eye-opening,
and enlightening experience.

00:14:37.946 --> 00:14:42.334
Watching any sort of research helps
to challenge the mental model

00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:45.260
that we all have about
how the world works.

00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:46.640
Our experiences,

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.171
our idea of what is normal is going
to be dictated by the life that we've led,

00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.681
the experiences that we've had up
until that date,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.640
but they are unique to us.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.070
Nobody else has had our lived experience.

00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.554
The most amazing thing
about observing lived experience testing,

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:05.510
inclusive user testing,
is that just momentarily,

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.139
you get to walk in that person's shoes,
and you get to experience

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.140
the frustrations, and the barriers
that are put in their way.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.340
This is the biggest motivator for change.

00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:18.830
Let's take a screen reader user,
for example.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.982
If you've never seen a screen reader
in action or someone who's

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:25.040
a power screen reader user
navigating a website,

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:28.174
then the number of times I've come
out of a session and debriefed

00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:30.141
with the client afterward,
and they've just gone,

00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.061
"Wow, that was incredible."

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.400
Because of our ableist attitudes,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.161
we have these biases about what we think
disabled people can achieve online.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.650
They are almost always incorrect.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.850
We work with lots
of really fantastic blind individuals

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.311
who use screen readers
at a phenomenal rate.

00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:54.621
They will be able to navigate a website
quicker than I can as a sighted user

00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:57.649
because they have
their screen reader set to four,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.239
five, six times normal speaking rate,
to the point where I cannot

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.540
understand necessarily always
what it's saying,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.471
but they're so tuned in
to their screen reader,

00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:08.721
they're so at one
with the piece of technology

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:14.661
that they are able to navigate a website
so fast if it's set up correctly for them.

00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:19.520
Also, it falls down so quickly
when a button is missing a label,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.900
or a form field is missing
a proper programmatic markup or there's

00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:26.180
no heading structure
on the page that helps them get

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.380
a sense of how all the content
fits together.

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:31.551
The same is true,
the feeling of pain when you see

00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:32.931
a speech recognition software,

00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:35.239
and this is a scenario
that has happened for us

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.390
when we've been testing

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.450
someone who is a passionate gamer

00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:42.949
who has spinal muscular atrophy,
very limited use of his arms,

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.329
but he loves to game.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.609
It's still a thing that he is able to do.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.811
It brings him such joy.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.460
Being on one of his favorite websites,
and wanting to buy a game that has been

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:57.140
on his bucket list for a while,
he was then unable to buy it

00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:00.860
because the buy button didn't work
with his speech recognition software.

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:04.281
Such a simple issue, but so important.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.929
This is why I say observe these sessions
and do them in the first place

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.760
because you will learn a lot.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.451
The final thing to say is
that you will create

00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.591
a better digital experience for everyone.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.800
It is a well-established fact
that when you build

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.000
accessible experiences,
you build experiences

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.530
that work better for everyone.

00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:25.759
Access is the core of universal design.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.930
It's what everything is built around,
so baking it in from the very start

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:32.931
will ensure that we create experiences
that are better for businesses

00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:33.931
and customers.

00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:35.631
What's not to like about that?

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.941
What am I going to cover off?

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:42.035
Quite a long introduction in the end,
but what am I going to cover off

00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:44.600
for the next half an hour or so?

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:48.380
We're going to start with who to involve,
how to ensure

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.240
that we are being well representative

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:52.761
in the sample that we choose.

00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:56.271
We're going to talk about where to find
people and make sure that we're finding

00:17:56.271 --> 00:17:57.271
the right people

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.181
for the testing sessions.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.463
We're going to talk about how we recruit
those people in a kind, empathetic,

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:05.450
and ethical manner to ensure
that they can fully participate

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.900
in the sessions.

00:18:06.927 --> 00:18:09.827
We're going to make sure
that we're setting up for success.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.500
We're going to look
at our moderation techniques.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.300
As I said, I'm going to be focusing
today on moderated user testing sessions,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.201
and I want to ensure
that I'm equipping you

00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:21.411
with the right skills to be able
to moderate those sessions again,

00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:24.051
so people can fully participate
in the testing.

00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:29.361
We're going to talk about how we follow up
with testers following the testing itself.

00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:32.031
We're just going to touch
on some of the common mistakes

00:18:32.031 --> 00:18:33.081
that I typically see,

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.150
and how, hopefully, we can avoid them.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440
To dive in.

00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:40.161
When we think
about who we want to involve,

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.860
we want to ensure
that we're being fully representative,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.651
and not tokenistic in our representation.

00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:49.280
Often, clients
will approach me and say, "Oh,

00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:52.681
we would like to have one blind person,
one visually impaired person.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.981
We'd like someone
with a physical disability."

00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:56.749
It feels a bit checkbox.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.700
It feels a bit like we're trying
to tick off the conditions,

00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:02.835
and because we are very focused
on looking at the world

00:19:02.836 --> 00:19:04.186
through the social model of disability,

00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:06.877
the idea that people
are disabled by society,

00:19:07.057 --> 00:19:09.200
and not by their medical condition,

00:19:09.531 --> 00:19:14.120
we quite like to move the emphasis away
from the disability that somebody has,

00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:18.291
and focus more on the input,
and output need that they have,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.200
so not just types of users.

00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:22.250
By this, I mean,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.451
input, "what do we do?", and output, "what do we perceive?"

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.610
When we focus on this modality,
we focus on the moment of interaction

00:19:31.641 --> 00:19:34.191
rather than the medical diagnosis
that somebody has.

00:19:34.427 --> 00:19:36.591
Let's take an example
from the Input column.

00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:38.781
What we do--
my mum,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.949
who has a physical disability,
yes, she's got multiple sclerosis,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.849
but actually, that's not the information
that you as a website designer,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.300
developer, content writer,
need to know about her.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.510
What you need to know is
that she has limited mobility

00:19:52.511 --> 00:19:57.039
in her hands, and she relies
on a speech input most of the time

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.940
to control her computer and her phone.

00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:03.671
Her input method is voice or speech.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.098
Her output method, however, is visual.

00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:10.600
Or in fact, it's probably multimodal,
because her eyesight is fine,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600
her hearing is fine.

00:20:12.018 --> 00:20:15.368
She's going to be looking for things
that she can both see and hear.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.851
Let's take one of our blind testers,
for example.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.100
They would be using a screen reader.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.361
Their input is going to be keyboard,
because they're using their keyboard

00:20:25.451 --> 00:20:28.661
to control their screen reader
and navigate around a website.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.940
Their output is going to be audio.

00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:33.940
They need to be able to hear
everything about a website,

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.380
the structure, the content,

00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:37.960
the images, the videos,
whatever else it might be,

00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:40.390
it all needs to be done in audio content.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.850
This approach of thinking about input
and output helps us identify where designs

00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:48.041
fail real people in real situations.

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.929
We can ensure inclusivity for all users,
regardless of what condition

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.580
or identity they might have.

00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:01.630
The nice thing about thinking about it
in this approach is that it allows us

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:08.289
to test for all of the various different
intersectional combinations of disability,

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.590
and access needs
that might exist in the world.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.381
Instead of saying someone
with a disability needs this,

00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.650
we can ask, what if someone doesn't have
use of both hands right now,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.650
what do they do?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.500
As I say, this
could be someone like my mum,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.621
it could be someone who's had a stroke,
it could be someone who's tetraplegic,

00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:25.361
it could be someone
with a limb difference.

00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:27.699
It could also be me
when I'm holding my baby,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.000
I'm a mum of two,
and I'm quite often doing things

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
one-handed.

00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:35.680
It could be someone standing on a metro,
on underground and holding on

00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.181
for dear life with one hand.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.690
The great thing
about this approach is that,

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.610
actually, what we're going
to be doing is designing better

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.561
for everybody rather than focusing

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.481
on certain disabilities.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.940
Typically, when we think
about the sample size

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.711
of who we are testing with,

00:21:51.164 --> 00:21:53.230
the wonderful thing
about qualitative research,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.120
which is what this is,
is that you don't need

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.960
big sample sizes to get
some really valuable robust insight.

00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:04.781
We might be looking to test
with somewhere between 5 and 12 users

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.090
on an average session.

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:11.319
Within that, you can normally get
a good variety across this input

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.470
and output diversity
that we're looking for.

00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:17.031
You might end up with someone
who relies on keyboard navigation

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.411
as an input, and has an audio output.

00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:22.781
In this case, it could be
a screen reader user.

00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:25.841
You might have somebody
who relies on a voice input,

00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:28.031
but can have a multimodal output.

00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:30.550
Like my mum,
speech recognition software user,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.341
but with sight and hearing.

00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:38.801
It might be somebody who relies on touch,
a braille user for both input

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.940
and output, perhaps.

00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:44.201
You're having that tactile app output
as well as a touch input.

00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.411
Could be someone who uses
an eye tracking or gaze technology,

00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:52.781
again, because of a physical disability
that limits their use of their limbs.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.171
Again, they might then be requiring
an auditory output,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.841
or a visual-only one.

00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:01.301
We really like this model.

00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:04.060
We really like this approach of thinking
about who we're going to involve.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.760
We think that this moves people away
from fairly tokenistic representation,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.590
which is one of the biggest pitfalls
that we see in this world.

00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:15.191
Let's talk about where to find
people, because this is

00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:18.620
one of the common barriers to not doing
inclusive user testing that we hear

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.170
all the time.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.415
"Oh, we don't know
how to reach people with disabilities."

00:23:22.802 --> 00:23:25.780
I always think that this is a really,
really bad excuse,

00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:31.990
because 16% of the global population
have a registered disability.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.559
An awful lot of people
in the UK alone, as I said,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.191
I think it's 24%,
which is about 16 million people

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.471
who have a disability

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.810
in the UK alone.

00:23:45.041 --> 00:23:47.720
All I say to people in this situation
is that we might just need to work

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720
a little bit harder,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.330
or alter our approaches to meet
those people where they are,

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:54.850
rather than expecting them to come to us.

00:23:56.281 --> 00:23:57.251
Where can we find them?

00:23:57.251 --> 00:23:58.651
Firstly, your customer base.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.699
I don't know what sorts of organisations we've got sitting in

00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:02.699
and listening today,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.370
but I bet a lot of you've got customers,
and I bet a lot of your customers

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:07.570
might have disabilities.

00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:12.700
Bear in mind that 80% of dissabilities
are not visible.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.211
Not everybody's going to feel comfortable
to disclose the fact that they have

00:24:16.211 --> 00:24:17.211
a disability to you.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.701
That's absolutely fine,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.971
but it is a great place
to start is reaching out

00:24:22.001 --> 00:24:23.200
to your customer base,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.830
inquiring in an empathetic
and ethical manner,

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:30.031
which we will come on to, whether or not anybody would be willing

00:24:30.281 --> 00:24:32.381
to support you
in your website development.

00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:36.152
Then building up a bit of a pool of people
that you can go back to regularly,

00:24:36.152 --> 00:24:40.030
a community of people
who you can work with,

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.761
and co-create inclusive outcomes.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.799
Charities and advocacy groups, there's
all sorts of fantastic organisations

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.333
all around the world doing
amazing things with people

00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:52.283
who have a whole range of access needs.

00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:55.870
They are often a fantastic conduit,
and a fantastic facilitator

00:24:56.201 --> 00:24:58.450
at giving you introductions to people.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.630
Again,

00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:02.710
when we get on to how to recruit well,
we'll talk about the details

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.390
that should be shared
with these organisations,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.670
ensuring that it's upfront, it's explicit,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.860
and clear as possible.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.309
These, again, are often
a fantastic group of people

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.800
to reach out to if you've got
any concerns,

00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:18.041
or if you're looking to speak
to a particular audience group.

00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:20.861
Let's say you want to speak
to stroke survivors.

00:25:20.861 --> 00:25:22.271
There are stroke organisations.

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:25.361
In the UK alone, we've got a couple,
and no doubt that there's many

00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:26.411
all around the world.

00:25:26.831 --> 00:25:29.471
There will be all sorts of people
that they can facilitate introductions

00:25:29.471 --> 00:25:31.721
to community groups
that they're working with.

00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:33.111
It provides

00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:34.479
a safe introduction,

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.421
a warm introduction if you want to say,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.021
that will ensure, hopefully,
that you get a better response rate

00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:42.421
to your recruitment efforts.

00:25:43.571 --> 00:25:46.450
Social media can be
a fantastic place to find people.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.620
We will quite often run social media ads
to try and build up our pool of people

00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:51.760
that we're testing with.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.305
We'll often be looking for people
from specific communities,

00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:55.510
specific backgrounds.

00:25:55.841 --> 00:25:59.410
This allows us to reach them
where they are rather than expecting them

00:25:59.411 --> 00:26:01.450
to come to us and find our information.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.360
Social media, and you might just want
to think about the channel

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.331
that you're using, which will depend
on the demographic of people

00:26:07.331 --> 00:26:08.381
that you're reaching.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.930
You might want to think
about the method of reaching those people.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.956
Running ads can be effective,
but there is a sense of distrust

00:26:14.956 --> 00:26:16.306
sometimes around those ads.

00:26:16.562 --> 00:26:19.449
We just want to make sure
that with the content

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.541
that we're putting out in those ads,
we are building up as much confidence

00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:25.840
and trust as possible, linking
back to you and the credibility

00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:28.761
that you have as an organisation to ensure that people realize

00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:32.343
that this is a legitimate offer
and something that they can trust.

00:26:33.401 --> 00:26:36.341
Specialist recruitment agencies,
there are obviously a lot of people

00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:38.081
working in this space already.

00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:42.850
We have an in-house recruitment team
that I rely on very heavily

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.414
where we do
all of our recruitment through,

00:26:44.414 --> 00:26:45.910
but there are agencies out there

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.729
that just specialize
in participant recruitment

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.870
for user research,

00:26:49.871 --> 00:26:50.871
market research,

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.390
and a lot of them,
if not all of them hopefully,

00:26:53.531 --> 00:26:59.139
should have specialities about approaching
and managing people who have disabilities

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.221
and neurodivergence.

00:27:01.931 --> 00:27:04.151
Finally, I've got
the option of your staff.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.750
I've quite deliberately put this
at the end of this slide

00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:11.979
because this is not a group
that I would suggest

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.780
that you are necessarily relying on.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.142
The reason I say that is that firstly,

00:27:17.173 --> 00:27:19.002
these people are already
doing a job for you,

00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:21.346
and given the way that
the world is these days,

00:27:21.347 --> 00:27:23.149
no doubt they're already at capacity.

00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:28.210
Our expected outputs in this day
and age are enormous.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.076
If you're then adding an additional load
on top of these people

00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:36.640
to not only do their job,
but also help you test some products,

00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:39.641
then that might be a step too far.

00:27:40.541 --> 00:27:42.851
The last thing that we want
to do is put unnecessary pressure,

00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:45.671
unnecessary stress that could lead
to burnout or fatigue

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.290
that impacts them long-term.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.470
However, having said that,
a lot of organisations have

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.491
community networks,

00:27:52.491 --> 00:27:55.601
have a disabled champions
network internally.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.810
They might be a great place to start.

00:27:58.121 --> 00:28:00.070
Reach out
to your disabled champions network

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.279
if it exists, or to key individuals
who have disclosed,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.441
and are comfortable talking
about their disability,

00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:07.631
and ask them how they feel.

00:28:08.081 --> 00:28:14.349
You could get insight and involvement
from the disabled community that exists

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.650
within your staff network.

00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:18.611
If you are going to engage them
in any sort of testing,

00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:21.100
ensure this isn't factored
into their existing workload.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.800
Don't give this to them as a job
in addition to what they're already doing,

00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:27.141
and make sure they're paid appropriately.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.400
We're going to come on
to what that looks like in just a moment.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.290
How do we recruit well?

00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:36.760
Firstly, and most importantly,
it's about clarity.

00:28:36.971 --> 00:28:39.911
Setting out the process in full.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.719
What this looks like for us
is a summary of the website

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.011
that we might be testing.

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:48.251
We don't necessarily give away
the client or who we're working for,

00:28:48.251 --> 00:28:51.309
but we'll reference
the sector they might be operating in,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.380
or the type of business that they are.

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:56.181
For example, we're currently doing
a project for Disney.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.810
We're not telling people
that we're testing for Disney,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.176
but we're telling people that we're
testing a family holiday website,

00:29:03.226 --> 00:29:05.411
so they have a sense of what's to come.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.001
We then include the exact dates
and time slots so people can be very clear

00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:12.201
on the commitment
that is required from them.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.021
We'll tell them about the logistics.

00:29:14.021 --> 00:29:14.882
Is it in-person?

00:29:14.882 --> 00:29:16.841
Is it remote?

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.950
For in-person testing, we'll always try
to have a venue secured before recruitment

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:25.119
begins so we can give people that address,
and they can understand the burden,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.371
the time commitment
that's required of them to reach

00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:28.371
that venue.

00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:30.880
We'll include
relevant accessibility details,

00:29:30.881 --> 00:29:34.719
including obviously wheelchair access,
but also if there's

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.439
any other additional things
that might help them ensure that the venue

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.721
feels comfortable
and appropriate for them.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:46.241
For remote testing, we will cover off
the technology requirements and,

00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:49.051
as always, try to keep
this as simple as possible.

00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:53.860
Typically, our remote testing setup
requires just a computer with access

00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:54.861
to the internet.

00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:57.130
If we're doing mobile testing,
we might ask people to have

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.180
a smartphone to hand,

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.821
but we try and keep
that as simple as possible.

00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:04.070
We'll include
details of how the session will run,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.729
so the fact that they will be joined
by a researcher who will be there

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.530
to support them through the session.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.721
We'll tell them that there's going
to be an introductory period,

00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:15.801
and then there's going to be some time
where they are asked to use a website

00:30:16.071 --> 00:30:18.121
as if they're in their own home doing it.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.751
We'll tell them that the session
is going to be recorded,

00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:22.581
and what's going
to be done with their data,

00:30:22.581 --> 00:30:25.480
and we'll also tell them whether or not
the session is going to be observed.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.791
As I said before, we really encourage
our clients to observe these sessions

00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:32.001
in real-time to sort
of feel the pain of testers,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:37.250
and really experience the barriers
that they might be facing online.

00:30:38.301 --> 00:30:41.421
We always give our participants the option

00:30:41.933 --> 00:30:42.981
to be observed or not.

00:30:42.981 --> 00:30:45.021
Some people don't always feel
comfortable doing it,

00:30:45.021 --> 00:30:46.040
but where possible,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.382
we will encourage it,
and we'll always make sure

00:30:48.382 --> 00:30:54.200
that they are alerted to the fact
that observers might be present

00:30:54.201 --> 00:30:55.201
ahead of time.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.950
We'll also just cover off payment.

00:30:58.191 --> 00:30:59.811
We'll tell them how much
they're going to get paid,

00:30:59.811 --> 00:31:02.181
and we'll tell them when they can expect
to receive that payment,

00:31:02.181 --> 00:31:03.590
and the method
through which they are going

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.590
to receive it.

00:31:04.761 --> 00:31:06.681
Again, we're really upfront
and transparent

00:31:06.681 --> 00:31:07.781
about all the details.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.021
Hopefully, a fairly obvious one,
but we want to ensure

00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:15.801
that all communications that we send out
are clear and accessible.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.250
We do a lot of our outreach via email,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.373
although we also follow
that up with phone,

00:31:20.374 --> 00:31:22.701
and some face-to-face stuff
as required,

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.830
depending on the group of people
that we are trying to recruit.

00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:29.071
When it comes to email campaigns,
make sure they're accessible.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.571
If you're including links
in your email campaigns,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.361
we don't want to see,
"Just click here," or "Read more."

00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:39.770
We want a nice descriptive text link
that's going to tell them where to go.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.700
You might need to include a screener,

00:31:42.995 --> 00:31:45.980
a form, effectively,
that allows you to see

00:31:45.981 --> 00:31:53.180
whether or not these are going
to be the right people for you.

00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:58.131
If that is the case, make sure
that form itself is accessible.

00:31:59.261 --> 00:32:03.657
We are going to be allowing
people to self-describe.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.380
Allow them to tell you how they talk
about their own disability.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.180
Some of our testers, for example,

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.525
who have sight loss
will call themselves blind.

00:32:13.526 --> 00:32:14.996
Others will say they're visually impaired.

00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:16.976
Others might say that they're non-sighted.

00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:18.778
It's up to them to self-describe.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.640
Finally, we want to make sure
that we are asking people and not assuming

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.610
anything about their condition
or adjustments that they need.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.610
When in doubt,

00:32:26.751 --> 00:32:29.811
ask rather than assume
because the assumption

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.130
is where you're likely to go wrong.

00:32:33.381 --> 00:32:38.211
I have got a slide dedicated to this,
because it is so important that we pay

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.441
our participants.

00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:42.650
People should not be asked
to do testing for free.

00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:46.401
You are gaining invaluable knowledge
regarding their lived experience,

00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:48.801
and they deserve
to be remunerated appropriately.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.041
What this will be will vary a bit depending
on the length of the session,

00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:55.091
where you are in the world,
and the complexity of the testing.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.239
As an example, we typically pay
our testers anywhere between £70

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.751
and £150 depending, again,
on the length of the session,

00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:05.041
and what it is that we're asking of them.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.080
Make sure that the payment
happens promptly,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.411
and make sure it's through a method
that works for testers.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.110
That might be a BACS transfer,
a bank transfer.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.290
It might be PayPal.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.660
It might be another option,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.940
but make sure
that that is clear and transparent right

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.740
from the beginning,
and that payment is a non-negotiable.

00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:26.227
All right, let's talk about
how we're going to set up for success.

00:33:26.227 --> 00:33:28.790
Planning is absolutely critical

00:33:28.911 --> 00:33:31.369
to the success of user testing
in any situation,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.760
but even more so when working
with disabled and neurodivergent people.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.951
Some tasks might take you longer
to complete,

00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:38.151
others might be quicker.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.110
You might need to factor
in breaks or unexpected pauses.

00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:44.001
Be realistic about what you can cover
off in a session.

00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:45.981
This comes a little bit
with trial and error,

00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:48.770
over time it depends a lot
on the user journey that you're testing,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.380
so if in doubt, run
a couple of test sessions before you get

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.631
into the meat of your testing

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.940
so that you can be sure you're using
your time wisely.

00:33:58.252 --> 00:34:02.299
Ahead of your sessions,
we want to understand

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.963
the adjustments
that our participants might need.

00:34:03.963 --> 00:34:06.167
If in person, how will they get to you?

00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:09.590
What information do they need in advance
to feel confident that they can attend

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.290
the space in a good frame of mind?

00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:15.281
If remote, what tech setup will they need,
and have you communicated this?

00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:16.593
Are captions enabled?

00:34:16.774 --> 00:34:19.101
Do you need to bring in a BSL interpreter?

00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:21.501
Are there any disclosed triggers
that could be avoided,

00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:23.900
such as moving content
or maximal contrast?

00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:27.201
If you're unsure about any
of this, as said previously,

00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:28.700
ask, don't assume.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.899
Finally, it might be useful
to set up a test session,

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.800
particularly, when you're doing
remote testing with people.

00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:39.006
It might not be necessary for everybody,
but if anybody is showing

00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:40.461
any kind of concern,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.131
or hesitation
about what's required of them,

00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:46.729
just spend 5, 10 minutes
joining a Zoom call

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.840
or a Teams call,

00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:50.961
whatever system that you're using,
talk them through the process,

00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:52.778
make sure they feel comfortable
about the technology

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:54.925
that they're going to need at their end
to ensure

00:34:54.925 --> 00:34:57.349
that they can get comfortably settled

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.130
into the session,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.131
and you are going to be getting
the most out of the research.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.060
Okay, I want to talk a little bit
about our moderation techniques,

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.060
because really,

00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:10.849
the reason I recommend moderated testing
is because this is where you're going

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.051
to get the most deep,

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.751
rich insight out of your testing sessions.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.670
Building trust as quickly as possible
is the thing that will make or break

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.591
a research session.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.600
Rapport, rapport, rapport.

00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:26.870
This will depend a little bit.

00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:29.361
You might have to adapt your approach
depending on who you've got.

00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:31.670
For example, if I'm doing
a remote testing session

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.920
with someone who's blind,

00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:35.451
I'm going to be using
a lot more vocal cues to let them know

00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:36.451
that I'm listening,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.300
and that I understand what they're saying,
and to keep them going.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.361
If it's a deaf person, I might be using
a bit more body language.

00:35:44.361 --> 00:35:49.160
I might be articulating things
in a slightly different way.

00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:53.407
For certain neurodivergents,
I might take time to repeat key details,

00:35:53.457 --> 00:35:55.882
or slow down what I'm saying
to ensure that it's really,

00:35:55.882 --> 00:35:59.901
really registering with them
as we're going through the session.

00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:03.471
Reiterate those session details,
so they will have been told

00:36:03.471 --> 00:36:05.971
everything upfront
during that recruitment process,

00:36:06.051 --> 00:36:08.251
but take time
at the beginning of the session

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.071
to reiterate those detail,

00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:14.271
and make sure that everybody is clear,
and happy with what the session is going

00:36:14.271 --> 00:36:16.071
to look like before you get started.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.561
I had one experience,
and as you probably have gathered

00:36:18.561 --> 00:36:20.451
from the way I'm delivering
this presentation,

00:36:20.451 --> 00:36:22.551
I do sometimes speak a little bit quickly,

00:36:23.121 --> 00:36:25.850
especially if I'm a bit excited
or a little bit nervous,

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.050
as I definitely was
at the beginning of this.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.071
What I always try
and do as well is slow things down,

00:36:31.071 --> 00:36:34.130
because I have had feedback,
particularly from neurodivergent testers,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.870
that sometimes they find the speed
at which I speak to them overwhelming.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.750
Take time to slow it down
and give people these details

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.240
slowly and clearly.

00:36:44.811 --> 00:36:45.860
Create space.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.600
Be comfortable to sit in silence,
and quietly observe.

00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:53.630
Some disabled users might need longer
to process information,

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.061
and comprehend it, so give them this time.

00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:59.751
Don't jump in with a follow-up question
or interrupt their thinking process.

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:03.251
Allow them to work through the journey,
but where it feels appropriate,

00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:05.330
if you haven't heard from them
in a little while,

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.330
gently prompt.

00:37:06.411 --> 00:37:07.640
How does this make you feel?

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.931
What's your reaction to this?

00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:11.245
How clear or otherwise do you find
this content?

00:37:11.245 --> 00:37:13.155
There's lots of ways
that we can ensure, sorry,

00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:17.629
not everybody's going to be able
to express themselves in a flowing,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.580
articulate, quotable way.

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:23.480
For some users, we're going
to be relying heavily on the behaviors

00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.531
that they exhibit,

00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:28.311
and they might need a little bit
more coaxing to get their thoughts across.

00:37:28.311 --> 00:37:30.620
Take the time, create
the space to allow people

00:37:30.621 --> 00:37:35.181
to comfortably and confidently communicate
how they're thinking,

00:37:35.451 --> 00:37:37.801
and feeling as you're going
through the session.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.651
Offer response options.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.401
Mostly, we encourage people
to talk their responses.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.050
That might not be
the best method for everybody.

00:37:46.061 --> 00:37:47.090
If that is the case,

00:37:47.492 --> 00:37:51.830
consider allowing people
to type their responses,

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:54.011
or give them to you in a different way.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.650
This is all about adapting your approach,
and offering options to ensure

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.368
that people can participate fully.

00:38:00.261 --> 00:38:01.521
Notice cues of fatigue.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.150
Some disabled people
will experience fatigue quickly.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.100
We work with a visually impaired tester

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.830
regularly who finds white
glaring screens, not dissimilar

00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:12.051
to what I've got here today,
to be totally honest with you,

00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:14.251
really fatigue her eyes
after a little while.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.833
Notice for those cues of fatigue,
and offer breaks,

00:38:18.043 --> 00:38:20.553
if you feel they're needed.

00:38:20.993 --> 00:38:22.669
This is where regular check-ins come in.

00:38:22.669 --> 00:38:24.769
Through your session,
check-in with people,

00:38:24.831 --> 00:38:27.620
make sure that they are okay,

00:38:27.713 --> 00:38:30.380
and feeling comfortable,
and confident to continue.

00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:34.400
The end of the session
should not necessarily be

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.800
the end of the relationship.

00:38:35.961 --> 00:38:38.011
Take time to follow up and say thank you.

00:38:38.031 --> 00:38:41.030
You have just experienced
something truly amazing.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.221
Somebody has shared
their lived experience.

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:45.110
That is invaluable, so say thank you.

00:38:45.793 --> 00:38:51.141
Pay promptly, and pay
within the set-out timeframes

00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:53.821
that you gave them right
at the very beginning.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.611
Register repeat interest.

00:38:55.611 --> 00:38:58.131
This is a fantastic way
to build up a community of people

00:38:58.131 --> 00:39:01.531
that you can continue to work with,
that you can co-create with even.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.764
Make sure that
you register peoples' repeat interest.

00:39:05.974 --> 00:39:08.329
On the whole, almost everybody
that we work with will want

00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:09.270
to work with us again,

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.921
which is a fantastic testament to the way
that we run research, I believe.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.640
The common mistakes, which we've covered
off a little bit already,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.321
but tokenistic representation.

00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:20.831
Make sure that you are including
a really diverse,

00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:22.041
broad range of people,

00:39:22.341 --> 00:39:24.157
and not just one
or two testers to say,

00:39:24.157 --> 00:39:27.380
"Oh, well, we've done it,
because we've included one blind person."

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.870
That's not fully inclusive testing.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.460
Don't slack on the prep.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460
Prepare to fail.

00:39:32.571 --> 00:39:34.730
No, fail to prepare, but prepare to fail.

00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:36.171
That's the way around, isn't it?

00:39:36.171 --> 00:39:37.421
Don't slack on that prep.

00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:41.060
Try not to bias the testing sessions
by creating the space and sitting

00:39:41.061 --> 00:39:42.061
in the silence.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.319
You will allow people
to fully express themselves.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.720
Don't ask leading questions.

00:39:46.791 --> 00:39:47.810
Ask broad,

00:39:47.841 --> 00:39:51.170
open questions that allow people
to give you their full thoughts

00:39:51.171 --> 00:39:52.171
and feelings.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.210
Don't sit on the outcomes.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.352
Once you've got this, use it.

00:39:58.402 --> 00:40:04.130
It's a fantastic load of resources,
and insight that you can use to improve

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.330
your digital experience.

00:40:05.631 --> 00:40:08.060
Even worse, don't dismiss the findings.

00:40:08.391 --> 00:40:10.611
What you have got, again,
is something so valuable.

00:40:10.611 --> 00:40:12.321
Even if it doesn't match
your interpretation,

00:40:12.321 --> 00:40:15.280
and mental model of the world,
that's actually a really important thing

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.330
to challenge yourself

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:20.199
to ensure that you are implementing
the things that make you feel

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.499
a bit uncomfortable,
because where we find that discomfort,

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.411
we are finding
the edges of our developmental space,

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.373
and we're finding growth opportunities.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.450
Don't dismiss outcomes
that you don't agree with.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.781
In summary, test early and often.

00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:37.511
Include a broad range of lived experience.

00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:40.061
Adapt your approach
to your participants' needs

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.731
and pay participants promptly and fairly.

00:40:43.801 --> 00:40:46.061
A few extra resources,
and I know we'll be sharing

00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:48.451
these slides with you afterwards,
so please do head over to our blog,

00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:51.549
our podcast,
and also to the fantastic organisation,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.431
AbilityNet, who offer
user research accreditation training

00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:57.101
for anyone looking to gain
a bit more confidence in running

00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:58.301
these sorts of sessions.

00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:59.829
Thank you.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.540
It's been a real pleasure
to be with you today.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.821
I hope that you've enjoyed listening,
and I look forward to answering

00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.821
your questions.

00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:08.981
Annabelle Drumm: Thank you so much, Lucy.

00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.481
That's really, really helpful.

00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:14.221
We're just going to go to the questions
that we've already got here.

00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:18.399
Before we do that, I'm just wondering
if you could just go

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.179
over the detail of those numbers
that you put at the very beginning,

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.221
that you might want to correct yourself.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.291
Lucy: Yes, I do apologize.

00:41:26.854 --> 00:41:28.151
Numbers are not my strong point.

00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.820
I am a qualitative researcher
for a reason,

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.041
and I think
that that came across there, yes.

00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:35.980
I misquoted some stats right
at the very beginning there

00:41:35.981 --> 00:41:39.071
when we were talking
about the size of the market

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.750
in which we are talking here.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.011
I said 16 billion,

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.560
which, considering that's more
than double the number of people that are

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.310
on the planet, it's probably not quite
the right number.

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:49.871
What I should have said
when we were talking about

00:41:49.871 --> 00:41:51.130
why it's so important

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.550
to do inclusive user testing
is because the stats

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.581
are about 1.3 billion people worldwide.

00:41:57.902 --> 00:42:01.753
That's 16% of the global population.

00:42:01.813 --> 00:42:03.514
That's where I got
my numbers slightly mixed up.

00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:05.934
Thank you for the opportunity
to correct that,

00:42:05.963 --> 00:42:06.853
Annabelle.

00:42:06.854 --> 00:42:08.024
Annabelle: Lovely, thank you.

00:42:08.024 --> 00:42:09.674
First question that we have here.

00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:14.141
How do we ensure that we recruit
in a representative manner,

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:19.180
considering the range
of assistive technologies available

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.887
and various experience levels,
and using them too?

00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:25.990
Lucy: I think this goes back
to what I talked

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.840
about fairly early on in the presentation,
which is around input

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.341
and output diversity.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.001
As much as possible,
what I guess we want to do

00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:37.689
within our sample is have
a variety of those different input

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.920
and output types.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.221
Because we're doing qualitative testing,
it's small sample sizes.

00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:46.371
Typically,

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.050
you are going to have to be taking

00:42:50.261 --> 00:42:52.210
the insight to a certain extent,
I was going to say

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.410
with a pinch of salt,
but that's not right.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.510
You're still getting lots of robust stuff,

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.750
but what I would be suggesting
to people is that you're looking to make

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.390
sure you're ticking off
each of those different input

00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:05.141
and output variety types
in some form or some combination.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.301
When it does come
to the different levels of competence,

00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:13.660
when we're using
digital assistive technology,

00:43:14.201 --> 00:43:17.171
again, it depends
on what the objectives of your research

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.360
are. If you are really just trying
to iron out

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.891
as many technical accessibility barriers
and challenges as possible,

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.620
then ideally, you probably want
to be working with people

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.321
who are fairly proficient at using
their assistive technology,

00:43:29.321 --> 00:43:31.781
because what we want to make
sure we're doing is testing

00:43:31.781 --> 00:43:35.530
where the website is falling down
and creating barriers

00:43:35.531 --> 00:43:41.521
rather than where it's an
assistive technology user challenge

00:43:41.731 --> 00:43:43.121
in that respect.

00:43:43.571 --> 00:43:46.361
Because the more we can do
to iron out those flaws in the website,

00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:49.661
the easier we're then going to make it
for people who are slightly less competent

00:43:49.661 --> 00:43:51.610
at using their assistive technologies.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.400
We are typically testing
with sample sizes,

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400
as I said,

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.690
of anywhere between only
about five people,

00:43:58.751 --> 00:44:01.179
gives you enough to have
one person who goes

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.880
across that input-output diversity

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.200
through to much bigger sample sizes,

00:44:05.591 --> 00:44:06.881
if the budget is available.

00:44:06.881 --> 00:44:09.430
That is often the limiting factor,
unfortunately,

00:44:09.431 --> 00:44:10.871
in most situations.

00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:14.051
Annabelle: One I noticed

00:44:14.711 --> 00:44:16.301
during your talk as well,

00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:19.840
you included some figures

00:44:20.441 --> 00:44:23.140
at the beginning of your talk
about the increase in sales

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.721
when accessibility is addressed
within the website.

00:44:26.051 --> 00:44:31.302
If you have any links to studies
that the participants here could use

00:44:31.303 --> 00:44:33.820
to promote it to their clients,
would you be able to include

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.890
that in your follow-up notes?

00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:37.194
Lucy: Absolutely.
Yes.

00:44:37.195 --> 00:44:40.858
There's some really lovely research papers
that support that.

00:44:40.908 --> 00:44:42.282
I'd be very happy to share those-
Annabelle: Wonderful.

00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:43.661
Lucy: -links, and people can use them.

00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:44.811
Annabelle: Great. Okay.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.830
Now, next question,

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.140
when we allow people to self-describe,
should we at least start

00:44:50.141 --> 00:44:55.029
with a people-first language approach
to come across as respectful?

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.671
What's your feedback on this?

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:00.490
Lucy: It's interesting, because I think
that there's some global differences

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.290
about people first language.

00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:04.150
In the UK here, actually,

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.730
it changes all the time.

00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.510
The current slight preference
is for the word in this case,

00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:16.630
disabled people, because it links more
to the social model of disability.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.240
Whereas I know, I believe in the US,
it's more common to say people

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240
with disabilities.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920
I would, again,

00:45:21.941 --> 00:45:25.791
just take this back to the participant,
to the person that you're speaking to,

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.180
ask them
how they'd like to be referred to.

00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:31.450
You can begin with one way or the other.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.971
If in your society,

00:45:33.972 --> 00:45:37.187
in your culture, people first language
is currently the norm,

00:45:37.377 --> 00:45:40.390
or if it's a bit more
like it is here in the UK,

00:45:40.811 --> 00:45:44.081
then what I would suggest perhaps doing
some research to understand

00:45:44.081 --> 00:45:45.521
how wherever you are,

00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:48.100
localize your language,
so it's appropriate

00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:51.070
for the market that you're speaking to,
but then always give people

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.581
the opportunity to self describe as early
as possible in that conversation to ensure

00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:58.121
that you're not making any assumptions
about how they want to be referred to

00:45:58.121 --> 00:46:01.360
in the same ways that we approach
pronouns and asking people

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.431
how they'd like to be referred to
in that respect.

00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:06.550
It's exactly the same approach
when we're thinking about disability

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:07.570
and neurodivergence.

00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:09.351
Annabelle: Okay, great.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.750
Based on your experience with testings,
do you recommend limiting

00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:17.740
to a device type like mobile or desktop,
or simply leaving it open

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:20.711
to the participants to decide
on their preferred device?

00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:24.790
Lucy: I think there's
a few things to consider here.

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.890
Firstly, what are your testing objectives?

00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:31.100
We'll often be working
with people who are--

00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:33.011
Perhaps they've only
built mobile prototypes

00:46:33.011 --> 00:46:34.930
of what it is that we want to be testing.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.050
In that situation, we are only going
to be testing mobile.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.779
Where we are looking
for a split of devices,

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.980
typically, again,
we'll allow the participant

00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:45.785
to put forward a preference
as to which device

00:46:45.786 --> 00:46:48.280
they would typically be
most comfortable using.

00:46:48.716 --> 00:46:54.724
Then, if they say they have no preference,
then we will ask them to use

00:46:54.731 --> 00:46:57.220
a particular device to ensure
that we're getting the right split

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.421
across our cohort.

00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:02.831
I think it's think about what it is
that you're testing first,

00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:06.491
and then giving people the option
is a really nice way to do it.

00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:09.761
It also might then influence
your recruitment strategy,

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.021
who you're reaching out to,

00:47:11.021 --> 00:47:14.081
if, for example, you are only able
to test on mobile,

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:16.291
because that's the prototypes
that you've got.

00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:16.751
Annabelle: Right,

00:47:17.221 --> 00:47:18.221
okay.

00:47:18.221 --> 00:47:19.064
There are two questions,

00:47:19.115 --> 00:47:20.265
but I think we've only got time for one.

00:47:20.265 --> 00:47:21.675
I'm sorry, Kwaku.

00:47:21.915 --> 00:47:25.384
We will put your question to Lucy,

00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:27.716
and she can answer that after the session.

00:47:27.717 --> 00:47:29.110
This final one,

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.560
it's actually a follow
on about testing sessions.

00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:34.961
How do you recommend setting up
the session

00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:36.436
based on the device?

00:47:36.437 --> 00:47:38.981
Do you use, for example, cameras, mics,

00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:43.600
possibly an ongoing online meeting session
to allow more observers to join?

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:44.794
How would you do that?

00:47:45.481 --> 00:47:49.242
Lucy: As I said, we try and keep
the setup as simple as possible.

00:47:49.322 --> 00:47:53.080
We do most of our remote testing via Zoom.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.050
We will basically send
someone a Zoom link,

00:47:58.219 --> 00:48:00.311
and we'll ask them to join it.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.011
What we'll then ask them
to do is share their screen.

00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:05.141
If they're a screen reader user,
we'll also ask them to share

00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:07.721
their computer audio
so that we at our end can hear

00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:10.451
what the screen reader is saying.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.840
That then allows us
to capture obviously their screen,

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.840
their webcam.

00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:19.540
If we're doing the testing on mobile,
we sometimes ask them to join both

00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.671
on a computer and a phone.

00:48:22.123 --> 00:48:23.920
Then we'll do the screen sharing
via the phone.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.740
That allows us to keep the head
and shoulders camera shot,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.630
which can be a really helpful insight.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.527
Then our observers will simply
just join that Zoom call.

00:48:31.527 --> 00:48:33.827
What we ask them
to do is anonymize themselves.

00:48:34.061 --> 00:48:38.020
We ask them to keep their mics and cameras
switched off so they're not interfering

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.891
or disturbing the session or engaging
with the tester in any way during that.

00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:45.744
The one limitation of that is
when we do testing with people

00:48:45.745 --> 00:48:47.775
who use screen magnification software is,
unfortunately,

00:48:47.775 --> 00:48:50.965
that does not get pulled
through in a screen share.

00:48:51.255 --> 00:48:54.155
That's because of the way
that the technology is impacting

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:55.506
the screen at their end.

00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:57.430
In that situation,

00:48:57.431 --> 00:49:00.940
when we're moderating that remotely,
what we'll ask the tester to do is really

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.180
to describe what it is
that they can see on their screen.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.651
Wherever possible,

00:49:05.652 --> 00:49:07.550
we try and do that sort
of testing in person,

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.380
because it's really great insight.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.319
Annabelle: Thank you so much, Lucy.

00:49:11.319 --> 00:49:12.970
It's been a really great session.

00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:16.841
