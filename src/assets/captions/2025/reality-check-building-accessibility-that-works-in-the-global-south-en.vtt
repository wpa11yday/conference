>> ALEXANDRA BLANCO: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.288
My name is Alexandra Blanco

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.759
and I'm a software test engineer
with Qualtrics.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.403
Thank you for joining us
for Reality Check: Building Accessibility

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:45.809
That Works in the Global South
with Yigakpoa Ikpae.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.439
Yiga is an open-source advocate
and technologist working

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.290
at the intersection of open data,
accessibility,

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.600
digital equity, and sustainability.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.238
At CHAOSS Project,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.190
Yiga serves as a co-chair
of the project management team

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.589
and a maintainer
in the accessibility team,

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.089
helping improve metrics
for assessing the health

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.960
and sustainability
of open-source communities.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.770
As COO at CLENT Africa,
she collaborates using

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.280
open-source climate data platforms
and energy access tools

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.999
for community-driven resilience
and environmental justice.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.100
She also works on civic tech initiatives
that enhance government transparency

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.270
using open data.

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:29.039
Aside from contributing to and leading
at various open-source projects,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.686
Yiga is a global speaker
and mentors marginalized persons

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:34.469
trying to find their way in tech.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.310
Please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&A section

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.690

>> YIGAKPOA IKPAE: Okay.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.009
Hi, everyone.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.909
Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.469
I'll be talking
on Reality Check: Building Accessibility

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.899
That Works in the Global South.

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.814
My name is Yigakpoa Ikpae,

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:14.372
and I hope that this talk
will be below 40 minutes.

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.059
You're welcome.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.245
Fun fact about Yiga, because, of course,

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:26.587
accessibility doesn't always have
to be that serious, right?

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:28.232
Yes,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.052
I am a fine artist.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.729
When I have the time, I paint
with acrylic and mixed media.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.849
My works have found homes
with collectors in Africa,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.919
United States of America,
and the Middle East.

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:50.177
I've led various open-source projects
across global tech communities

00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:51.659
and here in Africa.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.004
I help to ensure that digital spaces
are inclusive for everyone.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.058
I find joy in mentoring various women,
various newcomers in tech,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.189
people that have been marginalized,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.759
and people that are finding their way

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.960
into the tech industry.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.990
I believe that mentoring helps people
get to their destinations faster.

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.010
I'm also passionate about leadership

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.870
and impact.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.823
I currently lead strategy

00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:34.341
at an open-source organization
focused on governance,

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.127
in addition to being the chief
of operations at CLENT Africa.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.899
I am building My Life As Yiga,
a YouTube channel and online community

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.130
that explores technology, social change,
and growth, all aspects of human growth.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.960
I do my best thinking
with a glass of fresh juice,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.289
a blank page just in case I need
to sketch something,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.070
and gospel music playing softly
in the background.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.139
The last thing I'd like to say
is a fun fact about me is,

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.820
who doesn't love pets, right?

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:19.461
I love pets, and I'm hoping
that we have a couple of people here

00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:21.579
that have pets as well.

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.360
Yes, welcome again to my talk
and thank you for staying.

00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:33.330
The essence of this talk,
the whole theme of this talk

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:37.415
is that we'll be confronting the gap

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:41.121
between global accessibility ideals

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.899
and the lived realities
of people like us in the Global South.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.778
It will interest you to know
that the Global South

00:05:50.778 --> 00:05:56.279
doesn't just consist of countries
in Africa,

00:05:56.677 --> 00:06:01.949
it also consists of countries
in Latin America, South Asia,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.290
and Southeast Asia.

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.425
My goal is to ensure
that WordPress developers,

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:13.050
designers, community leaders,

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:18.719
and everyone that cares
about accessibility lives here

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.909
with context,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.249
and the right strategies
to create digital accessibility

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.039
that genuinely works
even in low-resource environments.

00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:36.436
Yes, that's my goal of this talk.

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:43.408
I'd like you to right now imagine a person
with disability trying to reach staff

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.249
for healthcare online,
but this time around,

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:52.950
they're using a pass-me-down phone.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.867
I'll call that a second hand phone
regardless of it being Android

00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:01.289
or it being an iPhone,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.550
and guess what?

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.730
It has 2G internet.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.035
The site takes such a long time to load,
and that's if it loads at all.

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:15.869
That means that there's no alt text,
there's no labels,

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.990
no structure, because, I mean,
we're trying to get the sites

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:20.909
to even load, right?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.859
That brings us to a big,
big, big reality check,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.910
which is that accessibility
isn't just about compliance with WCAG,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.500
it's about equity.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.196
The best practices
we talk about in the Global North

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:44.625
often assume stable broadband,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.150
modern hardware, consistent power.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:00.073
I cackle because, of course, I live
in a place where there are power outages.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.078
I know some people here can imagine that,
but yes,

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:05.789
welcome to the Global South.

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:11.093
The Global North often assumes
these conditions.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.689
The issue is that when we look closely
at the Global South,

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:23.519
you find that these global guidelines

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:29.670
from the Global North often collide
with our realities on ground,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.270
right?

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.149
Some of them include
limited policy enforcement,

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:40.920
lack of localized design thinking,
it would shock you.

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:47.370
At the end of the day,
what is the purpose of this talk?

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.249
I think I want us to examine
what accessibility really means

00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:55.830
when the environment is far from ideal

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:02.399
and how we can use WordPress to build
an accessibility that actually works

00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:05.489
for everyone everywhere.

00:09:07.369 --> 00:09:10.259
I divided this talk into various parts.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.481
The first part talks
about the landscape and key challenges,

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:18.930
so it helps you understand
the Global South landscape

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:23.339
and the key challenges that we face,
and I'll try to run through it very fast.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:29.241
The first thing here
is global accessibility in numbers, right?

00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:30.990
Because we're trying to compare

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:35.398
the Global South
and the Global North, so we will take

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.649
the general global accessibility
in numbers.

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:43.560
We have over 1.3 billion people
worldwide experiencing

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:45.329
some form of disability.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.070
More than 80% of them live
in the Global South,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.670
and like I said before,
the Global South consists of Africa,

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:57.989
Latin America, South Asia,
and parts of Southeast Asia.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.335
Yet most accessibility
research frameworks,

00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:08.009
technologies, and best practices
are developed in the Global North,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.510
creating a mismatch
in assumptions and context.

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:15.659
The source of this data,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.624
source of this research
is UCL accessibility

00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:23.588
in the Global South panel reports 2021.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.210
The second landscape
is raw data from the field.

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:39.569
We have a 2020 study
of 79 Tanzanian e-government websites.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.570
Tanzania is a country in Africa.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:51.389
Part of what that study showed us
is that 100% of those 79 websites

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.971
failed WCAG 2.0 accessibility checks.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.049
Can you imagine that?

00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:03.930
65% had missing alt text
on critical images.

00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:12.958
52 of the 79 had homepages
that took longer than five seconds

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.909
to load on broadband.

00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:24.838
Common issues with these 79 websites
included missing headings,

00:11:24.838 --> 00:11:30.059
poor keyboard navigation,
and heavy unoptimized graphics.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.589
Another 2025 global study reviewing

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:40.400
over 100,000 websites
in 10 Global South countries

00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:43.270
found that only 40%

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:46.709
met even the most basic
accessibility criteria.

00:11:47.864 --> 00:11:51.661
100,000 websites,
10 Global South countries,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.889
and only 40% met the basic criteria.

00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:57.129
That's interesting.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.029
Average load times were two times slower
than comparable Global North sites.

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:09.540
Pages were often viewed using
heavy JavaScript frameworks

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.390
without fallbacks for low-end devices.

00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:16.649
I'd just like to point out
that these aren't isolated cases.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.839
They really do reflect
a pattern of inaccessibility driven

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.039
by limited resources, awareness,
and policy enforcement.

00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:32.803
Now, the third thing

00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:35.715
on the landscape and key challenges,

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:42.989
here, I have a table that tries
to show the constraints,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.900
the real-world application
in Global South,

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.300
and why these global standards
do not fit in the Global South.

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:55.823
Part of that constraint,
the first constraint

00:12:55.824 --> 00:12:59.850
that I have here is unreliable internet.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.433
It would interest you to know
that majority of the population

00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:10.650
still use 2G, 3G networks.

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:15.239
There's high latency,
there's a lot of data caps,

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:21.419
and we can't assume stable broadband.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.680
Heavy ARIA widgets will break,
of course,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.735
when you're trying to load them with 2G.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.393
The second constraint is low-end devices.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:42.269
Again, it would interest you
to note that outdated phones dominate

00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:44.039
the markets here.

00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:48.605
That means that modern scripts,
animations,

00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:53.110
and JavaScript-heavy sites fail
to render most times

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.669
with people in the Global South.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.239
We have energy poverty.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.630
Of course,
that was why I cackled in the first page,

00:14:07.109 --> 00:14:09.360
because there are power outages.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.840
Like it or not,
there's always power outages.

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:17.789
There's always something taking
the lights away.

00:14:18.912 --> 00:14:22.559
That means that there's also going
to be limited battery life.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:25.989
Of course,

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:31.094
these global standards
like autoplaying a video,

00:14:31.095 --> 00:14:35.039
these things that you would think are
a good addition,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.239
like making videos autoplay
when you get to them,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.748
unfortunately,
for people like us in the Global South,

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:47.244
that means that our battery might be low,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.191
we might be trying
to reserve our battery, right?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.820
It's not just that,

00:14:54.848 --> 00:15:00.779
but the heavy animations as well
on websites drains usability.

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:04.499
The fourth thing on my list

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:09.929
that I put under constraint
is limited technical capacity.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.830
Again,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.679
it's very interesting,

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:20.430
but few devs are trained in accessibility,
and fewer devs even want to get trained

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:21.779
in accessibility.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.848
The reason why these global standards
don't fit is because,

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:34.919
yes, these guidelines exist,
but no one implements them.

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.599
The other constraint
is weak policy enforcement.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.760
Accessibility laws exist
in some places, not everywhere,

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:49.739
but they aren't enforced
even in the places where they exist.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.890
That means that there's no accountability
or auditing mechanisms.

00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:01.830
The sixth constraint
I have here is linguistic diversity.

00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:07.530
There's thousands and thousands
and thousands of local languages

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:10.013
in Africa alone.

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:15.209
This means that literacy levels vary,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.205
and that implies that screen readers,

00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:23.211
of course,
often lack local language support,

00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.928
because if there are fewer devs building

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.237
that know these languages,
but they are not building

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:35.640
for accessibility,
then, of course, they would not think

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:41.579
about local language support
for screen readers.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.439
There's also the assistive tech gaps,
older and unavailable assistive devices,

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:52.230
and then there's also
limited compatibility

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:55.859
with new web technologies
with that problem.

00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:02.730
The last but not the least problem
or constraint is economic constraints.

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:06.546
Small budgets,
limited tech infrastructure.

00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:07.644
What does that mean?

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:11.460
That means that the average person
in the Global South

00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:18.300
lives on less than $10 a day,

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:25.380
and $10 is a huge figure,
but I'm just keeping it at that.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.195
That tells you
that they have bills to pay,

00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:33.056
they have rent to cover,

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:36.253
they have a million
and one things to do,

00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:38.369
to say the least, with that money,

00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:43.920
and, of course, tech infrastructure
is not the first thing on their mind.

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:46.743
Why does that not fit?

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.299
It means that accessibility
is deprioritized in design,

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:52.620
in development,

00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:56.519
so even for founders that want
to build something beautiful,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.852
they would rather prioritize solving
the actual problem

00:18:02.853 --> 00:18:05.819
and leaving accessibility
as an afterthought.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.059
I said that to say
that the Global South isn't just behind,

00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:16.259
it's simply operating
under entirely different constraints.

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:18.819
The part two,

00:18:19.379 --> 00:18:22.469
principles for building
accessibility that works.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.869
Principle one I have here
is progressive enhancements first.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.040
Something that would help us is for us
to build for the weakest conditions first,

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:38.579
so HTML that works offline.

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.079
Why?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080
Because,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.069
remember, there are data caps,

00:18:44.743 --> 00:18:48.989
or HTML that works with limited data,

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:54.479
and then we can add CSS
and JavaScript only as enhancements.

00:18:55.229 --> 00:18:59.342
An example would be that a form
should be usable without JavaScript,

00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:04.439
that's because scripts
only improve the user experience.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.619
With this, I would say that accessibility
is not necessarily about doing more.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.799
It's about doing what matters most first.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.521
Second principle I have here
is performance accessibility.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.611
In low bandwidth environments,
slow equals inaccessible

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:30.480
because people
will just bounce off the site.

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:32.207
The bounce rates will be higher.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.690
What does that mean?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.690
Optimize for size.

00:19:36.749 --> 00:19:39.929
Target less than 2MB page load on mobile.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.730
Use image compression,
lazy loading, caching,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.769
content delivery, network edge delivery.

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:55.819
Defer noncritical scripts
and remove unused CSS.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.613
Avoid autoplaying videos
or animation-heavy libraries.

00:20:00.882 --> 00:20:06.170
Animation-heavy JavaScript libraries
should be avoided as much as possible.

00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:15.530
Third principle here
is context-aware WCAG and ARIA.

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:22.129
It would be preferable
to have semantic HTML elements.

00:20:23.809 --> 00:20:29.600
We can use ARIA only when necessary
and test on older screen readers

00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:32.839
or devices that are used locally.

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:34.669
For example,

00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:39.470
you have older devices
and you're building for the Global South

00:20:39.499 --> 00:20:41.059
or in the Global South.

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.369
It would make more sense to test

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:51.440
these things on older screen readers
or the devices that you find the most

00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:56.326
in the community or in the country
that you will be building for,

00:20:56.334 --> 00:21:01.143
that is if it's a locally focused product.

00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:08.689
Avoid complex widgets like custom sliders
or models that break keyboard navigation.

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:10.969
Prioritize navigation,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.193
forms, and reading flow
over flashy widgets.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.350
The fourth principle is
to design with, not for.

00:21:19.073 --> 00:21:22.249
Of course, we've heard that a lot today,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.158
but I like to reemphasize it and say
that we should include persons

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:31.909
with disabilities
from the start of our design process,

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:34.610
so testing real environments,

00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:39.390
the exact phone they're using,
the older OS.

00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:42.649
We don't have to come
with our own devices.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.300
Use what they use.

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:46.583
Test your product on their phones.

00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:48.710
Ask them to test it on their phones.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.959
Use their internet.

00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:53.630
What do they use on a daily basis?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.929
Then use co-design workshops
with local disability groups.

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:06.530
Observe how actual users
of your product interact with your site

00:22:07.489 --> 00:22:10.460
because it's nothing about us without us.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.749
One thing I want us
to remember is that simple,

00:22:14.804 --> 00:22:19.370
native, and fast will always beat fancy
and fragile,

00:22:20.689 --> 00:22:25.640
and in the Global South, considering
every kilobyte is accessibility inclusion.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.388
The fifth principle I have here

00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:30.732
under principles
for building accessibility

00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:33.800
that works is local capacity building.

00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:38.540
It will be nice
if we can train WordPress developers

00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:42.079
in basic accessibility testing
and inclusive design.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.960
What if we translate accessibility guides
into local languages

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.676
or share translator guides?

00:22:49.849 --> 00:22:52.460
For example, do we have

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.310
accessibility guides in French,

00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:01.976
in Portuguese,

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:08.840
in various languages around the world?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.809
I wonder how many exist.

00:23:13.069 --> 00:23:17.081
How about we host accessibility hackathons
or meetups

00:23:17.435 --> 00:23:20.150
in our working groups or communities?

00:23:20.749 --> 00:23:25.129
We can also create mentorship
or peer review programs

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.529
for accessibility themes that pop up

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.440
or that people are building,
because the best accessibility tool,

00:23:33.442 --> 00:23:36.170
in my opinion,
is a trained local developer.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:41.449
We should build modular
and maintainable architecture,

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:45.095
so accessibility layers built
into your theme

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:51.110
or your plugin is such a huge addition
and a good addition.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.500
Submit your checks in your CI/CD pipeline.

00:23:58.279 --> 00:24:02.179
Document accessibility patterns
and update them regularly,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.978
and maintain
a minimum viable accessibility baseline

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:08.390
for all your projects.

00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:16.211
That means
that you basically tell your team

00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:21.783
that you're going to have
the basic accessibility checks done.

00:24:24.128 --> 00:24:26.128
It has to pass whatever they're building

00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:29.704
has to pass through the right testing

00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:36.075
and that is what is meant
to give them the scorecard,

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:41.359
and if it doesn't pass it,
it doesn't go through.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.660
The other thing is we're in the--

00:24:49.751 --> 00:24:53.630
AI is now more than a buzzword,
I would say,

00:24:54.229 --> 00:24:58.654
so we can't say people shouldn't use AI.

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:01.259
However,

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:06.847
it would be great if people

00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:10.249
can use AI intelligently and not blindly.

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:13.999
For example, respect local context.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.639
The culture is different.

00:25:16.939 --> 00:25:19.820
The languages are most likely different.

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:22.820
The context might be different too.

00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:27.500
The symbols, languages,
and reading habits will differ,

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:31.228
as opposed
to when you just run something through AI

00:25:31.228 --> 00:25:33.229
and you think that it's plug and play.

00:25:33.274 --> 00:25:34.790
No, it might not be.

00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:38.780
Combine accessibility
with local design culture

00:25:39.063 --> 00:25:40.850
to help drive adoption.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.289
The eighth principle is
to use AI intelligently.

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:47.236
Uh-oh.

00:25:48.577 --> 00:25:51.894
The eighth principle is to use AI
to assist,

00:25:51.972 --> 00:25:56.239
not replace accessibility efforts.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.819
What do I mean by that?

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.909
Auto-captioning for local dialects,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.388
you can use AI-generated alt text

00:26:06.694 --> 00:26:10.011
but ensure that your reviews
are done by humans,

00:26:11.312 --> 00:26:18.782
and encourage development
that can be done

00:26:18.782 --> 00:26:21.598
or that is done in the local language

00:26:23.283 --> 00:26:26.030
of the people
that will be using the product,

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:28.819
so underrepresented languages
like I wrote.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.359
Be cautious.

00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:35.266
AI often fails to recognize local culture
or contextual meaning

00:26:35.731 --> 00:26:42.259
because it's working with data
from most likely another world, right?

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:46.481
It was built with data
from maybe the Global North,

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.572
maybe somewhere else,

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:52.039
but it might not be built with data

00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:53.617
from the Global South.

00:26:55.764 --> 00:26:59.241
With this, I say
that AI can scale accessibility

00:26:59.677 --> 00:27:02.929
but only if it is grounded in human review

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:06.530
because we don't want
to compound the problem,

00:27:06.589 --> 00:27:09.409
increase the problem
that we're trying to solve.

00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.183
WordPress implementation strategy,
so that's part three

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:23.120
of this will be implementation strategies
that we can use when building

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:25.729
with WordPress.

00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:29.599
Start with accessibility-ready themes.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.309
You can find them here.

00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:36.928
Check for semantic HTML5 structure
and skip links.

00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:42.319
We can avoid themes that rely solely
on visual page builders

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.238
or JavaScript-heavy frameworks.

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:45.680
I know I've said that a lot.

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:52.370
The other thing we can do is to test
with screen readers like NVDA

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.930
or VoiceOver.

00:27:55.383 --> 00:27:59.569
Accessibility plugins
should be verified and lightweight.

00:28:01.653 --> 00:28:03.379
WordPress accessibility,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.910
add skip links, focus indicators,
and ARIA helpers.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.468
Accessibility checker scans posts
and pages for WCAG 2.1 issues.

00:28:17.127 --> 00:28:21.530
One-click accessibility adds toolbars
for contrast,

00:28:21.589 --> 00:28:23.479
font resize, and so on.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.819
You can choose any of them, really,

00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:28.970
but it depends
on what you're trying to do.

00:28:29.449 --> 00:28:36.620
Accessible WordPress toolbar improves
site usability for vision-impaired users.

00:28:37.489 --> 00:28:38.489
Again,

00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:44.118
I would like to reiterate
that we should avoid over-reliance

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.829
on AI overlays

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.976
without using manual verification,
because manual verification

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:54.709
is so, so, so, so important,

00:28:55.748 --> 00:28:59.839
and we don't want to bypass that.

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:08.125
The third implementation strategy
will be content authoring workflow,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.050
so the people that write
the content for your website,

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:13.079
for your app,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:19.280
part of your baseline check done,
or would I say

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.319
part of your baseline approval should be
that there's alt text for every image.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.550
They write meaningful text,

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.849
so instead of "click here,"
for example, it could be "Read more

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.025
about WordPress Accessibility Day 2025."

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:41.329
They add transcripts and captions
for all videos and podcasts.

00:29:42.349 --> 00:29:48.056
They avoid color-only indicators
and use patterns or labels.

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:52.039
They maintain
consistent heading hierarchy.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.280
That means the H1s,
the H2s, the H3s, the H4s,

00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:03.061
it has to be consistent on your website,
and I also put a checklist for editors.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.620
When you're checking it, of course,
the alt text on all media,

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.679
descriptive links,
captions and transcripts,

00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:12.930
keyboard-friendly navigation.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:18.660
The fourth thing on the part three
is testing and quality assurance.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.250
It's so important.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.307
Combine automated
and manual keyboard testing.

00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:28.650
Use your axe, use your WAVE,
your Lighthouse,

00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:31.500
but make sure that you do
your manual testing.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.519
Test on low-end Android devices
with Chrome Lite Mode.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.949
Chrome has this beautiful version,
the Lite Mode.

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:43.470
Use your local screen readers.

00:30:43.529 --> 00:30:45.810
TalkBack on Android, for example.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.049
Simulate 3G network speeds.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:54.150
Please do that for us during testing
with Chrome DevTools.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.360
Test with real assistive technologies

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:04.290
and gather feedback from real users
with disabilities living

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.180
in the Global South.

00:31:06.569 --> 00:31:08.305
That would help us a lot.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:14.069
The other thing I'd like to point out
is performance optimization

00:31:14.429 --> 00:31:16.620
for Global South users.

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:22.379
Use caching, remove unnecessary plugins
and tracking scripts.

00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:25.440
Your documentation and team training,

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:31.109
maintain an internal documentation
on accessibility do and don'ts

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.750
by creating an accessibility checklist.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.099
My vision for this call to action

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.679
will be that I want to see

00:31:47.273 --> 00:31:51.298
in the next decade that people living

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:56.158
with disabilities in the Global South
are able to access WordPress sites

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:57.179
that load fast,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.040
read clearly, and are usable
with screen readers even on 2G networks.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:08.308
Local developers across Africa, Asia,
Latin America are leading

00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:10.170
the accessibility innovation.

00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:15.299
Governments and businesses
are enforcing accessibility policies.

00:32:15.689 --> 00:32:18.162
Users with disabilities
in the Global South

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.489
no longer feel left behind

00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:23.189
but are leading
the digital transformation.

00:32:23.731 --> 00:32:29.910
Our call to action for developers will be
to test your site under low bandwidth

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.500
and with screen readers.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:36.119
Content creators treat accessibility
as part of storytelling by using

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.240
inclusive writing and ensuring
that every post passes

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.700
an accessibility check.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.139
Policymakers should push
for mandatory accessibility standards

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.279
in government procurement
and enforce accessibility standards

00:32:50.309 --> 00:32:52.860
for all public-facing websites.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.739
Community builders, community managers,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.973
please host accessibility audits
and awareness days at your meetups.

00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:06.230
I don't believe that accessibility
is a Western export.

00:33:06.329 --> 00:33:09.630
It's a global human right
that should be localized.

00:33:10.357 --> 00:33:13.531
It should be light, fast, human-centered

00:33:13.532 --> 00:33:16.632
and built
for conditions people actually live in

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:20.400
and with people who understand
the concept.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.968
I've also listed some of the resources
that I mentioned

00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:28.469
and they are linked in my slide.

00:33:28.979 --> 00:33:32.970
Thank you so much
for listening to this talk.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:34.829
If you have any questions,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.069
I'd love to hear from you,
experiences, please

00:33:38.879 --> 00:33:40.922
ask them now.

00:33:41.129 --> 00:33:42.129
Thank you.

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:47.459
You can connect to me

00:33:48.419 --> 00:33:51.869
on my social platforms
or LinkedIn or GitHub.

00:33:55.589 --> 00:33:56.635
Thank you so much.

00:33:56.639 --> 00:33:59.730
I'll be in the background waiting
for any questions.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.260
See you around.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.470
Bye.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.810
Alexandra Blanco: Hi, everyone.
I'm Alexandra.

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:12.690
I'll be your MC for this Q&A session.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.059
First of all, thank you so much, Yiga,
for this amazing topic that you explained.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.760
I think it's so, so, so relevant

00:34:21.269 --> 00:34:27.448
how we at the Global South have
different considerations in regards

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.799
to accessibility.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.160
Yes, thank you so much
for taking in on that.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.149
I saw that you answered
a couple of questions in the Q&A section.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.178
Just want to remind folks,
again, if you have any other,

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.340
you can still put them in the Q&A box.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.380
I want you to answer them live as well,
verbally,

00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:50.099
the ones that you already put
in the chat, because I think

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.446
they're really great questions.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.809
The first one comes
from Nassim, and they ask,

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.530
"How can we ensure accessibility
for multilingual websites,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.149
especially when dealing with local scripts
and right-to-left languages?

00:35:05.779 --> 00:35:06.779
Yigakpoa Ikpae: Okay.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.935
Thank you so much, Alexandra.

00:35:10.587 --> 00:35:13.289
Nassim, as I said
in the chat, and thank you,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.118
everyone, for listening, by the way.

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:18.780
I'm so happy with the feedback
that I'm getting from everybody.

00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:22.949
This talk is so important to me.
Over to Nassim's question.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:31.558
I would say that when we talk
about ensuring accessibility

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:33.149
for multilingual websites,

00:35:33.449 --> 00:35:35.820
like I said,
one of the things I highlighted is that,

00:35:36.149 --> 00:35:40.769
in Africa alone, there are
over 2,000 languages.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:44.910
You can imagine
what that means for Brazil.

00:35:45.299 --> 00:35:47.880
Brazil is just one country
in Latin America.

00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:50.429
What that means for Asia
and all of that stuff.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.320
What that means is that,

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:53.938
as developers,

00:35:53.939 --> 00:36:01.920
we should try to use proper
language attributes in our HTML tags.

00:36:03.025 --> 00:36:05.788
Then, for mixed language content,
for example,

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:09.239
you're trying to write something
in Portuguese and English.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.590
You can use inline language
attributes so that screen readers

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:16.545
can switch pronunciations correctly.

00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:21.862
You should also support
right-to-left layouts.

00:36:22.259 --> 00:36:25.198
That means that you ensure
that your themes and plugins

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:28.949
fully support ASEA languages,
such as Arabic,

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.040
Hebrew, Urdu, different languages.

00:36:32.549 --> 00:36:36.990
Also, if you're a theme builder
or plugin builder,

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.320
one of the things
that you can do, because,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:47.039
for one, we're aware that languages
in the Global South might not be available

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.170
in certain themes and plugins
that are already built.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.970
It can also be something
that you'd consider doing.

00:36:54.539 --> 00:37:00.810
One of the ways to do that is
to get themes to translate for you,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.170
translation themes,
so that it can be localized

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.960
in the languages
that would suit your users,

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.520
especially if you are developing
for that user context.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.551
I just said that to support
the part where I said we need

00:37:16.552 --> 00:37:20.181
to support right-to-left layouts
in our themes and plugins.

00:37:20.182 --> 00:37:21.689
I was just buttressing that.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.759
Then after you try to localize,
you test with native speakers

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.648
to patch subtle issues,

00:37:28.649 --> 00:37:32.430
because as we all know,
there are various linguas,

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:35.550
various jokes that can pass
in various languages.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:42.929
If you do not get a native speaker
to translate or to give you

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:48.191
what it means in that context,
you might miss the actual meaning of it.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.429
We don't also want to do that.

00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:54.989
Then the other thing I would say
is WordPress

00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:00.517
has amazing multilingual tools already
that have accessibility in mind.

00:38:00.518 --> 00:38:05.403
Polylang is one of them, TranslatePress,
WPML.

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.390
These plugins can manage
multiple languages,

00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:13.739
but we need to also always check
that the outputs are accessible,

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.422
the outputs accessible markups,
and properly update

00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:19.830
the language attributes.

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:23.280
Then, like I said before,
I just want to buttress it again,

00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:25.949
provide context-aware translations.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.269
Make sure that you're working
with actual human translators

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.320
who understand the language
and accessibility nuances

00:38:35.549 --> 00:38:38.670
so that they are meaningful
in that context.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:44.340
Another thing we can do is test
with assistive technologies

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:50.752
in various multiple languages,
verify the reading order,

00:38:50.873 --> 00:38:52.590
the pronunciation,

00:38:52.649 --> 00:38:56.665
the layout direction, just verifying
that everything is consistent

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.340
with what it's supposed to be.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520
Of course,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.738
less design with inclusivity
from the start.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.078
If we're going to plan on doing this,
we should include

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:17.970
multilingual accessibility early
in the design phase

00:39:17.997 --> 00:39:21.217
so that we're not doing it
as an afterthought.

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:24.478
Thank you.
Alexandra: Yes, thank you.

00:39:24.479 --> 00:39:27.719
I feel like that's so important
about languages.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.099
We all have different nuances
that are not translatable

00:39:32.939 --> 00:39:36.180
on the first
like sketch of whatever we're doing.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.389
Always important to keep that in mind.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.950
Then the next question comes
from Sharon, and they say,

00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:46.920
"Hi, you mentioned heavy ARIA widgets.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.190
Can you say a little more
about what they are?"

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:52.980
Yigakpoa: Okay, thank you.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.410
Let me try to get the name again.

00:39:55.672 --> 00:39:57.911
I want to just quickly get the name.
Oh, Sharon.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.882
Oh, okay.
Hi, Sharon.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:08.908
When we talk about heavy ARIA widgets,
we're simply referring to components

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:13.319
that rely heavily
on accessible rich internet applications.

00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:16.768
That means
that your custom drop-down menus

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:17.769
with divs.

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:21.840
We know how we're building,
where we're building,

00:40:21.899 --> 00:40:24.330
and we use divs and all of that stuff.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:29.579
Then your tab panels,
your sliders, your accordions,

00:40:29.879 --> 00:40:33.403
they use a lot of accessible
rich internet applications,

00:40:33.404 --> 00:40:38.460
which is shortened as ARIA,
to simulate interactivity.

00:40:38.699 --> 00:40:43.199
Now, that is good for people
that are not living

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.149
with certain form of disability.

00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:48.898
I think that generally,

00:40:48.899 --> 00:40:51.840
and this was
a part of another talk that I gave,

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.259
I think that as humans,
we should be building

00:40:55.469 --> 00:40:56.469
for the future,

00:40:56.519 --> 00:41:00.629
not just for the now,
because we all want to grow old one day.

00:41:01.043 --> 00:41:03.869
The truth is, people
think that accessibility

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.828
or living with disability
is just for people that were born

00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:08.829
with disabilities,

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:12.414
but you never know
what old age brings to you.

00:41:12.749 --> 00:41:17.129
Imagine being a tech person all your life,
you've worked on the computer,

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.839
and suddenly you're older,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.808
or you get an accident,
and you can no longer use those things

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:24.961
that you love.
Just putting it out there.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:31.317
While they are easy and nice to have
for people that are not living

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:36.239
with disabilities, we also want
to ensure that all of this interactivity

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.040
that's ARIA role simulate can be--

00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:45.784
Yes, we're all temporarily abled.
I agree with Eugene.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:52.671
We all want to ensure
that these things also work for PWDs.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:42:00.419
Some of the reasons why they are called
heavy is simply because these things

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.220
require many ARIA attributes.

00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:05.959
For example, a role
can be equal to button,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.064
ARIA expanded is equal to true,
ARIA controls is equal to maybe panel

00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:12.285
one, and so on.

00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:15.299
These are linguas
for the developers to understand,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.800
but they just replicate
what a native element already does

00:42:19.919 --> 00:42:24.783
by default.
As simple as that, that's what they do.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.619
Another thing is that they demand
constant maintenance.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.130
I mean, if a developer forgets something,

00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:36.809
accessibility just breaks down
for screen reader users,

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.420
and that's what it is.

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:44.442
They're also very difficult
to translate and to test,

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:53.190
particularly when we're talking
about multilingual environments,

00:42:53.554 --> 00:42:56.342
which is what this talk is focused on.

00:42:56.639 --> 00:42:57.879
Talking about the Global South,

00:42:58.021 --> 00:43:02.849
there should be over 2,500 languages
here, and so it's going to be very hard

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.879
to test, to translate,
and stuff like that.

00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:09.063
It just increases the complexity,

00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:13.401
keyboard navigation often fails,
performance and translation issues.

00:43:13.739 --> 00:43:17.600
That's kind of it.
I hope I answered your question, Sharon.

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:21.058
Alexandra: Yes, I think
that was really insightful.

00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:23.069
Thanks for that awesome explanation.

00:43:23.849 --> 00:43:26.099
We have another question from Nassim.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.100
They ask,

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.289
and I think you already touched on this,
but maybe you can give it

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.640
a little bit more depth.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:38.370
"Are there specific WordPress plugins
or practices you recommend to improve

00:43:38.429 --> 00:43:41.460
accessibility
in resource-limited environments?"

00:43:42.852 --> 00:43:44.423
Yigakpoa: Okay.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.869
Thank you, Nassim,
and thank you, Alexandra.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.218
I can start by saying
that there are definitely a lot of plugins

00:43:56.219 --> 00:44:01.230
and themes that you can use
for these environments.

00:44:01.709 --> 00:44:04.710
I would advise that you can start
with a lightweight,

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:09.018
accessible theme,
so default WordPress themes like 2024.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.420
We all know 2024.

00:44:10.522 --> 00:44:13.269
It feels like every year,
WordPress comes with a new one.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.507
We're expecting 2026 WordPress.

00:44:16.508 --> 00:44:23.426
2024, 2023, they all follow
the accessibility-ready standards.

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:26.849
Of course, it's from WordPress,
and they load very quickly

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.290
on low bandwidth.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.964
Another thing I would say is
that we can avoid

00:44:33.965 --> 00:44:36.210
bloated multipurpose themes

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.753
and prioritize themes that are labeled
as accessibility-ready

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.289
in the WordPress theme directory.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:48.962
That's also very important.
It takes off a lot of themes.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.179
Another thing, as a WordPress developer,
is that you want to keep

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.940
your plugins minimal and purposeful.

00:44:57.198 --> 00:45:00.270
I mean, we all know that plugins
can be heavy on the website,

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.110
but again, when you're building
with accessibility in mind,

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.713
you need to also keep

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:12.255
that more so at the front,
at your forefront,

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.770
than at the back of your mind,

00:45:14.099 --> 00:45:16.616
if you get the joke.

00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:22.649
Because every plugin adds some weight
and potential accessibility issues,

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.171
so you want to choose the tools
that can serve performance

00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:28.409
and accessibility at the same time.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:35.948
Certain plugins that I would recommend
would be WordPress Accessibility,

00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:37.911
WP Accessibility.

00:45:38.249 --> 00:45:41.663
There's One Click Accessibility.

00:45:43.215 --> 00:45:47.448
There's Accessibility Checker
by Equalize Digital.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.042
I agree with that.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.990
We can also enable Media Replace.

00:45:57.149 --> 00:45:59.854
Those are some of the things
that we can use.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.088
Enable semantic HTML instead
of heavy ARIA widgets.

00:46:05.189 --> 00:46:06.509
I've already said that.

00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:10.560
We can optimize for low bandwidth
and mobile users.

00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:14.460
We can compress images
using tools like Smush,

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.589
or TinyPNG, or a native WordPress image
of optimization,

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.960
and then enable lazy loading
for images and videos.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.847
There's a lot of things
that we can do just to make it better

00:46:27.848 --> 00:46:30.661
and make it better
and make it another step better.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.700
Thank you so much.

00:46:34.499 --> 00:46:35.579
Alexandra: Okay, thank you.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.600
I believe we have time
for one last question that just arrived.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.369
This might have to be quick,
Yiga, but I would love to ask you this.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.439
This one is anonymous,

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:51.239
and is, "Is there a theme that has
accessibility built in that you recommend?

00:46:51.569 --> 00:46:54.419
I read some articles
that Kadence was a good start,

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.236
but curious of your experiences
or thoughts."

00:47:00.581 --> 00:47:03.674
Yigakpoa: Thank you very much, anonymous.

00:47:03.675 --> 00:47:09.270
Thank you for listening.
I haven't tried Kadence,

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.619
but I have heard about it.

00:47:14.969 --> 00:47:18.300
I've heard, and I've read
that Kadence is one of them,

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:32.699
but we also need
to confirm the customization.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.699
I know that it has advanced customization

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.389
in the premium features, so I've read.

00:47:39.719 --> 00:47:44.736
Like I said, I've not tested it,
but with certain advanced customization,

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:48.823
there is more complexity.

00:47:50.369 --> 00:47:54.591
With more options that you add,
you might risk introducing

00:47:55.229 --> 00:47:59.913
accessibility issues
if it's not managed properly.

00:48:01.529 --> 00:48:05.427
I would advise using
starter templates if they have those.

00:48:07.649 --> 00:48:12.373
Importing a theme sometimes
that may include demo content

00:48:13.139 --> 00:48:16.632
or layouts that need
tweaking for accessibility.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.163
Sometimes those have hidden
content, redundant scripts.

00:48:21.509 --> 00:48:25.469
You can actually import them,
check it, see what it feels like,

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:29.730
especially if they have the demo starter
templates that you can check and try out.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.890
Again, when you talk
about themes to consider,

00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:39.755
I would still talk about 2024,
talk about Neve,

00:48:39.756 --> 00:48:44.098
talk about Storefront,
it's a WooCommerce theme.

00:48:45.382 --> 00:48:47.139
Those are the themes.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.609
Yes, I've read about Kadence,
and I've read that performance

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:55.079
is lean, it's good,
it does a lean setup, it's flexible,

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.357
and then I've read
that accessibility features

00:48:57.358 --> 00:48:59.688
are a big thing,
but I haven't tried it myself.

00:49:00.209 --> 00:49:03.060
That's just the advice
I would give for you to check out

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.509
when using Kadence
or any other theme like that.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.048
Thank you.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.650
Alexandra: Thank you so much
for this talk.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.699
It was really amazing.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:16.559
Thanks for putting a spotlight
on the accessibility that we need

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.229
in the Global South.
It was really important.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.099
Thank you for everyone
who has been here for your questions.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.442
