00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.170
>> RODRIGO IBRAHIM: Hello everyone,
I'm Rodrigo Ibrahim.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.471
I'm a developer
with over 15 years of experience,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.400
and for the last few years,
my true passion

00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.350
has been digital accessibility.

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:03.313
I'm going to show you a simple checklist

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:06.710
based on the Brazilian
accessibility standards

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:13.521
and how you can use it in WordPress
to create websites that truly work

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.110
for everyone.

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.861
Our goal today is simple,
ensuring WordPress accessibility for all.

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:28.131
This isn't just a nice slogan,

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:29.881
it's the truth.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.651
Web accessibility isn't just about design,

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:39.080
it's about deciding
who can actually use your website.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.100
Think of it as a bridge that connects

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.460
your content to your users.

00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.160
If that bridge is broken,

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.290
we leave people out,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.990
but when we build it well,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.660
we welcome everyone.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.940
What we will do in this session.

00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:06.351
We will give you a practical checklist

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.382
based on the Brazilian
standard ABNT NBR 17225.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.650
You can use this tool
to test WordPress themes and plugins

00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.050
for real accessibility.

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.771
We're moving from talk to action.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.110
You will get clear steps

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.821
to create a more inclusive
WordPress experience.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
Let's begin.

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:40.248
Now, let's go deeper into our topic.

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:44.840
We know that accessibility
is like a bridge connecting us

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.550
to our users,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.051
but how do we make sure this bridge
is built correctly?

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.819
Here in Brazil,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.897
we have something
very important called ABNT.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.871
Think of it as the official organization
that creates the rule books

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.831
for how things should be made in Brazil.

00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:13.100
It's like a guide that ensures
quality and safety for everyone.

00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:18.445
For digital accessibility,
the specific rule book

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:24.632
we follow is called ABNT NBR 17225.

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:31.221
This is our Brazilian instruction manual
for building accessible websites.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.260
The best part.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.560
This manual doesn't use
complicated theories.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.771
It gives us a clear,
practical checklist of what to do.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:48.921
It takes the big idea of accessibility
for all and turns it

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.959
into simple steps we can actually follow.

00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:57.081
In the next slides,
I'll show you the most important items

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.461
from this checklist.

00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:05.751
You'll learn exactly what to look
for your WordPress themes and plugins

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.600
to make sure they work for everyone.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.021
Let's explore
these practical steps together.

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.940
Let's talk about the foundation
of our checklist.

00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:23.600
Our guide is built on strong rules
from the world and from Brazil.

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:28.972
The most important goal rule
is called WCAG.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.840
It's the international standard
for accessibility.

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.611
Here in Brazil,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.241
we have the ABNT standard,
which follows the same

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.187
as WCAG rules.

00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:52.070
To make it easy to remember,
WCAG is built on four simple principles.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.641
We call them POUR principles.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.931
Let me explain them very simply.

00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.831
Perceivable.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.950
Can users

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.361
see or hear the information?

00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:17.330
This includes things like test
for images and captions for videos.

00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.191
Operable.

00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:24.081
Can users use the website?

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:25.711
For example,

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:27.471
with a keyboard,

00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:29.180
not just a mouse.

00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.031
Understandable.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.701
Is the content easy

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.110
to understand?

00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:41.451
Is it clear and predictable?

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:44.962
Robust.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:52.311
Can the website work well
with different tools and technologies,

00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:55.131
like screen readers, for example?

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.060
These four principles are the foundation
for everything we will check.

00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:06.471
They guide all the technical points

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.100
in our list.

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.920
Let's look at how we apply them
to WordPress.

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.450
This is the ABNT document.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.470
The most important thing
to understand is its direct connection

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.071
to the international standard.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.480
The Web Content Accessibility Guideline.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:41.049
The Brazilian norm is essentially
a Brazilian version of WCAG.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.771
It uses the same rules
called success criteria,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:53.000
but presents them in a way
that's tailored for our context.

00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:58.580
These rules are organized
into three levels,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:08.391
which you can think
of as levels of completeness.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.270
Level A is the basic level.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.491
It's the absolute minimum.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.431
If you don't meet this,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.760
your site has critical barriers
that will prevent people

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.690
from using it at all.

00:09:29.874 --> 00:09:33.800
Level AA is the next step.

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:42.800
This is the level that most laws
and regulations around the world require.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:48.331
It removes many more barriers
and makes your site

00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:53.821
genuinely usable for a wide audience.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.550
This is our primary goal.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.781
Level AAA

00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:02.971
is the highest level.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.850
It's the most complete,

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.951
but also the most difficult to achieve

00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.550
for every single part of a website.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.351
It's a fantastic idea,

00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:18.751
but level AA
is what we realistically aim for.

00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:23.221
The entire purpose of Section 5
of this document,

00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:27.061
which is based on these levels,
is very practical.

00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:31.200
To make sure people
with different disabilities,

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:35.491
whatever related to vision,
hearing, movement,

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:36.961
or understanding,

00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:42.811
can actually use a website
successfully and independently.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.546
This document isn't just a theory.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.050
It's a functional guide to create

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.901
digital products that include

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.501
everyone.

00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:55.181
Now,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:02.310
let's take a look at how the ABNT standard
is practically organized.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.610
It's structured into clear,
actionable characters.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.671
Each focuses on a critical part
of the user experience.

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:19.643
This is the core of our checklist.

00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:21.301
For instance,

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:27.811
Chapter 5.1 on keyboard interaction

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.370
is fundamental.

00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.850
It's not just about using the tab key.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.060
It includes specific rules,

00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:45.569
like ensuring a visible focus indicator,
so users always know where they are

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.570
on the page.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:56.372
In 5.2, it says about images, this one.

00:11:56.524 --> 00:12:00.570
The standard gets very practical.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.601
It differentiates between types of images.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.370
A decorative image should be hidden
from a screen reader,

00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:18.511
while an informative one must have

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.631
descriptive alt text

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.561
that conveys the same meaning.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.430
The structure continues logical.

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:31.681
Headings.

00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:35.161
Ensure your content

00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:41.071
has a clear hierarchy,
like a table of contents,

00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:42.701
or,

00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:46.132
for instance, 5.4, regions,

00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:49.860
define the main areas of a page,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.620
like a header, main content, and footer.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.240
Links and navigation.

00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.471
Links and navigation,

00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:09.391
make sure links are clear and predictable.

00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:14.179
5.9, forms,

00:13:14.478 --> 00:13:18.510
and that input are crucial, with rules

00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:24.424
for clear labels and error message,
so everyone can submit information

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:25.604
successfully.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.513
5.11, use of colors.

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:38.881
It goes beyond aesthetics,
requiring sufficient color contrast,

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:44.070
so text is readable
for users with low vision.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.740
It covers much more,
from multimedia to animations.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.231
The beauty of this structure

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.881
is that it turns
the vast concept of accessibility

00:13:57.481 --> 00:14:00.480
into manageable, testable chunks.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.030
Each section

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.517
gives us

00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:11.040
a specific area to focus
and validate in WordPress projects.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.471
This organized approach
is exactly what we've translated

00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:20.190
into our practical checklist.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.561
Before we dive into specific rules,
let me show

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.171
the checklist.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.331
This is the checklist we have in Brazil.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:41.340
They translated it to English,
and we have these items here.

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:45.060
We have keyboard interaction, images,

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:46.451
header.

00:14:46.981 --> 00:14:49.770
This is how this checklist

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.340
is divided.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:00.900
For each item, we have
several tasks we need to do.

00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.201
For instance, this is a requirement.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.780
Visible focus indicator.

00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:12.991
All elements have visible focus indicator,
so we should answer,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800
yes, no.

00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:17.481
We need to answer this.

00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:20.190
Recommendations,

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.221
we shouldn't look.

00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:25.530
Only requirements.

00:15:26.341 --> 00:15:32.219
Most of the recommendations,
they take AAA.

00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:33.810
That is not

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:35.370
our focus here.

00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:43.950
We can test going through each element
that is a requirement and answer,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.220
yes, no,

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.493
or N/A.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.970
This is how it looks,

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:52.079
the checklist.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.880
Of course, we can do some comments

00:15:54.571 --> 00:15:55.571
as well.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.091
Let me talk about this.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.950
Each item is clearly marked.

00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:08.851
The most important ones
are the requirements.

00:16:09.438 --> 00:16:13.141
These are the essential rules
you must follow.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.821
If you don't,

00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:20.221
your site will have barriers
that prevent people from using it.

00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:24.907
Then, we have recommendation.

00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:30.481
They make the experience
much better for users,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.060
but they are not mandatory

00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:35.881
for basic accessibility.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:43.621
Then, as the next step to create
an excellent inclusive website,

00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:46.230
when you are testing,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.721
for each item,

00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:52.171
you will check one of these options,

00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:53.861
meets.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.591
This means that item
fully follows the rule.

00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:01.831
Everything is working correctly.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.931
Does not meet.

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:05.970
This means

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.648
that there is a problem
here that needs to be fixed.

00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:13.560
Not applicable.

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:19.890
This means the item doesn't apply
to the page or component

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.954
that we are testing.

00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:25.355
Finally,

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.961
there is a comment field.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.001
This is where you can write
notes, explain situations,

00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:37.231
or paste a link to the code
that needs to be fixed.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.051
It's very useful for your team
to understand what to do.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.661
This infrastructure requirement
recommendation, meets,

00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.455
does not meet,

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:54.927
and comments is what makes
your checklist powerful

00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:59.307
and actionable too.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.711
Now, let's see the structure and look

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.311
at the first
and most important set of rules.

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:08.221
Keyboard interaction.

00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:13.621
Now let's talk about keyboard navigation.

00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.490
I'm going to talk only
about the requirements.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.435
Let's talk about 5.1.1.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.700
Visible focus indicator.

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:25.801
This is something crucial.

00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:27.221
When you press

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.901
the tab to move it through a website,

00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:35.131
you need to see a clear highlight
around the link,

00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:40.771
button, or form field you are on.

00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.971
This highlight is called
a focus indicator.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.590
It's a little light that shows.

00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:51.391
When you are without it,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.671
keyboard users are lost.

00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.440
The rule is simple.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.140
Every clickable thing
must show this highlight

00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.821
when you tab on it.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.057
Let's move to 5.1.4.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.311
Predictable focus order.

00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:16.171
When you press tab, the focus should move

00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:18.391
in a logical order.

00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:23.011
It should go from top
to bottom and left to right,

00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:25.380
just like reading a book.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.380
It should jump
around the page--

00:19:30.122 --> 00:19:35.341
It shouldn't, sorry, it shouldn't jump
around the page randomly.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.920
If you are filling out a form,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.151
the focus should go
from the first name field

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.540
to the last name,

00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:48.181
to the email, in a predictable sequence.

00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:53.500
This makes the website easy to understand

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.340
and to use.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.760
Another very important rule.

00:19:57.761 --> 00:20:00.676
Let's talk about 5.1.6.

00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:02.470
Focus trap.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.660
A user should never,

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:06.641
ever get stuck.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.430
They must always be able to tab

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.951
into a part of the page

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.530
and just

00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:18.130
as importantly, tab out of it.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:22.119
A common place
where this happens is inside

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.761
a pop-up window or a menu, for instance.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.321
If you can't escape it using the keyboard,

00:20:29.951 --> 00:20:31.390
that's a keyboard trap,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.721
and it makes the website
completely unusable.

00:20:38.351 --> 00:20:43.511
Now, let's talk about pop-ups that appear

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.740
when you tab to a button

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
or link.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.737
We are talking about 5.1.8.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.291
Persistent and additional content.

00:20:56.479 --> 00:21:01.923
It says that if a pop-up appears
because of keyboard focus,

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:03.580
it must stay visible.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.650
It can't just disappear

00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:07.571
after a few seconds.

00:21:08.538 --> 00:21:14.800
It has to stay until the user
intentionally moves away or closes it.

00:21:16.955 --> 00:21:20.144
How do they close it?

00:21:21.151 --> 00:21:25.632
That's covered by 5.1.9.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.889
Dismissable additional content.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.290
There must be an easy way
to close that pop-up

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.410
without having to move

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.959
the keyboard focus.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.331
The skip key

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.190
is that standard way to do this.

00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:53.410
This gives the user full control
of the content.

00:21:54.641 --> 00:22:03.341
Finally, for keyboard shortcuts,
5.1.11, this one,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.880
is a key rule.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.011
If website uses a singular shortcut,

00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:15.881
like press S to search,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:23.701
it can cause problems for people
who use speech recognition software,

00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:26.980
because when they say S,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.511
it might trigger the shortcut
instead of typing the letter.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.761
The rule says that if you have
a single key shortcut,

00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:43.000
you must let users turn it off,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.990
change it,

00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:50.425
or make it only work
when a specific part of the page

00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:51.945
is selected.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.181
Just do recap.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.719
The key requirements
for keyboard are clear,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.320
visible focus so you know where you are,

00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:09.011
a logical tab order that makes sense,

00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:13.060
no traps where you can get stuck,

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:20.470
controllable pop-ups that stay open
and can be closed with the Escape key.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.060
Shortcuts that don't cause
accidental actions.

00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:36.911
These are the functional rules that make
a website navigable for everyone

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240
who relies

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.880
on a keyboard.

00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:42.591
Now,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.841
let's talk about

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.370
one of the most common elements
on any website.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.140
Let's talk about images.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.030
They make a site beautiful
and help explain things,

00:23:55.031 --> 00:24:01.570
but for users who are blind
or have low vision,

00:24:01.991 --> 00:24:06.521
that information is completely lost
if we don't describe it.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.280
That's where these rules come in.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.941
All of these are requirements,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.370
meaning they are essential.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.865
Let's go to 5.2.1.

00:24:23.104 --> 00:24:26.890
Alternative text for content images.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.931
This is the most basic rule.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.280
If an image covers
important information like a graphic,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.710
a photo of a product, or an infographic,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.960
it must have

00:24:41.651 --> 00:24:43.481
a text description

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.270
called alt text.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.240
This description is read
by screen readers,

00:24:52.661 --> 00:24:54.700
so everyone understands

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.790
what the image shows.

00:24:58.961 --> 00:24:59.980
Now, let's move

00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:03.182
to 5.2.2.

00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:07.353
Alternative text for functional images.

00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:16.601
If an image is used as a button or a link,
the alt text must describe the action,

00:25:17.231 --> 00:25:18.521
not the picture.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.930
For example,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.050
if a magnifying glass icon for search

00:25:27.011 --> 00:25:31.750
should have alt text say search,
not magnifying glass.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.971
This tells the user

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.330
what will happen if they click on it.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:49.382
Then, we have
the opposite situation with 5.2.3.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.471
Alternative text for decorative images.

00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:58.871
If an image is purely for decoration

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:07.271
and does not add any information,
like a stylistic border

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:12.739
on a background graphic,
it must be marked as decorative.

00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:20.650
We do this by giving it empty alt text.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.814
This tells the screen readers
to completely ignore it.

00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:32.380
Which helps users focus
on the important content.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.368
Now, jump for 5.4.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.861
Descriptions for complex images.

00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:48.490
Some images are too complicated
for a short alt text.

00:26:49.811 --> 00:26:52.300
A detailed chart, a map,

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:57.011
or a technical diagram
needs more explanation.

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:03.310
The rule here is that you must provide
a short description

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.680
in the alt text

00:27:06.281 --> 00:27:07.901
and then detailed,

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.060
longer description

00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:12.640
right next to the image

00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:16.660
or on a linked page.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.741
This ensures that complex information

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.291
is fully available to everyone.

00:27:25.181 --> 00:27:26.381
A very important rule.

00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:32.986
That is the next 5.2.5.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.691
Images of text.

00:27:35.711 --> 00:27:36.731
In general,

00:27:37.451 --> 00:27:40.420
you should never use an image of text.

00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:42.201
Why?

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.681
Because text

00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:49.120
in an image cannot be resized by the user.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.571
It often has poor contrast,

00:27:53.381 --> 00:27:55.571
and screen readers can't read it.

00:27:56.861 --> 00:28:00.251
If you absolutely must use
an image of text,

00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:02.470
like for a logo,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.271
the alt text must contain
the exactly same words

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:10.391
that are shown in the image.

00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:17.342
Finally, 5.2.6.

00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:20.770
Alternative text for image maps.

00:28:22.931 --> 00:28:24.851
If you have a single image

00:28:25.481 --> 00:28:32.231
with multiple clickable areas, each
of those clickable spots must have

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:38.050
its own alt text that describes
where that link will take you.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.150
To recap,

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.831
the key requirements for images
are describing informative images,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.720
name the action for functional images,

00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:59.080
hide decorative images,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:05.334
provide both short and long descriptions
for complex images,

00:29:06.071 --> 00:29:09.340
avoid using images of text.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:18.341
Label every clickable area
on an image map.

00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:21.740
By following these rules,

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.970
make sure that the visual information
on our site is available

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.861
to every single user.

00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:33.430
Now, let's talk
about something very simple,

00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:35.650
but very important.

00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:37.161
Lists.

00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:41.921
We use lists all the time on websites,

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.611
and when they are coded correctly,

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:53.170
they help everyone understand
and navigate content more easily.

00:29:55.092 --> 00:29:58.261
Both of these rules are requirements.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.900
First, 5.5.1.

00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:05.610
Lists semantics.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.530
This rule is about using the correct code.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:19.441
We can't just make a list by putting
a dash or a number in front of each item.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:24.481
For a screen reader
to understand it's a list,

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.526
we must use the proper HTML tags.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.381
If it's a bullet list,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.650
where the order

00:30:35.631 --> 00:30:36.631
doesn't matter,

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:44.971
we use the UL tag, under an ordered list.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.350
If it's a numbered list,

00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:53.100
where the sequence is important,

00:30:53.731 --> 00:31:01.651
we use the ordered list, the OL tag.

00:31:02.581 --> 00:31:10.510
If it's a list of terms and definitions,
we use the L tag definition list.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.051
Using the right tag

00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:18.811
is what programmatically determinate
semantics means.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:21.980
It tells the assistive technology,

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:30.930
"Hey, this is a group of related items,
which makes the content structure

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.580
much clearer."

00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:39.170
Next, 5.5.2.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.490
Use of lists.

00:31:42.451 --> 00:31:45.300
This rule is about using lists

00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:48.339
for their correct purpose.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:54.540
Lists should only be used
to group together items

00:31:55.171 --> 00:32:00.510
that are truly related
and of the same nature.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.230
For example,

00:32:03.211 --> 00:32:06.840
a list of ingredients in a recipe,

00:32:08.311 --> 00:32:12.630
the steps in a tutorial,
a navigation menu.

00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:20.010
You should not use lists
markup just to indent text

00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:22.711
for visual styling.

00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:29.250
If the items are not logically a group,
don't use a list.

00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:35.461
Using lists correctly ensures
that the information is presented

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:38.761
in a logical and predictable way.

00:32:41.161 --> 00:32:42.161
To recap,

00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:48.061
the key requirements for lists
are very straightforward.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.520
Use the correct code,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:56.341
UL, OL, or the L tags for your lists.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.281
Only use lists for grouping related items.

00:33:03.661 --> 00:33:08.610
By following these two simple rules,
you make sure that lists are

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:16.380
a helpful tool for organization
and not a source of confusion.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.181
To execute this checklist
efficiently and consistently,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:28.081
we don't have
to do it at all entirely by hand.

00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:30.690
We can use powerful tools

00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:35.281
to help us implement and verify
these rules much faster.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.219
Think of these tools not
as a replacement for the checklist,

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.360
but as your powerful assistants.

00:33:45.931 --> 00:33:48.780
They help you to spot technical issues

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.740
instantly, so you can focus
on expert judgment

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:59.580
on more complex usability problems.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.300
I want to show you two essential tools
that work hand-in-hand

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.184
with our manual review.

00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:09.701
First,

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680
WAVE tool.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.461
It gives you an immediate visual report
right on the page,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:21.567
highlighting errors
and structure elements.

00:34:21.991 --> 00:34:25.350
It's fantastic
for a quick visual overview,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.978
helping you quickly spot
and check manual items

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:31.830
from your checklist.

00:34:31.981 --> 00:34:33.391
Let me do a test here.

00:34:33.961 --> 00:34:35.551
Let me click on it.

00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:39.721
What does it bring to me?

00:34:40.582 --> 00:34:46.410
21 errors, 0 contrast errors,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.300
some alerts, features,
structure elements, and ARIA.

00:34:52.771 --> 00:34:55.770
Let's go and see those errors.

00:34:57.001 --> 00:35:01.140
There are five elements
that are missing label.

00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:05.940
Broken ARIA references.

00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:09.031
Let's see what else.

00:35:09.517 --> 00:35:11.040
This is the navigation order.

00:35:12.091 --> 00:35:15.060
It's important to see
structure navigation.

00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:19.456
It's important always
to check if there is an H1.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.631
Okay, it's also in the checklist.

00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:29.042
We must have at least one H1 in the page.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.790
Now, check
if the order of the other headers

00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:33.791
are correct.

00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:35.201
Contrast.

00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:37.560
If there is any problem

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280
here,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320
we can see it.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.620
Let me show my page.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.521
Let's run WAVE here.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.030
Now, we have seven errors here.

00:35:51.924 --> 00:35:52.924
Let's see.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.139
Missing alternative text.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.670
There are some images here

00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:00.031
that doesn't have alternative text.

00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:02.341
You see this one, for instance.

00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:07.020
We can also check the code of that image.

00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:15.631
If we want to take a detailed look on it,
we can disable styles.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.871
For inspection,

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.931
it's much better to see the code,
and to see the errors.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.971
For instance, I have an error here.

00:36:32.049 --> 00:36:33.511
Another error here.

00:36:37.352 --> 00:36:41.012
This is something that we must use.

00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:45.361
WAVE is a good tool to check for errors,

00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:49.111
always following the checklist.

00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:55.260
Checklist first, tools after.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.201
This is something that we can do.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.190
Another tool that I'd like to show you is

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.765
the tool from AMAWeb.

00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:12.900
Besides the
checklist

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.680
that we can find--

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.370
the checklist here,

00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:20.816
we also have the validator.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.581
This is the validator

00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:27.301
for AMAWeb.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.661
There are three different types of ways

00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:37.981
to push code, to validate a page here.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.600
First,

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.334
using the URL.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.050
Let me get my site, for instance.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.141
I'll get the URL from my site,

00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:53.791
then I'll paste here.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.261
Now, the tool is checking

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.956
my code, the web code.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.341
There is a score here.

00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:17.640
Let me translate this,
so everybody can follow it.

00:38:20.181 --> 00:38:21.240
There's a score.

00:38:25.071 --> 00:38:31.081
The items that passed the test,
some items to review manually.

00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.530
It doesn't mean that they are wrong.

00:38:34.551 --> 00:38:38.402
It means that we need
to check it manually.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.130
One not acceptable.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.421
Here, I found seven images
on the page that do not have

00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:51.750
the necessary alternative text equivalent.

00:38:52.171 --> 00:38:57.361
There are the images that we saw before,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.690
that doesn't have an alternative text.

00:39:04.471 --> 00:39:10.561
I found one image on the page
where it has more than 100 characters.

00:39:11.499 --> 00:39:14.131
Things that we need to check manually.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.580
There is another way to check.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.980
Let me come back.

00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:25.891
That is by inserting HTML code.

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:34.904
By inserting HTML code,
you need to get the code here,

00:39:42.406 --> 00:39:43.406
and paste here.

00:39:48.229 --> 00:39:51.129
It will do the same process.

00:39:57.776 --> 00:40:02.921
There are some differences in the code
from the handled one and the one

00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:05.240
that it gets through the URL.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440
The score

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.510
is less.

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.361
The process is the same.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.900
Finally,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:25.781
I'd like to show you a tool that can help

00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:35.095
users with assistive technology.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.711
There are several tools in the marketing.

00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:44.740
I'm going to talk about this one
because I work with this one,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.400
but in the marketing, there are
several tools that work

00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:53.110
as assistive technologies.

00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:55.781
This tool,

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:08.050
it helps people
with several challenges, to navigate.

00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.691
We have a screen reader.

00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:19.791
Once I turn on it, it gets the page read
for screen readers.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:23.560
You see that some content in my page

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.220
has changed.

00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:27.641
It causes it.

00:41:28.231 --> 00:41:29.441
This is the effect.

00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:36.386
We have a clear focus on the elements.

00:41:36.906 --> 00:41:40.810
It turns easy the navigation

00:41:41.561 --> 00:41:42.561
with keyboard.

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:49.611
Checklist,

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:56.410
to finalize here,
I'd say use the checklist.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:05.506
It will really help you understand
and go through accessibility to turn

00:42:05.507 --> 00:42:07.840
the site accessible.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.480
The second part,

00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:11.481
I'd say,

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.530
use

00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:15.370
those tools,

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.721
such as WAVE, AMAWeb,

00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:23.740
or whatever tool that does
this kind of validation.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480
That's it.

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:30.809
Thank you so much

00:42:32.201 --> 00:42:33.940
for the time.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.149
Alicia St. Rose: Wow,
thank you, Rodrigo.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.349
Thank you so much for that.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:47.150
I really appreciate
that even in another language,

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:53.059
it's really momentous and ambitious
to go through that WCAG.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.819
[laughs]

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.940
Thank you.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:43:01.047
If anyone actually has questions,
you can put them in the Q&A.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.405
We'd rather have you do it there

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.499
and not in the chat.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.579
I actually had a question or two

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.629
while you were going through this.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.489
One of them, because I did notice

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.360
in the first example,
it was in Portuguese.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.830
I'm wondering
what are some of the challenges,

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:26.509
because I mainly
am focused on English.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.039
I never even think
about another language

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.529
when I'm working with accessibility.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.299
What are the challenges
having a language

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.940
that's not actually
the lingua franca or whatever?

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.343
Are there things you have to consider
with accessibility?

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.299
Rodrigo Ibraim Teixeira: Yes.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.940
Actually, here in Brazil,

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.730
we have so many foreign words.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.309
Some of those words
are already familiar

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:03.140
to us in Brazil,
like sales, like off,

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.290
but when we talk
about screen readers,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.990
it's important to understand
in what language is that word,

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.699
that foreign word.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:25.010
For the screen readers,
read it with the right accent.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:31.009
It's one challenge here
in Brazil when we have some parts

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:35.570
of the text in a foreign language,
for instance, English.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.357
we need to also,

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:44.000
there's some rules
that we need to follow on WCAG

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.310
that can make it happen.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:57.170
Like mark as a tag for English word,
for instance, in that place,

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:01.849
and the screen reader
will read it with the right accent.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.329
This is one of the challenges.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.839
Alicia: Then another question, let me
look in the Q&A, we have something.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.121
I'm going to go back and forth.

00:45:13.122 --> 00:45:14.099
I have another question,

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.559
but we're going to get
to the actual Q&A.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.919
What's something you would recommend

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.125
to someone beginning
in accessibility, where to start?

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.859
Rodrigo: I think
the most important thing

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:35.541
to understand in accessibility,
talking about accessibility,

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.679
is to understand the challenges,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.933
the different challenges
that people have.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.210
It's really nice--

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.849
for instance,
we have lots of rules in WCAG,

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:58.100
but no one is better to say that rule

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.000
works or not with someone
with some disability.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.090
What is the best contrast,
for instance,

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.574
in a text in the background?

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:16.520
Actually, the rule gives us
just an idea what should it be,

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:22.940
but the best person
to know what is the best one

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.740
is someone that
has difficulty to see it.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.875
We need to think
not only on the rules,

00:46:34.406 --> 00:46:40.490
we need to live accessibility,
not only just study accessibility.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.213
Understand the rules
are really important,

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.900
but live accessibility
is more important.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:57.260
[crosstalk]

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:03.680
For instance, like an image, the rule
says that an alternative text

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:07.970
should have at least 100 characters,
for instance.

00:47:12.154 --> 00:47:18.860
It's not okay to say
that a specific test is good or not.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:20.990
You need to feel it.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:26.492
You need to have the feeling
that it is a good text or not.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.860
Alicia: I get you.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.179
We have another question,

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.658
and that last question
was from Emilio.

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:35.674
We have one from an anonymous
attendee.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.989
They want to know
is there a way to show Google

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:42.230
that your website
is accessibility ready.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.112
That's an interesting question.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:53.120
Rodrigo: Talking about
a good position

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.970
on the search, right,
because Google validates that.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.680
Make sure that meta tags are okay.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:12.960
Alternative text,
if there is semantic on your code.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:20.140
If you want to place a list of items,

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.270
use the semantic elements.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.178
make sure that

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.900
there is not semantic elements,

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:36.470
like third-party components,
for instance.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.619
I know this is a big
challenge on WordPress,

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:45.350
but make sure
that those components are semantic.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.094
I think this is
the most important thing.

00:48:50.513 --> 00:48:53.099
Alicia: We have about two minutes,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.099
and Amy has asked
a really cool question,

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.189
because I was actually
curious about this, too.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.889
She says, I don't know
if this fits the work you do,

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:02.359
but would you like to comment

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.169
about the accessibility testing
report package you deliver

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:09.820
with all test results,
and what do you include?

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.399
Rodrigo: Sorry, [crosstalk]

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.769
Alicia: What she's asking is,

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.790
when you have all your testing done,

00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:23.359
how do you package
up all those results,

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.882
and what do you include
when you're giving it to a client?

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:33.800
Rodrigo: Actually, for myself,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:39.590
I used to collect all possible
evidence, like screenshots.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.899
Also, that report that I showed,

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.170
we can save it into a PDF.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.480
It will be all items,

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.300
all required items will be saved
in a PDF with comments.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:06.560
I also use it to pack
some images for reference.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.099
Alicia: Oh, wow.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:09.739
That's awesome.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.467
It's like an accessibility Figma.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.700
All right.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:19.270
I believe that was the last question,
and we have to--

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.789
I want to thank you,
actually, Rodrigo,

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.480
for a really extensive presentation.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.476
