>> JEREMY RIVERA: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
My name is Jeremy Rivera and I'm
a developer advocate from Deque Systems.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.101
Thank you for joining us
for The Art of Accessibility:

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.524
Making Documents Delightfully Inclusive
with Samantha Merrett.

00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.681
Samantha Merrett is
a senior accessibility specialist

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.461
at the UK Ministry of Justice
with a strong background

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.011
in digital accessibility
across the public sector.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.650
Certified in core competencies
and the accessible documents specialist

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.980
by the International Association
of Accessibility Professionals,

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.450
and a career spanning roles
in various UK government departments,

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:17.011
Samantha has led initiatives to improve
the accessibility of digital content,

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.321
services, and communications.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.470
Her work includes remediating
complex documents and delivering training

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.560
on creative inclusion documents
and presentations.

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:33.420
She is also a passionate advocate
for embedding accessibility

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.530
from the outset,

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.830
and she has contributed
to community events

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.250
such as the UK Cross-Government
Accessibility Quarterly

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.141
and is a frequent speaker on topics
ranging from hosting accessible events

00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:48.481

Please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&A section

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.870
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.181
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:03.541
>> SAMANTHA MERRETT: Thank you so much
for choosing to join my session.

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.054
This session is called
The Art of Accessibility:

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.460
Making Documents Delightfully Inclusive.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.091
My aim today is that you'll leave
the session feeling like you know

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.371
a little bit more
about document accessibility

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.521
and how you can make sure
what you're creating is accessible

00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.140
for the majority of your users.

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:25.110
The agenda for the session today,
I always like to start

00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:26.661
off with a little bit about me.

00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.421
I always think it's nice when you join
a session like this that you get to know

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.850
a little bit about the presenter
rather than diving straight

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.760
into the content first of all.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:38.310
We're then going to talk about choosing
the right document format,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.389
what that looks like,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.181
and why you might choose
one format choice over another.

00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:47.191
I'll then take you through some top tips
for creating wonderful Word documents

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.211
that are accessible.

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:51.431
We'll then move to look
at polished presentations

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.230
and consider how we can try
to create accessible presentations,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.490
and then we'll finish with a look
at Excel spreadsheets and spreadsheets

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.078
in general, thinking about how we can make
those excellent and accessible

00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:04.496
for our user base.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.690
I'll also include a disclaimer now
that I do love dogs and I love an animal,

00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:11.254
so throughout the presentation,

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:13.470
there are somewhat topical pictures
of dogs

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:16.861
which I will audio-describe
so all of us can enjoy them together,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.067
but I wanted to forewarn you
of that as we move

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:20.367
through this presentation.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.400
As I said, I always think it's nice
that you guys get to know me a little bit

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.850
before I spend the next 40 minutes
or so with you.

00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:30.420
Who am I?

00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:32.361
Well my name is Samantha Merrett.

00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:36.509
I'm a senior accessibility specialist
and I work in the Ministry of Justice

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.510
in the UK.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.056
I work
in part of the Digital Accessibility Team.

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:45.719
One of my main roles and responsibilities
within that team is to build

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.091
accessibility skills
across the organization,

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:51.330
so I do a lot of online
and hands-on training to try

00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.781
and build up that capability.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.801
My pronouns are she/her.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.552
I'm a young woman in her 20s.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.749
I have blonde hair which is
in a ponytail today and I'm wearing

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:01.800
a pair of glasses.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.681
I always like to share a little bit more
about myself to go

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:10.341
just beyond the professional
just so you can really get to know me

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:11.641
and who I am as a person.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.409
I've got four different pictures
on the slide that describe and attempt

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.580
to sum me up really.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.820
Starting from the far left,
we have my dog,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.241
Bella.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.350
My dog Bella is--

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.349
she's the light of my life

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.500
and she really does make me smile
every day.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.821
She's a grey Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:34.050
The picture is her lying on our sofa
fast asleep and really sums up

00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.151
what she does on pretty much
a daily basis.

00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:40.469
Moving across to the slide
on the bottom of my slide,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.619
I've got
pictures of different travel items.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.561
I've got a passport, a sun hat, a camera.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.841
This is representing my love for travel.

00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:52.320
I love to go all over the world
and experience different people,

00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:55.983
different cultures and really immerse
myself in other people's worlds.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.950
It's a big part of what I like to do away
from work.

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.710
In the top of my slide,

00:06:01.951 --> 00:06:04.041
I've got a picture
of myself and my fiancĂ©,

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:05.041
Liam.

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:07.739
One of our happy places is Disneyland.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.231
We like to go there quite a bit,
it's a really nice place for us

00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:11.231
to connect.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.830
Again, that picture is us standing
in front of the Disneyland castle.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.921
Finally, I have a picture of a lady
doing some yoga on a sunset or a sunrise.

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:22.920
Again, yoga is a big part of my life.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.219
It really helps me disconnect
from everything else and just focus

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.820
on the mind and body
for a very short period of time.

00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:31.442
That's a little bit
about me, and hopefully,

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:35.042
it gives you a flavor of who I am
and where I'm coming to you from today.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.170
Let's not waste any more time
because we don't have much time together,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.570
so let's focus on document accessibility.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.081
As I said in my agenda,
we're going to start

00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:48.330
with choosing the right document format
and we're going to think

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.430
about how that's really, really important.

00:06:51.271 --> 00:06:53.191
A lot of people question
when I do training

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:57.241
on document accessibility why I put
in about format choice at the start.

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:01.410
For me, format actually
has a really big impact

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:04.199
on the final accessible output
because you could create

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.130
a fully accessible document
and then you could export it or convert it

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:10.051
to something that's inaccessible,

00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:12.300
and so it's really,
really important that we think

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.650
about that and that we're choosing
the right format from the outset.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.701
What's the point in talking
about creating these accessible documents

00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.801
if we don't actually define what they are?

00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:27.091
On this slide, we've got
our first dog picture other

00:07:27.096 --> 00:07:28.371
than my beautiful Bella.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.239
The picture is of a pug sitting down
with its head tilted to one side

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.460
in front of a blackboard
with lots of question marks all over it.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.380
I put that one in there
because it looks like the pug's asking me

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.930
for an answer to this question.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.429
If I was asked to define what is
an accessible document I would say,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.910
"An accessible document allows
as many people as possible to access

00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:51.911
that information."

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.041
If you've ever tried to make
a document accessible it might feel

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:58.620
a little bit tedious,
it might feel a little bit overwhelming,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.570
there might be quite a lot to consider,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.770
but I always tell those
that I work with and I train

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.931
that creating accessible documents
is so important

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.200
and it's really crucial
that we think about it every step.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.770
At the end of the day, why are we creating
something if we don't want it to be read

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.170
and understood by everybody?

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:21.961
You've probably joined the session today
because you think document accessibility

00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:25.262
is important and I welcome you
into that session with that mindset,

00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:27.451
but just in case you are wondering,

00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:28.701
"Why is it so important?"

00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:32.549
Well, it ensures that everyone has
the same opportunity to access

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.691
the same information.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.881
That one sits top of my list.

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.450
It's the reason why I do what I do
and the reason why I like to talk

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:40.901
about it as much as possible.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.318
It is rumored as well
to be part of the WCAG,

00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:48.810
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
in the 3.0 version that's currently

00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:49.811
in progress.

00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:53.460
If that does eventually become
a major part of the guidelines then

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.360
by learning about it now and making
sure we're building in that progress now,

00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.630
hopefully we'll be in better state
if and when that does appear

00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:01.631
in the guidelines.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.330
It's also the law.

00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.781
I work in a public sector organization.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.231
For us, it's really important
that we are producing accessible documents

00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:13.201
in the UK, so for us we
also have that to consider.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.571
However that always sits
at the bottom of my list

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.971
because that's not how I want
to motivate people to do accessibility.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.440
I want them to do it because they care

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.295
and because they know
it's a good thing to do

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.848
and it benefits a lot more people
than just a small user group.

00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:28.740
For me, that's why we do
document accessibility.

00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:33.441
Choosing the right format then.

00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:34.619
How do I do that?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.190
Because as I've said,
it is really important

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.340
that we think about it.

00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:40.350
There's lots of different choices
when it comes to documents.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.411
You could create a spreadsheet,
you could do a traditional document.

00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.960
It could be a presentation,
it could be a PDF.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.430
When people ask me,
I never know which one to choose.

00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:51.872
There's a lot out there.

00:09:51.872 --> 00:09:55.591
We always get asked for the same version
but is there a better way of doing it?

00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.300
I always take it back to basics.

00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.850
Just ask
yourself three different questions.

00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.351
Who's going to use the document?

00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:04.541
How are they going to use it?

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.011
How are you going to share it with them?

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:10.620
The answer to those three questions
often helps you determine

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:12.601
what document format type is best.

00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:14.431
For example,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.150
if people are going to use

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.330
the document to calculate budgets
or work out their financial spend

00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:21.981
for the month,

00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:24.141
a spreadsheet probably
works well for that,

00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.281
especially if you're going
to share it over an email

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:28.590
and you're not necessarily going
to publish it anywhere,

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.740
it's more just
for your document team files.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.701
Again, if you're going to present
information to people in a meeting,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.770
it's a board meeting,
maybe a presentation works,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.070
you want something
on the screen that's visual.

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.860
The answer to those questions
will always vary but it's really important

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.500
that you consider those answers carefully
because that could help you think

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.050
about what format type is best.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.401
Let's kick off with the first one
which is PowerPoint

00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.961
or presentation format, whatever it is
that you tend to use in your organization.

00:10:58.821 --> 00:11:02.730
I've got a picture of a dog on this slide
with one eye very close to the camera

00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:05.581
and the words, "I have my eye on you,"
written at the top.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.370
The reason the dog
is looking quite intense is

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.091
because I would say PowerPoint is
one of the most misused format types.

00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:16.980
PowerPoint should primarily be used
for visual presentations that tell

00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:17.981
a story.

00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:23.670
They should be used for presentations
only and they are very much a visual tool,

00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:25.560
but the presenter is the main focus.

00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:27.241
They're there as a backup,

00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:30.960
as a resource after the session
maybe to give extra information.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.611
What they shouldn't be used
for is projects or reports.

00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:40.290
We do see this a lot within our space
and the space that I work in.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.070
Often they are produced in PowerPoint
but they're actually long reports

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.071
that really would be better off in Word.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.110
Unless you're going to present
that information then maybe

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.511
a presentation format
is not the best choice.

00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:56.371
On the other hand,
if you're thinking about spreadsheets,

00:11:56.371 --> 00:11:58.621
and again, I'm using Excel
as an example here,

00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:04.651
Excel should be used to store,
analyze, report on large amounts of data.

00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:10.261
You might want to use it for budget sheets
or balance books or attendance reports,

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:14.550
but we don't tend to try and use Excel
for writing lots of text.

00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:17.429
Project management spreadsheets
are not ideal,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.080
and forms don't really work very well
in Excel either.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.390
Then we come to documents,

00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:27.030
the big one, the one
that covers a lot of stuff.

00:12:27.961 --> 00:12:30.211
In this case again,
I'm using Word as an example,

00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:32.430
but you could think of any
kind of software that you use,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.321
it would be the same type premise.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.301
What we tend to say in our organization
is if it's made in Word,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.531
it can stay in Word.

00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:44.459
There are very few instances where
converting that Word document

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.199
into another file format is beneficial,
so it's always better to keep it in Word

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.550
if you've created it there.

00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:54.131
If you're in doubt
about what document format

00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:57.462
to use then maybe opt for Word
because 9 times out of 10,

00:12:57.781 --> 00:12:59.881
it's going to be the most suitable format.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.680
Why is it good?

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.210
Why is a document the best thing?

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.260
Well, documents tend to be more flexible.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.910
They work well if you do need
to convert them to something like a PDF,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.910
for example,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.349
and they tend
to be more compatible and useful

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.650
with assistive technology.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.209
It's not to say you can't use
any kind of assistive tech

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.960
with the other file formats,
because you absolutely can,

00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:24.361
but Word documents tend
to be more intuitive and much easier

00:13:24.361 --> 00:13:27.361
to navigate because they are more simple
in their design.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.320
Are there other options?

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.781
Of course, there are depending
on the context,

00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:36.030
what you're doing,
and what you're working on.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.531
You might be sending an email.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.261
Just think, "Do I need
to attach a document to this,

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:42.461
or could I just put it
in the email instead?"

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.410
Of course, I totally acknowledge
there are times when attaching a document

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.410
is sensible,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.820
makes sense, and it works,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.410
but just consider whether it really
is needed of what you're doing.

00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:56.460
Instead of publishing documents
on websites could you just paste them

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.480
onto a web page?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.021
Consider whether you really do need
documents in that scenario

00:14:01.021 --> 00:14:04.321
or whether you could create more
what we call HTML content instead.

00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:09.180
Then we come to PDFs.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.511
Now, this very much is
a UK government stance on the subject

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.050
and it might differ depending
on where you work and what you do.

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:19.391
If I get asked the question,
"Should I create a PDF with that?"

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.752
My answer
pretty much most of the time is no.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.050
I've got another dog meme on this slide.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.769
I've got a puppy with his paw held
up to the camera and the words read,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.720
"How about no," written across the top.

00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:34.231
That sums up pretty well
how we advise teams

00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:38.456
to approach PDF accessibility
and PDFs in general.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.827
We had a testimonial from
one of our assistive technology users

00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:46.050
that we work with and they said,
"I always open a PDF with trepidation

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.940
because more than half the time,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.070
trying to read one
with my assistive technology is

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.540
a frustrating experience."

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.510
I think
that's quite common feeling among those

00:14:57.511 --> 00:15:01.200
who do use assistive technology,
that PDFs often aren't checked

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.600
for accessibility
or aren't made accessible,

00:15:03.871 --> 00:15:06.541
which can create real problems for them
when they're trying to access

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:07.541
that information.

00:15:10.051 --> 00:15:11.850
Why are they so problematic?

00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:15.299
Again, I've got another dog on this slide.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.371
He doesn't look very happy.
It's a bulldog.

00:15:17.371 --> 00:15:19.920
His chin's on the floor
and the words read,

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:21.691
"Oh, look another PDF file."

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:23.819
Sums up how I feel.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.551
There was a time
when within the UK government there was

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.169
quite a churn of PDF files.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.620
It was the way we did things.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.640
They're not ideal
because they're not really designed

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.364
to be that flexible.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.865
That wasn't their intention
when they were created.

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:39.571
Often to read them,
they can be quite long.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.280
There would be quite
a lot of information in them,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.763
and they're just not very
adaptable and flexible

00:15:43.813 --> 00:15:45.030
to meet user needs.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.959
Of course, on the contrast,
if you're going to create

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.690
something like a Word document,
it includes all of that and more,

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.240
which again, is one of the reasons
why we tend to advise people

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.411
just to keep it simple
and keep to what you know.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.731
Now we know what format types there are
and choices are out there.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.111
Let's consider wonderful Word documents
or documents in general,

00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:12.791
and talk about some of the main things
to think about.

00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:14.741
Just to flag before I start,

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:16.935
a lot of the advice you
will have already noticed

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.335
I'm giving today is
based on the Microsoft Suite,

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:23.021
but the tips I'm providing
you can be applied regardless

00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:25.171
of the type of software
you might be using.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.351
Don't be put off if you think
it's all about Microsoft.

00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:30.570
A lot of the things
refer back to their tools

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.420
because that's what we use
in our organization,

00:16:33.811 --> 00:16:35.505
but that doesn't necessarily mean
you can't apply

00:16:35.505 --> 00:16:37.055
the same methodology elsewhere.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.121
I'm going in thick
and fast and I'm starting

00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:43.590
off with document headings.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.590
There is no way I could talk
about accessible documents

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.330
without addressing headings.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.271
Headings are the backbone of any document.

00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:55.262
A user should be able to scan a document
using just the headings and get

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:57.812
a really good overview
of what you're talking about.

00:16:58.863 --> 00:17:01.141
Headings give that information structure.

00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:06.030
They split it into different sections
and they really do help sighted and AT,

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:08.641
assisted technology,
users access that content.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.260
You've got to make sure
your headings are descriptive

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.820
and make sure they are
understandable on their own.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.490
Let your heading text tell the story
about the contents of that next paragraph

00:17:20.521 --> 00:17:21.521
or the page.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.221
As I've said, screen reader users
might use headings to navigate

00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:28.710
the document. In fact,
it's probably more than likely

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.710
that they will,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.241
because this means they can select
any part of the document that they want

00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:35.291
to read more about and go straight there.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.040
It's not just screen reader users
that will use it.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.550
Voice recognition software users
might also use voice commands,

00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:44.850
but at the end of the day,
all readers will benefit

00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:49.351
from a really well-structured document
that can be navigated quite easily.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.880
Things to think
about when you're adding headings.

00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:59.820
Making it bold and making it size 28
does not make it a heading.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.319
You must use the styles that any software,
but in this case we're talking

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.261
about Word, provides
to make sure they are accessible.

00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:12.089
It's just a word of warning as well
that the styled headings in Word

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.390
are not necessarily accessible
from the outset.

00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:18.116
They might often use a really thin font
or a light blue font.

00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:22.110
Just make sure you modify them to suit
your own needs and make sure

00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.361
they're accessible
with your branding as well.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.151
The other thing to flag is
the title style.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.973
We tend not to use
the title style in Word.

00:18:30.023 --> 00:18:32.373
We tend to use "Heading 1"
as our first heading.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.950
The title style
doesn't really do much for us.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.451
If we want headings in a sequential order
we should always start with one,

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.430
and then we have only
one of those per document most of the time

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.430
and work from there.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.560
Moving on from headings,
because I hope now I've convinced you

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.709
that they are really, really important,
we're going to talk

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.091
about accessible tables.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.420
Again, this is really, really important.

00:18:57.661 --> 00:18:59.791
I love a table when used correctly.

00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:01.440
Tables are really great.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:05.734
They're a useful tool for organizing data,
making comparisons

00:19:05.735 --> 00:19:10.046
between data sets
and being able to see things at a glance

00:19:10.086 --> 00:19:11.086
and compare them.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.209
However, to make
a table accessible you do need to ensure

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.640
that you think about quite
a few different things.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.969
Once you've used and embedded
these you are on your way to creating

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.201
a nice accessible table.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.529
One thing I would say
before I start is please do not add tables

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.090
as images into your document.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.680
Please don't screenshot a table
and paste it into a document as an image.

00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:38.191
It renders that information
completely inaccessible,

00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:43.487
and even if you were able to create
some alternative text to describe

00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:45.930
what that image shows,
I doubt it would cover

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.050
the full breadth
and depth of that information in detail.

00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:54.509
With that aside, if you're creating
a table in your document make sure it has

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.710
a header row.

00:19:56.011 --> 00:20:00.749
Don't let your rows break across pages,
so don't let rows start on one page

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.150
and then finish on the next.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.410
Make sure rows stay together on each page.

00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.301
I've said identify a header row,
and most of the time that works,

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.090
but you might want to add a column
or you might want a row and a column.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.740
There's no, necessarily, right or wrong
with that as long as it makes sense

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.840
in the context in which you're working on.

00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:22.921
Please don't split or merge
cells in your table.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.400
Keep things nice and regular.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.230
Keep the structure in a way
that makes logical sense.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.971
Make sure you add a title for your table
so people know what the table is about

00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:33.771
and what the information relates to,

00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:38.221
and also consider whether you need
to add alternative text to your table,

00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:40.710
so text to describe what the table shows.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.620
This isn't always necessary
but it's a really nice add-on

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.660
if your table is a little bit complex
or you think a user might just benefit

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.410
from a little bit of extra information
about that table.

00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:55.140
If you're not familiar with adding
alternative text to table,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.350
it is under the properties
tab in most software.

00:20:58.753 --> 00:21:02.039
Also just think of it like writing
alternative text for an image.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.477
It follows a very similar pattern,
but you're just writing it

00:21:04.477 --> 00:21:05.641
for a table instead.

00:21:07.327 --> 00:21:11.040
One final check you can do on tables
is check that you can tab through them

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.041
in a logical order.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.210
Just make sure you start
from the top row and work your way down,

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.690
and make sure it makes sense
to you and then to your user.

00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:24.870
I have already mentioned
the tables properties box,

00:21:24.874 --> 00:21:29.701
but if you were to right-click or choose
that option for your table you can add

00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:33.061
your title or text and set
your header row in that box as well.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.030
As we've said, never paste
an image of a table in.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.970
It will prevent screen readers
from accessing that information

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.802
and it's really not best practice.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.775
Enough of the negative though,

00:21:44.775 --> 00:21:47.430
let's go back to another topic,
which in this case is,

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.200
are headers and footers accessible?

00:21:50.251 --> 00:21:52.200
Now, I have another dog meme for you.

00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:54.751
Come on. It's been a while
since I've shown you one.

00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:58.231
It's time we've got a golden lab
who looks like they're smiling

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.470
at the camera
with their tongue hanging out

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.350
and the speech bubble reads, "No."

00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:06.311
The question he's answering is,
are headers and footers accessible?

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.150
Page headers and footers
are not automatically read

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.550
by screen readers under recent testing.

00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:16.051
If you want the information in that header
or footer to be conveyed to the reader

00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:17.611
or the user,

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.890
then you need to include it
in the main body copy of your content.

00:22:22.081 --> 00:22:25.529
Page numbers are fine to use
because that information

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.060
is often shown elsewhere,

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.750
but we often see people put
version numbers or dates

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.050
in the header and footer,

00:22:32.104 --> 00:22:33.934
and that does mean that
other users might not be able

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:35.610
to access or read that content.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.900
Adding spacing.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.630
Adding spacing in any document
is interesting and can be done

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.710
in various ways,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.670
but there are a few simple things
to remember to make sure it remains

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.670
accessible.

00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:52.454
Don't use the Enter key
on your keyboard to add space

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.450
or start content on a new page.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.581
Use page breaks instead.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.020
Use tabs instead of spaces
if you really do need to separate text,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.129
and use the line spacing options
to create space between subjects

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.330
or objects on the page.

00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:11.910
If you're using Word, you can turn
on your "Show/Hide" markers.

00:23:12.362 --> 00:23:16.801
The "Show/Hide" markers,
the icon appears as a backwards P

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.750
if you're looking at it visually.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.310
They show where the extra spaces are
in your document which make it really easy

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.410
to find and delete
the ones you don't want.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.970
Also be mindful
of the size of your margins.

00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:31.674
Again, changing margin sizes
can cause problems.

00:23:32.341 --> 00:23:35.910
If you don't have to touch them
then I'd steer people away

00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:37.461
from playing with your margins.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.379
One of the reasons why we use
the Enter key to create space on a page is

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.830
for screen reader experience.

00:23:45.051 --> 00:23:47.777
Often screen reader users might get
to spaces on the page and just hear,

00:23:47.777 --> 00:23:48.911
"Enter, enter"--

00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.920
sorry, they'll hear,
"Blank, blank, blank,"

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.950
until they get to the next bit of content

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.841
which isn't the best user experience.

00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:00.180
Images and alt text.

00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:04.290
I definitely couldn't talk
about accessible documents without talking

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.420
about alternative text, it's so important.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.370
Any images that you use
in a document need alternative text.

00:24:12.571 --> 00:24:16.081
It's also commonly referred to as alt text
and that is how I'm going to refer to it

00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:17.081
from now on.

00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:20.821
There are various ways you can add
alternative text to images

00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:23.121
and most software programs
make it pretty easy.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.350
Most of the time, if you right-click
or you choose the properties of your image

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.650
using the Properties menu,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.181
you'll be able to add
alternative text to your image.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.249
What I would say is often get
people who will allow

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.671
the automation of your software
to add alternative text itself.

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.251
I would always double check this.

00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:47.417
Software, in my experience at the moment,
is not necessarily great

00:24:47.417 --> 00:24:48.417
at getting it right.

00:24:48.627 --> 00:24:54.239
Alt text is very context-dependent
and what you want to say is very,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.710
very personal to what you're editing
rather than necessarily something generic.

00:24:59.761 --> 00:25:02.431
Just tell the user what they need
to know and don't overload them

00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:03.431
with other content.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.231
I have an example of alt text here
and I've given some different variations.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.089
Images can make you feel
a particular way and that's something

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.110
that should be available to everybody,
even people that use screen readers.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.351
People often forget
that with pictures because they think,

00:25:22.351 --> 00:25:26.011
"Oh, they're very visual
so I can't describe them."

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.051
You absolutely can and you should.

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:32.088
The picture on this slide is
a large great dame with a wild look,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.670
catching a treat mid-air
with his mouth wide open.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.461
An example of bad alt text
for this image would be something like,

00:25:38.461 --> 00:25:40.472
"Image 342.jpg."

00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:42.021
It's just the file name,

00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:44.341
doesn't say anything,
it's really unhelpful.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.660
Something that's okay could be,
"Dog with its mouth wide open."

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.551
It's quite literal,

00:25:50.641 --> 00:25:53.384
that is exactly what the picture
is of, but actually,

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.041
to me there's more to this picture
than meets the eye.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.485
In my description I said the dog
had a wild look in its eye.

00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:04.351
I talked about the fact that his mouth
was wide open with him catching

00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:05.351
a treat mid-air.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.530
The lips are flopping open.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.350
That tells me a lot more about that image.

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:11.819
It's comical.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.380
I'm getting a nice feeling from that.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.151
I'm getting a good emotion from that.

00:26:15.151 --> 00:26:17.130
I feel like I want to smile
at that description,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.390
it sounds quite funny,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.181
and that's what I want
to get across to any user,

00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:24.931
no matter what tech they're using
or how they're accessing that information.

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:28.751
Always think about how you're writing
alt text and what it says

00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:31.470
because you might be using
that image for a particular reason

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.570
and your alternative text should say that.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.001
Finally thinking
about formatting link text.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.940
I've got a very grumpy
looking dog on this slide,

00:26:42.151 --> 00:26:43.321
got wild hair,

00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:46.200
and this is how I feel
when I review documents that have

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.580
inaccessible link text.

00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:50.789
We often see, "Click here,
read more information,"

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.401
used in isolation
with no surrounding context.

00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:57.180
Screen reader users often will bring up
a list of links to navigate

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.780
through the content and having
link text like that is really unhelpful

00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:03.631
and doesn't tell the user
where they're going to be taken.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.890
Make sure you don't use full URLs
and just make your link text descriptive.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.500
Finally on Word documents,
just don't forget that designing

00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:15.810
for neurodiversity is often overlooked.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.721
I've got a dog image
on this slide of a black Labrador

00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.221
with big brown eyes
looking lovingly at the camera,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.211
and the words read, "Don't forget me."

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.661
That's trying to signify that although,
we haven't covered everything

00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:28.661
in this section,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.770
things like using
plain English, don't use bold,

00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:36.509
italics, or underline in big amounts,
and making sure you're checking

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.050
your color contrast, is
all still really important

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.810
even if we haven't mentioned
it specifically today.

00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:46.531
Moving on as time is ticking,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.910
we're going to talk
about polished presentations

00:27:49.341 --> 00:27:52.470
and what we can do
in a presentation format to make sure

00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.471
they're accessible.

00:27:56.661 --> 00:27:58.411
Use the master slide.

00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:02.866
Slide master or the master
slide create accessible layouts

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:05.310
and ensure consistency
across your presentation.

00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:11.279
If you're using Microsoft PowerPoint,
you can view the slide master under

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.480
the View tab but all software
will have a version of a master layout.

00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.510
Make sure your master layout
is accessible,

00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:20.040
so make sure the colors work.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.660
If you're using any logos or anything,
they are also accessible but it's really,

00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:28.170
really important to make sure
that you do use that within your slides.

00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:34.801
Sections are also a nice way
in a presentation to give it structure.

00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:37.381
If you've got a particularly
long presentation,

00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:41.069
adding sections can be a nice way
to split the information

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.439
into several different topic areas,
and again,

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.725
the user can then navigate to the bits
that they maybe want to read more about

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:50.101
or go back to and revisit sections
they were unsure about.

00:28:51.307 --> 00:28:55.980
It's similar to how a table of contents
might help to break up content.

00:28:56.571 --> 00:28:59.910
Again, it's really important to think
about that when you're creating

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.710
those sections in your presentation.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.460
Unique slide titles are
a very, very important thing

00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:10.021
for accessible presentations.

00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:14.520
You must have unique descriptive titles
on each slide even if they're not visible

00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.071
but that is not advisable best practice.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.400
Visible headings are always
the best way to go.

00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:22.829
Screen reader users might rely
on the slide titles

00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:26.041
to know which slide they're on
and to know whether they've moved on

00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:28.771
or moved backwards a slide
depending on their command.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.178
If you're skimming
or using a screen reader,

00:29:32.178 --> 00:29:35.188
they can quickly scan through those titles
as well and go to the slide

00:29:35.188 --> 00:29:36.230
that they want.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.211
If you've got multiple slides
with the same information,

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:42.051
consider adding
a "One," a "Continued,"

00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:45.810
or some kind of note on in the slide title
to make it clear that it is

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.300
a different slide
but contains very similar information.

00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:54.957
Some formatting tips for you.

00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:57.104
Now, these are very similar
to the Word ones,

00:29:57.104 --> 00:30:00.381
so there isn't much difference here,
but there is a few more things to think

00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:02.731
about when it comes
to formatting presentations.

00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:05.824
Again, I've got a very grumpy,
angry looking dog

00:30:06.064 --> 00:30:07.604
because these are some of the things

00:30:07.604 --> 00:30:11.029
that I think people forget
about when it comes to presentations,

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.830
but they are still really important.

00:30:13.521 --> 00:30:15.981
Using a readable font is very important.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.140
Be generous with your spacing still.

00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:20.671
Don't make slides
that are packed with information.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.200
Make sure there's
enough space between content.

00:30:23.661 --> 00:30:24.920
Don't use transitions,

00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:27.950
keep links short and descriptive,
be mindful of your jargon,

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.160
and as we've said, make sure
your slide titles are unique.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.250
They're quite specific
to PowerPoint in some ways,

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.471
because if you're presenting
this information,

00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:37.771
the text has got to be big

00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:41.070
and you've got to make sure
that you're presenting information

00:30:41.071 --> 00:30:43.911
in a way that's quick,
easy and easy to digest.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.851
Sometimes they're overlooked
when creating PowerPoints

00:30:46.851 --> 00:30:49.401
because there's so many other things
to think about.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.051
One final tip I would give
if you are creating presentations,

00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:55.801
just think about your use of color.

00:30:56.781 --> 00:30:59.210
Don't use color on its own
to specify anything.

00:31:00.021 --> 00:31:02.566
If you're giving a presentation,
be mindful that people

00:31:02.566 --> 00:31:05.516
are going to be experiencing
those slides in different ways.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.649
On this slide I have two circles;
one is red and the other is red

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.650
with the letter A.

00:31:11.691 --> 00:31:14.330
To avoid indicating with color alone,

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:16.940
if you say something like,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.916
"Highlighted in red is--"

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:19.010
not everyone's going to know

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.080
what that is or where it is on the slide.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.951
Instead I would say, "Labelled
with letter A and colored red."

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.621
There may be some people in your audience
who are not viewing the screen at all.

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.671
Send the slides in advance,
so having those short descriptions

00:31:32.811 --> 00:31:35.361
is also really, really helpful
in the notes section.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.151
We move
into our final section of the session

00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:45.110
which is on Excel spreadsheets
or spreadsheets in general and thinking

00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:47.661
about how we can create
excellent versions of those.

00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:53.871
The first thing to think
about with spreadsheets is index sheets,

00:31:53.877 --> 00:31:55.550
and they are really important.

00:31:57.351 --> 00:31:59.120
If you have several sheets
in your workbook,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.731
it's really helpful
to provide an index sheet

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.290
at the beginning.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.890
That should tell the user
what the workbook is about

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.278
and provide a contents list,
which is hyperlinked to each sheet.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.891
It might be quite obvious
why that's important and hopefully it is.

00:32:12.891 --> 00:32:15.771
It's so that users can access
the information clearly,

00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:19.791
they know what that spreadsheet is about,
and they can really delve into details

00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:20.791
straight away.

00:32:22.968 --> 00:32:27.801
Cell A1 is such an important cell
but often is not thought about too much.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.260
It should never be left blank.

00:32:30.831 --> 00:32:32.361
There are different ways
you can use it though

00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:34.071
and this is where it gets interesting.

00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:35.321
That's why on this slide,

00:32:35.481 --> 00:32:39.831
I have a beagle with a magnifying glass
looking as if he's thinking,

00:32:40.089 --> 00:32:41.089
"How can I use it?"

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.880
He's trying to answer that question.

00:32:45.411 --> 00:32:49.941
On the first sheet, Cell A1
can be used to give a workbook summary.

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:54.291
As described in the previous section,
that's how that cell can be used.

00:32:55.632 --> 00:32:59.930
On any worksheet, Cell A1 can also be used
for the title of the table that follows.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.470
It very much depends
on how big your spreadsheet is

00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:07.092
and how you've set it up
as to how you might use Cell A1.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.471
Name your sheets and name your tables.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.370
It's important that you name your file
and name your worksheets in Excel.

00:33:17.201 --> 00:33:21.356
By default, worksheets
are normally named sheet 1, sheet 2,

00:33:21.676 --> 00:33:23.959
but you should rename these
and give them some more

00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:25.010
of a meaningful name.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.780
Why is that?

00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:30.331
Well, that just helps the user know
what the information is inside them.

00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:32.120
As with any application,

00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:34.730
it's important that tables
are properly created

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.370
with correctly marked up header rows
and columns,

00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:40.371
very much like we said
about using them in a normal document.

00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:43.880
However, you can convert
data into an accessible table

00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:45.581
which makes it easier to navigate.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.341
If you want to give
your table a descriptive name,

00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:52.341
normally under the table tab there'll be
a section that says,

00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:53.641
"Table Name."

00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:55.811
Make sure you add something in there.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.990
The more descriptive the better
as with all of these things.

00:34:05.111 --> 00:34:07.615
No blanking, no merging.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.679
Do not merge or split cells.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.790
Very similar to what we,

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.551
again, discussed in a Word document,
for example.

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:16.641
It creates an irregular pattern
and can make the data quite hard

00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:17.641
to understand.

00:34:18.742 --> 00:34:21.221
Screen reader users
might often count table cells

00:34:21.222 --> 00:34:22.971
to keep track of their location,

00:34:22.979 --> 00:34:26.511
so when you nest tables,
you merge or split cells,

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:29.600
it can be hard to keep count
and that doesn't really provide

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.921
much helpful information.

00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:35.449
It's recommended that any blank cells
are replaced with something.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.520
We don't like to leave cells blank,
so either an NA for not applicable,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.991
or a dash, or a hyphen.

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:46.101
Again, that one's not necessarily the best
because it can have multiple meanings,

00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:47.951
but maybe even putting zero in there,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.960
if it's a budget sheet,
just so that you've covered something

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.560
in there that doesn't affect
the rest of the content.

00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:59.331
When you have data in a tabular format,
if there are any empty rows or columns

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.081
then the user may assume
they've reached the end of that data,

00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:06.530
so try and delete anything
that is empty, doesn't serve a purpose

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.601
and is just there
because you thought you might add

00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:10.151
more information but never did.

00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:14.540
It just makes things more confusing
if we don't clean up our spreadsheet,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.080
I suppose, once we've finished editing it,
so just make sure you think

00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:20.581
about that when you're finalizing
your spreadsheet.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.111
That was just a whistle-stop tour
of accessible spreadsheets,

00:35:27.371 --> 00:35:29.671
and I've ended with a dog
with its nose really,

00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:31.021
really close to the camera,

00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:33.650
almost blurry because he's so close.

00:35:34.161 --> 00:35:37.220
I just think sometimes you've got to look
a little bit deeper when you're looking

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.361
at Excel spreadsheets.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:43.459
There's a lot to think about when it comes
to accessibility and it can be hard to see

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.840
where you've left a blank cell
or you've got an empty row there

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.040
that you didn't realize.

00:35:47.252 --> 00:35:50.990
Just have a double-check and make
sure it is as clean as possible.

00:35:53.757 --> 00:35:55.880
In our final five minutes,
I'm going to leave you

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.630
with some final thoughts of my own.

00:35:57.801 --> 00:36:01.160
Hopefully, you got some good tips today,
things maybe you didn't know

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.491
or just to help for your refresher
or a reminder if you're more proficient

00:36:04.491 --> 00:36:05.491
in this space.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.670
Some best practice to remember.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.670
To finish us off and to finalize this,
I've got a white dog

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.120
winking at the camera
with its mouth open just,

00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:19.411
"Remember this best practice if you can."

00:36:20.301 --> 00:36:23.480
If your document is not for personal use,
so just for yourself,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.531
it should be tested and verified
to make sure it is accessible.

00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:31.501
You don't necessarily know
where that document is going to end up.

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:34.161
Actually, even if you're sharing it
with two or three colleagues,

00:36:34.161 --> 00:36:36.740
you might not necessarily know
any access needs

00:36:36.741 --> 00:36:41.089
or accessibility requirements they have,
so producing accessible content sets

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.449
a really nice precedent
and gives you an opportunity to make sure

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.100
that you're providing
inclusive content for everybody.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.040
Remember that producing
two versions of a document is not ideal.

00:36:52.281 --> 00:36:54.620
We often hear from people,
"Oh, it's okay, I'll create

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.351
my version and then I'll create
an accessible version."

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.371
Having one accessible version is the best.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.810
We don't like to create one
for one person and one for the other.

00:37:04.851 --> 00:37:08.091
It's nice to be able to produce
one document that meets all requirements

00:37:08.091 --> 00:37:09.380
or as many as possible.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.071
Remember to test
at every stage of development.

00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:15.951
Just like you would if you were creating
a digital product on the web,

00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:16.951
for example,

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.250
make sure you're checking
document accessibility at every turn.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.131
That will help to make sure
that when you get to the end of editing

00:37:24.132 --> 00:37:27.192
or end of creating your document
you've pretty much encountered

00:37:27.192 --> 00:37:29.592
everything and built everything in,
and you don't have to think

00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:32.991
about running checks at that point
and making substantial changes,

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.970
which might disrupt what you'd planned.

00:37:37.691 --> 00:37:41.120
With all accessibility things,
I think I've said this multiple times

00:37:41.121 --> 00:37:42.121
over the years,

00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:44.900
build in accessibility from the beginning.

00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:48.649
If you're using an accessible template,
if you're using the right tools

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.011
and the right software,
you can create an accessible document

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.649
in a relatively easy way,
and it doesn't have

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.290
to be this big chore
that I think is often associated

00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.041
with creating accessible documents.

00:37:59.957 --> 00:38:02.690
Consider it from the beginning,
and if you're not the document owner

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:03.690
or the editor,

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:07.011
try and plant that seed in others' minds
when you're hearing about and creating

00:38:07.011 --> 00:38:10.189
content so that you can make
sure that content is created

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.990
in an accessible way from the start.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.900
I just want to end.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.941
I know we're going
to go down to questions now,

00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:19.041
but thank you so much for your time today.

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:22.070
I really appreciate you listening to me
from wherever you are

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.170
and whatever time of day it is,
and I hope you found it useful.

00:38:25.491 --> 00:38:26.571
Thank you very much.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.379
Host: Thank you, Samantha.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.777
We're going to jump into Q&A.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.639
I think if you read the chat,
a lot of them appreciated your dogs

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.083
as well as you and all
the information that you've given.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.960
We're going to answer Gerson's first,
and his question is,

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.820
is Adobe Acrobat really
the only proper tool

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.753
to make PDFs tagged and accessible?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.419
Samantha Meritt: Really good,
great question.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.639
No, Adobe Acrobat is definitely
not the only proper tool you can use.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.439
It's probably the most widely known

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.879
and probably most widely used,
or at least is in my sphere,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.329
which is why I talked
about it in the presentation.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.859
But there are lots of alternatives.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.939
There's lots of companies out there

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.699
that can offer
paid-for versions as well.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.919
My piece of advice
to you would just be careful.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.609
Some of them are advertised as
remediation tools, fully automated.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.129
Of course, we know
with all sorts of accessibility,

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.619
one size doesn't fit all,
so it's not going to deliver you

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.139
an accessible solution.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.269
So maybe you'll always need
to do a bit of manual work.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.099
There are also tools like PAC

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.049
that is a free tool
that I use quite a bit.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.059
It goes one step further than Acrobat

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.279
and does full PDF/UA compliance,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.969
which I find really helpful
when you're trying to fix PDFs.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.359
Again, just have a look and make sure
you choose the right tool

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.739
that works for you,
but you don't have to use Acrobat

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.476
if you don't want to.

00:39:49.872 --> 00:39:50.619
Host: It's good to know.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.979
I just learned that too.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.290
I thought Acrobat was the only one,
so thank you.

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.349
Thank you for sharing that.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.160
The next question we have is from,

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.759
I'm not going to try
to pronounce this.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:10.240
I use PAC 2024 for checking PDFs
and the Acrobat built-in functions.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.329
Can you recommend
other tools that we could use?

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.359
Samantha: Kind of similar question,
I guess, to the last one in a way.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.349
There's another free tool
called PAVE, which you can use.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:23.919
That's mostly up for files
that are less than five megabytes.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.709
It depends on the size
of your file on that one.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.359
But there are also lots
of paid-for tools.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.819
I don't use any of them myself,

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.929
so I can't recommend
one or the other.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.153
But there are lots of names
like CommonLit PDF, Axes 4, Equidox.

00:40:36.154 --> 00:40:38.679
These are all examples
of other tools in the market.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.289
As I say, I don't know
much about any of them.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.191
I just know they exist.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.219
Host: All right. Thank you so much.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.156
Then we have a couple from Claire [?]

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:52.991
If an image in a document
is decorative, what should you do?

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.689
Samantha: Yes, really good question.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.249
It can be tackled
in a couple of ways.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.469
There is a mark decorative box.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.939
However, I always try and steer
people away from using that

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.649
because I think an image
will always normally have a purpose.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.869
You will have put
it in there for some reason.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.609
For example,
if you talk about healthy eating

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.899
and you've got a picture of an apple,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.129
you've put
it in there because you think

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.409
that's an example
of something healthy to eat.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.979
I would probably describe
that so people get an understanding

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.889
about what you mean when you say
healthy eating in your context.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:24.189
There's very few instances
where images are purely decorative.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.379
If I'm using a logo,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.089
it's because I want to make sure that
people know that document is owned

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.549
by that organization, for example.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.709
Always consider
how decorative it really is.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.339
If you really don't think
it adds any extra value, one,

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.899
maybe consider removing it.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.539
If you really do think it should
be there, then maybe add some,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.179
you can tick the mark
as decorative box, but we really,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.109
really use that in cases
where there's really no added value

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.309
to adding a description at all,

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.801
which in most cases
is quite rare, I believe.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:55.179
But that box is always
there if you need to use it.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.299
Host: All right, thank you.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.960
Then the next question is,
you said don't use underline

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.185
in documents, but is this
not best practice for links?

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.619
Samantha: Absolutely.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.089
Apologies if that came
over in the wrong way.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.739
That's not what I intended
at all from that comment.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.419
Links should always be underlined.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.619
The reason why we don't
underline anything else

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.939
is for the reason that people

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.899
can then hopefully
identify links with ease.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.819
If we just keep underline
limited to underlining links,

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.639
then people can scan documents

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.369
and find that information
visually quite easily.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.679
If we start underlining other things,
you might try and click

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.169
on it because you assume
it's probably a link and it's not,

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.669
and it can just get
a little bit confusing.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:34.899
So yes, absolutely.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.059
Keep your underline for links,
but links only.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.509
Host: Thank you
for the clarification.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.880
From Kwaku, we have,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.599
what's the single most common
accessibility mistake you see

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.529
in digital documents
and how could someone quickly fix it?

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:54.642
And what's one tip for a beginner
that beginners often overlook

00:42:54.643 --> 00:42:58.289
that can make document
instantly more accessible?

00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:59.179
Samantha: Yes, I love this question.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.519
There's quite a lot in there,
but actually

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.279
it's probably one answer
that can answer all of it.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.289
I think for me,
the most common mistake

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.739
is headings or lack
of heading structure.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.819
People are often,
through no fault of their own,

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.529
because they don't realize
it's there,

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.509
not make something
a heading through formatting

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.659
and just make it size 25,
bold, and say, look,

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.299
visually that looks like a heading.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.409
Yes, you're not wrong,
it does, but actually

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.629
from a formatting
and accessibility perspective,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.269
that doesn't help
the structure of the document,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.350
makes it really hard to navigate
and gives it no kind of structure

00:43:29.351 --> 00:43:31.839
or easy to navigable
table of contents either,

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.731
which is really
important for documents.

00:43:34.732 --> 00:43:36.729
The same goes
for a presentation as well.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.745
Every slide should need
a unique title.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.799
That's effectively
a heading in a document.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.789
There's no difference really,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.439
it's just the way
that the documents are set out.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.409
For me, the most common
mistake is no headings,

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.239
which then means that you
don't have a good table of contents.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.459
You can't navigate easily.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.379
The knock-on effects
of that are quite wide.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.599
If you just add headings,
you've instantly made

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.179
your document much easier
to make your way through.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.999
So if you're a beginner in this space

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.619
and you're a little bit overwhelmed,

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.232
there was quite a lot
in that presentation

00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:05.699
because I wanted to try and get

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.329
across quite a bit
in a short amount of time.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.359
But I think
alternative text and adding

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.099
in headings are really crucial,

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.259
and if you do that throughout
your document,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.029
as a beginner,
you can make a big impact

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.839
on the final accessible
output in a way that other tips

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.776
might not have as overarching effect.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.849
Host: Thank you so much.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.668
We have one from Taco.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.670
How accessible are the generated PDF

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.189
versions of PowerPoint slide decks?

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.920
Is Google Sheets better or worse?

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.719
Samantha: They're not very accessible
is the short answer

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.029
to that, which helps
to keep it simple.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.519
But yes, PowerPoint slides

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.179
that are converted to PDF,
the two document types

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.439
were never meant to be compatible.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.809
PowerPoints are used
for presentations.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.000
It's very unlikely that
they are ever produced

00:44:55.001 --> 00:44:58.239
to be in PDF format because PDFs
have a very different use case.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.849
It's not impossible
to make them accessible,

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.039
but it's not very easy at all,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.112
especially if you've got
extra bits in there,

00:45:05.113 --> 00:45:08.289
like images and lots
of other things in a PowerPoint deck,

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.369
which you probably would have

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.739
because that's how PowerPoints
are normally designed.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.159
Making that accessible in PDF
format can be quite tricky.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.729
Google Slides, Google,
any kind of Google product,

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.949
again, I don't think
it's any particularly better.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:22.799
I think it's always
going to be problematic

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.629
converting a presentation into a PDF.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.121
The two are just not
going to work very well.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.669
Host: Thank you. Thank you for that.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:35.109
Again, I'm learning something
as I'm asking these questions.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:39.129
From Isabel, do you think
that the accessibility checker

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:44.049
of PowerPoint is helpful for making
an accessible presentation?

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.579
Samantha: Absolutely.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.199
I always, always, always,

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.359
and in any kind of product
where you've got

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.454
an accessibility checker,
please use it.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.750
We always say that don't rely on it.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.629
I always say to people,
it's your starting point.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.189
When you've finished,
you've got your document ready,

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.919
you think it's good to go,
run the checker on it,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.639
and then action anything
that comes out of that.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.359
But then there's a few more manual
checks that you also need to do.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.221
So it won't cover everything.

00:46:09.222 --> 00:46:12.303
For example, it doesn't check
all types of color contrast.

00:46:12.304 --> 00:46:14.709
It will check if you've got
bright red text

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:17.799
in a white background or something
that's kind of more obvious

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.569
when it comes to color contrast.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.039
But if you're using two blues

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.039
that are just slightly off contrast
when it comes to the ratios,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.749
it wouldn't necessarily pick that up,

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.459
so therefore you checking
that manually

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.259
is gonna give you the best result.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.539
Similarly, if you've got links

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.319
in your presentation
or your document,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.099
and you've just put them in as URLs,

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.459
it's not going to pick up
that's an accessibility issue,

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.039
but that really
is an accessibility problem

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.949
that we would need
to check through manually.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.419
The checkers are brilliant.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.019
If you're a beginner in this space,
they often explain

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.139
why it's a problem and how to fix it,
which is brilliant.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.419
But don't rely on them alone
because they don't cover everything

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.205
and they will miss bits.

00:46:54.206 --> 00:46:56.819
So you will always be more
powerful than the checker,

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.079
which is what I like to tell people.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.019
Host: All right, thank you.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.020
Thank you.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.629
And we have one final
question from Sally.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.359
Does compressing a PDF
affect its accessibility?

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.599
Samantha: This is a great question

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.410
and unfortunately
I can't say yes or no,

00:47:12.411 --> 00:47:13.809
or give a really point blank answer

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.629
because it depends
on how the compression is done

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.629
and what elements are removed
when it is compressed.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.359
Often compressing
a PDF will flatten it.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.399
It will turn the text
and structure into images,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.789
which can obviously remove tags,
reading order or text,

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.319
some of that interactive
elements if you've got

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.479
form fields and things
like that in there.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.219
It can also remove embedded fonts,

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.039
which can cause
problems for accessibility.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.749
And some third party tools that
compress them can remove metadata

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.339
to try and reduce file size,

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.752
which removes titles
and authors, et cetera.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:47.679
My best advice,

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.539
if you do need to compress
a PDF file is do it and then use

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.809
a tool like your
Adobe Acrobat, your PAC,

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.629
whatever it is you use
to check accessibility,

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.219
to check what it looks
like after you've compressed it,

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.819
and then you might need
to add some of those bits back in

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.519
because those things are fundamental
for an accessible PDF.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.559
We can't ignore
that they need to be in there.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.859
Don't let it affect
the accessibility of your final file.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.039
Host: All right, thank you so much.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.579
I think we've answered
all of the questions.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.839
Well, I think you've answered
all of the questions rather.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.739
Thank you again.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.329
Thank you so much
for the presentation.

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:23.860
I think it was hyper-educational
and we appreciate it.

00:48:24.702 --> 00:48:25.379
Samantha: Oh, thank you.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.499
No, it was really good,
and thank you everyone

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.999
for chiming in and engaging.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.901
It's been really great.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.739
Host: Okay, so for the chat,
thank you for attending
