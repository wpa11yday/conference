<v Alicia St Rose> Welcome to WordPress

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:37.205
Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:41.264
My name is Alicia St Rose
from WP with Heart.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.413
Thank you for joining us
for The Future is Automated,

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:47.563
But Will It Be Accessible?

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:49.396
with Rose Kivuva.

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:53.187
Rose is a software developer,
open source contributor,

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:57.091
and a passionate accessibility
advocate based in Kenya.

00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:00.394
She has worked
with organizations like Ushahidi,

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:02.263
building and improving platforms

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:04.365
that serve people
in critical moments,

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.001
while ensuring
technology is inclusive

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.233
and accessible to everyone.

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:13.307
Rose believes that accessibility
is not just about compliance,

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:17.311
but about dignity,
equal opportunity, and good design.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.815
She enjoys sharing practical,
real-world strategies

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:22.783
to help developers, designers,

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:27.021
and content creators build ethical,
inclusive technology

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.171
that leaves no one behind.

00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:31.891
Please feel free
to add your questions

00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:33.994
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.098
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.018
Also, remember to use the chat
to connect with other attendees.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:46.169
<v Rose Kivuva> Hello, everyone.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:51.613
I'm Rose Kivuva, joining
you right from Nairobi, Kenya.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.751
I'm a software developer,
an open source contributor,

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.288
and an accessibility advocate.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.492
Day by day, I help teams build tools

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:07.996
that real people can actually use.

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:14.002
Outside work,
I'm a big fan of quiet moments.

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:17.973
Could be long walks, weekend hikes,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.343
and taking time
to just notice the small,

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:27.047
small things around me, like paths,

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:30.318
clouds, and how light changes.

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:33.889
Those moments, for me, remind me

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.125
why I really care about building tech

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:42.569
that slows down for people,
and not the other way around.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.182
My talk today is called,

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:50.472
The Future is Automated,
But Will It Be Accessible?

00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:54.475
We are seeing AI,
which is artificial intelligence,

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.678
show up everywhere in WordPress,

00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:02.117
in content writing,
image creation, chatbots,

00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:05.554
search, and even layouts.

00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:08.723
AI is really, really powerful.

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:11.993
I think we all can agree to that,

00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:15.096
and exciting at the same time.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.968
But power without care
can really push people out.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:24.972
The heart of this session
is just one simple question.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:29.678
As we automate more,
are we including everyone,

00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:33.615
or are we quietly leaving
some people behind?

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:37.885
I'll use plain English, real stories,

00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:42.123
and steps that we can use
right away moving forward.

00:04:42.457 --> 00:04:48.129
My goal is that we all leave
here feeling confident,

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:54.336
and a little
more protective of our user.

00:04:58.373 --> 00:05:01.576
Why this talk really matters?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.271
Let's start with the word
accessibility.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:12.286
Accessibility means that everyone
can use what we build,

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:15.724
including people who are blind,

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:21.496
those who have low vision,
deaf, or hard of hearing,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.227
people with limited mobility,

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.267
people with speech differences,

00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.236
and people who process
information differently,

00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:33.875
like ADHD, autism, or brain injury.

00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:39.361
There are over a billion people
in the world with disabilities.

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:42.381
That's not a small group.

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:46.588
Many of us, at some point,

00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:51.205
temporarily or permanently,
will rely on accessibility.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:55.463
Maybe you break a wrist
and can't use a mouse.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:59.701
Maybe you're in a noisy
cafe and need captions.

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.836
Maybe your eyes
are tired at midnight,

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:07.309
and you need clear text
and big buttons.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.750
Now add AI.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.647
AI is writing our posts,

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.786
drafting our emails,
picking our images,

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:22.691
as well as answering
our users at 2:00 AM.

00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:25.159
If we don't design with everyone

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.229
in mind, AI can speed up exclusion.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.497
Not because we are bad people,

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:34.369
but because we didn't slow
down to notice.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:39.538
Now today we slow down,
we notice, and we improve together.

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:44.279
I'll use a few terms during the talk.

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:47.881
AI is artificial intelligence.

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:49.917
This is the tech that predicts,

00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:53.188
generates, and recognizes patterns.

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.870
LLM, large language model,

00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:59.361
is the brain
behind many writing tools.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:04.899
WCAG is Web Content
Accessibility Guideline.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.439
This is our global rulebook
for making the web work for everyone.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:18.546
ARIA stands for Accessible
Rich Internet Applications.

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:22.650
Labels and roles
that help screen readers

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:26.287
understand complex widgets.

00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:31.459
NVDA for Windows and VoiceOver
for Apple as screen readers.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:35.058
These are softwares
that read the screen out loud

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:38.233
and let people
navigate without signs.

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:41.395
ASR, Automatic Speech Recognition,

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.969
this is speech-to-text.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.240
TTS is text-to-speech.

00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:49.444
I'll explain this naturally as we go.

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:53.148
If a term sounds scary, don't worry,

00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:56.885
I'll keep it simple
and very practical.

00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:01.435
Who gets left out?

00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:04.459
When automation moves fast,

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:08.963
who's being left out
or being left behind?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.999
Now imagine a blind student

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.304
relying on VoiceOver
to read course pages,

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.406
a deaf parent trying to catch

00:08:19.407 --> 00:08:22.777
a school announcement
without captions,

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:27.582
and a person with stutter
asking a chatbot for help

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:34.189
and always getting, "Sorry,
I didn't catch that," again and again.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.994
A shopper who uses only
a keyboard and is stuck

00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:42.559
in a pop-up with no escape.

00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:50.638
A new English speaker facing
a wall of long and formal AI texts.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.408
These are not edge cases.

00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:55.376
These are our users.

00:08:55.877 --> 00:09:00.248
These are us
at different time of our lives.

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:04.284
Accessibility,
I believe, isn't charity.

00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:08.790
It's just good design
and basic respect.

00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:12.593
I want to tell you a very short story

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:17.565
to why I really relate to this.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:21.202
A friend of mine, she's blind,

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:24.429
was applying for a community grant.

00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:30.211
A shiny AI chatbot auto-launched
and stole the screen focus.

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:35.334
Her screen reader could not reach
the form fields anymore.

00:09:35.517 --> 00:09:37.197
She tried and tried.

00:09:37.218 --> 00:09:38.418
Then she said,

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:42.703
"I feel like the internet
is not built for me anymore."

00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:46.027
That sentence changed me.

00:09:46.361 --> 00:09:47.427
I'm a developer.

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:51.799
I can ship features,
but can I ship belonging?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.835
Can I ship calm?

00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:57.105
Can I ship an experience that says,

00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:01.576
"You're welcome here
exactly as you are?"

00:10:01.943 --> 00:10:03.477
That's why I care.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:07.315
That's why I'm here
with you today for this talk.

00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:11.119
Where AI breaks,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:15.857
let me name a few pain
points with you right now.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.595
In voice and chat,
a search struggles with accents,

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:25.300
stutter and soft voices,
as well as loud speeches.

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:29.102
It keeps saying, "Sorry,
I didn't get that."

00:10:29.103 --> 00:10:30.783
That becomes a wall.

00:10:30.939 --> 00:10:36.010
In images, AI generators
make really, really beautiful images.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:44.652
Often forgets alt text,
which is alternative text for images.

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:50.758
That's a short description
of images that screen readers need.

00:10:52.627 --> 00:10:56.206
In writings, LLMs love

00:10:56.207 --> 00:10:59.801
long, long sentences
and very big words.

00:11:00.134 --> 00:11:04.656
For many readers, simple
is kind and complex is a barrier.

00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:09.910
When it comes to keyboard,
AI-made pop-up can trap

00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:13.281
the tab focus, tab key.

00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:16.517
Then now the focus disappears.

00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:20.088
The close button is now unreachable.

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:23.223
When it comes to data bias,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:27.494
now if training data
rarely includes disability

00:11:27.495 --> 00:11:29.364
or global diversity,

00:11:29.697 --> 00:11:34.035
AI keeps to ignore
those patterns over and over.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.171
These are not rare bugs.

00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:40.672
They are common patterns we can fix.

00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:48.316
WordPress powers over 40% of the web.

00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:51.019
That's amazing.

00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:58.426
It also means our choices are scale.

00:12:00.395 --> 00:12:04.095
AI is arriving in SEOs,

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:07.669
helpers, writing assistants,

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:13.808
image tools, chart widgets,
and layout generators.

00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:19.547
If a plugin forgets alt
text or keyboard focus,

00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:25.153
that mistake travels to thousands
and thousands of sites.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.756
The flip side is beautiful.

00:12:33.428 --> 00:12:36.798
If a plugin does accessibility well,

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:41.269
that goodness spreads just as fast.

00:12:42.336 --> 00:12:45.205
We have a chance to lead the open web

00:12:45.206 --> 00:12:51.646
toward automation that is human,
careful, and kind.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.585
There are top fail patterns I see.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:02.290
One is no semantic HTML.

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:06.042
Pages built with random divs instead

00:13:06.043 --> 00:13:09.731
of real headings,
lists, and landmarks.

00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:13.367
Screen readers
can't map the structure.

00:13:14.068 --> 00:13:18.206
Two is low color contrast.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.877
Elegant gray on gray may look modern,

00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:27.048
but it's unreadable for many.

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:32.153
Then the other one is missing
ARIA labels and roles.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.822
Complex widgets
with no roles or names,

00:13:35.823 --> 00:13:38.893
assistive tech can't announce them.

00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:44.365
Then we have the keyboard
traps and lost focus.

00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:51.372
Modals open, or rather,
Pop-ups open and focus vanishes.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.442
Escape doesn't close anymore.

00:13:54.776 --> 00:13:57.011
Focus doesn't return.

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.213
No captions, as well,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.606
is the other example,
no captions and transcriptions.

00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:11.192
Videos and audios stay silent
to deaf or hard of hearing users.

00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:18.575
I can say none
of this is really mysterious.

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:22.637
It's just work
we must remember to do.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.776
Now,

00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:35.082
yes, I want to give
you examples we can really look at.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:38.352
Now let's imagine three quick scenes.

00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:41.189
One is the hero image.

00:14:42.657 --> 00:14:47.928
You use an AI tool
to create a hero image,

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:51.865
a girl painting a mural
without an alt text,

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:56.663
and a blind user hears "image.jpg".

00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:01.008
With alt text,

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:06.013
it says "a smiling girl
paints a bright school

00:15:06.047 --> 00:15:10.785
mural with blue and yellow colors."

00:15:11.352 --> 00:15:16.557
Suddenly, now the moment is shared.

00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:22.396
Scene two, the formal paragraph.

00:15:23.064 --> 00:15:29.837
AI writes commands,
"The onboarding procedure".

00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:33.006
Then you change it to,
"Start setting up."

00:15:33.007 --> 00:15:36.077
Fewer words, feels more welcoming.

00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:40.981
Then the third
one is now the chat trap,

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:44.352
like I mentioned with my friend.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:48.823
A chat widget opens
when the page loads.

00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:52.426
Tab can't reach the close button.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.175
Keyboard users
are stuck at that point.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.609
Now you add focus management,

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.104
send focus into the dialogue,
escape closes it.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:05.351
When it closes it,

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.842
return focuses
to the button that opened it.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.240
Now it feels more respectful,

00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:16.817
and more easy for those people
who are using the keyboard.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:20.402
Small changes, I can say

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:25.058
it's now showing big
dignity at this point,

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:27.995
the changes
that we are talking about.

00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:32.099
Simple and reliable fixes.

00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.605
Five fixes carry so much weight.

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:43.311
One is alt text with meaning,
not just logo or images.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:47.214
Paint the picture
in a short sentence.

00:16:47.748 --> 00:16:52.987
Then plain language,
short sentences, everyday words,

00:16:53.988 --> 00:16:59.126
headings, and bullets
as well to make things simpler.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:05.299
Then the semantic HTML,
so real buttons for buttons,

00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:10.371
and real links for links.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:15.075
Use headings in order
just to make sure

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.544
that everything is in flow,

00:17:17.545 --> 00:17:20.580
and things like screen
readers can understand

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.985
that will be read aloud to the users.

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:29.757
The other thing is managing focus.

00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:34.552
Now this is focus rules for modals.

00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:38.833
Move focus in,
keep the tab key inside,

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:44.338
and then escape closes,
return focuses back.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:48.075
Keep visible focus outline as well.

00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:51.946
The other one is caption
and transcriptions.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.318
Auto-captions are a start,
but edit them,

00:17:57.651 --> 00:18:00.855
provide transcripts
for audio as well.

00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:08.062
If we all do these five things,

00:18:08.396 --> 00:18:15.169
you remove so much
friction from so many lives.

00:18:17.838 --> 00:18:22.676
Tools that help us make sure
that we are doing this.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:27.114
Use tools to catch what AI misses.

00:18:27.448 --> 00:18:31.058
WAVE and axe DevTools,

00:18:31.438 --> 00:18:36.824
these are... flag missing labels,

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.252
contrast issues,
and structure problems.

00:18:40.394 --> 00:18:45.399
Then there's Chrome Lighthouse,
gives quick checks.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.805
NVDA in Windows and VoiceOver
on Mac or iPhone lets you feel

00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:55.743
the page like a blind user.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.281
Then there's Hemingway
and other readability

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:04.285
tools that help
you simplify LLM text.

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:07.398
Then there's contrast checkers

00:19:09.011 --> 00:19:15.162
to keep color contrast at all times.

00:19:15.629 --> 00:19:19.533
You run this regularly, and remember,

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:24.038
tools assist,
but us as humans decide.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.310
Building with AI, not against people.

00:19:29.944 --> 00:19:35.316
You can teach your AI
assistant to help you include.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:41.355
In your prompt say,
write a plain language,

00:19:41.689 --> 00:19:44.625
use headings and bullets,

00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:48.696
propose alt text for images,
and avoid jargons.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.331
Then do a human review.

00:19:51.332 --> 00:19:56.637
AI is fast, but it doesn't know
your users like you do.

00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:58.030
Add a small link.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.372
Was this accessible for you?

00:19:59.373 --> 00:20:00.975
Invite feedback.

00:20:01.871 --> 00:20:05.145
Moreso, especially from people
using screen readers,

00:20:05.146 --> 00:20:09.516
captions and keyboard
only or high zoom,

00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:12.797
10 minutes of honest
feedback from them

00:20:13.257 --> 00:20:16.991
beats the 10 meetings for us.

00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:19.527
Standard guides,

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:25.565
WCAG, Web Content
Accessibility Guideline,

00:20:25.566 --> 00:20:28.402
is now our compass at this point.

00:20:28.736 --> 00:20:33.407
Its core idea is POUR: perceivable,

00:20:33.874 --> 00:20:36.944
operable, understandable, robust.

00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:41.315
For perceivable, can people sense it?

00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:42.427
No.

00:20:42.428 --> 00:20:47.588
Things like alt text,
contrasts, captions.

00:20:47.939 --> 00:20:50.857
Operable, can people actually use it?

00:20:50.858 --> 00:20:54.394
These are keyboard access,
no traps, enough time.

00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:59.094
Understandable, can people
follow it using plain language,

00:20:59.095 --> 00:21:00.775
consistent patterns?

00:21:01.202 --> 00:21:05.172
Then, for robust,
does it work with assistive tech?

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:11.412
You don't have to memorize
the whole spec,

00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:15.540
but you can start with the low levels

00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:19.787
like A and AA basics.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:23.924
Each release fix one thing.

00:21:24.258 --> 00:21:27.628
That steady path is how team wins.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.401
Your role and my work.

00:21:36.403 --> 00:21:39.296
What does this look like in a team?

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:43.377
For developers,
designers, content folks,

00:21:43.711 --> 00:21:45.178
and product leads.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:51.552
For developers,
use real HTML elements, manage focus,

00:21:51.885 --> 00:21:55.693
add ARIA thoughtfully,
not only when it's needed.

00:21:55.723 --> 00:21:59.293
For designers,
choose strong contrast,

00:21:59.627 --> 00:22:05.266
avoid tiny text, reduce motion
that can trigger dizziness,

00:22:05.633 --> 00:22:08.802
and design clear focus states.

00:22:09.136 --> 00:22:11.795
For content folks, use headings

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:16.343
that make sense and keep
the sentences short.

00:22:16.677 --> 00:22:21.715
You can also define
acronyms and explain images.

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:27.187
For product leads,
make accessibility a must,

00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.752
not a nice to have, a must.

00:22:31.258 --> 00:22:36.864
About me, I work across these roles,

00:22:37.197 --> 00:22:42.670
helping teams ship features
that include more people.

00:22:43.003 --> 00:22:47.140
I've contributed
in open spaces like Ushahidi,

00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:49.275
as well as working with them,

00:22:49.276 --> 00:22:54.815
where accessible to support
communities in real moment,

00:22:55.149 --> 00:23:00.421
like elections, flood,
crisis reporting as well.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:03.790
Then outside my work,
like I mentioned,

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:07.461
I refill my energy
with walks and hikes.

00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:14.034
That quiet time helps me listen
better to nature and to users.

00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:18.839
It keeps my work more human as well.

00:23:19.973 --> 00:23:24.812
Looking ahead,
AI isn't going anywhere.

00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:27.294
It's even getting smarter.

00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:31.618
That means our choices
now matter even more.

00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:36.232
We can build a future
where automation is exclusive,

00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:40.260
fast for some, and closed for many.

00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:46.700
We build a future that is empowering,
faster, yes,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.872
but also fair, gentle,
and very, very welcoming.

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:56.757
Let's choose to build AI
that respects human diversity,

00:23:56.977 --> 00:24:01.215
that amplifies access,
and that works for everyone,

00:24:01.548 --> 00:24:06.787
no matter how they see,
they speak, read, or even move.

00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:14.294
Yes, thank you for spending
this time with me.

00:24:14.628 --> 00:24:17.630
You showed up
because you really care.

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:23.368
That already changes a lot
of things in this whole journey.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:28.175
If you carry just one thing
from this room, let it be this,

00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:33.714
the future is automated,
but it must also be accessible.

00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:37.742
I'll be live for a Q&amp;A
right after this.

00:24:38.218 --> 00:24:41.154
I'd love to hear
from your questions or stories.

00:24:41.155 --> 00:24:42.688
If you want to stay in touch

00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:48.595
and connect with me on LinkedIn,
sorry, Rose Kivuva.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:54.152
Yes, let's keep building a web
where nobody's left behind.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:59.505
If you need a walking
buddy on a conference break,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.208
I'm always up for a short walk.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.310
Thank you.

00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:04.644
Bye.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.808
<v Alicia St Rose> That was wonderful.

00:25:18.066 --> 00:25:19.465
Thank you so much, Rose.

00:25:19.485 --> 00:25:23.191
I love the way you started off
with recognizing the simple things.

00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:24.562
It was beautiful.

00:25:25.883 --> 00:25:28.543
We do have some questions.

00:25:28.564 --> 00:25:32.664
If anyone else has questions,
please put them in the Q&amp;A section.

00:25:32.734 --> 00:25:37.969
If there was anything in the chat,
we can move that over there.

00:25:38.013 --> 00:25:40.928
We have a question from Kwaku,

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:44.733
and the question is,

00:25:44.798 --> 00:25:47.981
"I think AI and automation

00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:53.194
gives us the opportunity to address
accessibility from the ground up.

00:25:53.311 --> 00:25:56.299
What's the best way
to convince people

00:25:56.581 --> 00:26:00.322
the benefit of accessibility in AI

00:26:00.342 --> 00:26:04.650
and not just something nice
for people with disabilities?"

00:26:06.902 --> 00:26:08.178
<v Rose Kivuva> Okay.

00:26:12.006 --> 00:26:13.098
Yes.

00:26:13.296 --> 00:26:14.533
Hi, everyone.

00:26:15.455 --> 00:26:17.790
Thank you, Kwaku, for the question.

00:26:17.827 --> 00:26:20.674
You are absolutely right.

00:26:20.695 --> 00:26:23.469
AI and automation

00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:27.819
gives us
the once-in-a-generation chance

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:31.587
to build accessibility
right from the foundation

00:26:31.607 --> 00:26:34.858
and not just as an afterthought.

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:38.223
When it comes to convincing people,

00:26:38.793 --> 00:26:43.367
I think the best place to start
is shifting how we frame--

00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:45.714
Oh, sorry.

00:26:45.757 --> 00:26:48.083
Sorry, sorry.

00:26:48.818 --> 00:26:50.018
<v Alicia> There she is.

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:51.108
<v Rose> Can you see me?

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:53.180
<v Alicia> Yes, we can see you now.

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:54.413
<v Rose> Perfect.

00:26:54.434 --> 00:26:57.796
When it comes to convincing people,

00:26:58.055 --> 00:27:01.345
I think the best place
to start is shifting

00:27:01.365 --> 00:27:04.258
how we frame accessibility.

00:27:04.894 --> 00:27:09.833
It's not about special features
for people with disabilities.

00:27:09.853 --> 00:27:13.854
It's about designing
for human diversity.

00:27:13.893 --> 00:27:16.992
Accessibility makes things
better for everyone.

00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:19.089
For example,

00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:24.466
think about voice assistants
like Siri or Alexa.

00:27:24.932 --> 00:27:30.755
They were created to help
people use tech hands-free, right?

00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:34.676
Now, almost everyone
uses them while cooking,

00:27:34.687 --> 00:27:36.884
driving, or even multitasking.

00:27:37.082 --> 00:27:43.198
That's an inclusive design
benefiting all users.

00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:47.978
Even another example
is automatic captions.

00:27:48.355 --> 00:27:49.436
Initially,

00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:54.198
it was designed for deaf
or hard of hearing community,

00:27:54.332 --> 00:27:59.730
but now, they help people
watch videos in noisy places

00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:03.753
or even learning new languages.

00:28:04.056 --> 00:28:08.135
Instead of saying
accessibility is nice to have,

00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:13.112
we show how it's good for innovation,

00:28:13.329 --> 00:28:16.444
business, and society at large.

00:28:16.684 --> 00:28:20.225
Accessibility opens your product
to more users,

00:28:20.255 --> 00:28:23.871
more market, and more loyalty.

00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:28.230
Now, I think the most convincing way

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.337
is to let people
experience the difference.

00:28:31.413 --> 00:28:34.082
Give them examples, show demos,

00:28:34.204 --> 00:28:35.389
tell stories.

00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:40.262
Once they see
how accessibility improves usability

00:28:40.282 --> 00:28:42.107
and human connection,

00:28:42.127 --> 00:28:46.742
then it stops feeling like charity
and starts feeling like smart design.

00:28:47.082 --> 00:28:48.654
<v Alicia> I like that.

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:50.269
I do.

00:28:52.546 --> 00:28:54.583
Let's see here.

00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:55.765
Oh, here we go.

00:28:55.786 --> 00:28:57.277
We have another one.

00:28:59.043 --> 00:29:00.598
This is from Ricky.

00:29:00.633 --> 00:29:05.738
"I wonder if Rose could explain
the distinction between automation--"

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:08.464
Rose, can you explain
the distinction between automation

00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:12.702
and actual artificial intelligence?

00:29:14.883 --> 00:29:16.150
<v Rose> Perfect.

00:29:16.593 --> 00:29:21.969
Oh, we had another question, but yes.

00:29:22.986 --> 00:29:28.717
Hi, Ricky.
That's a good question, actually.

00:29:28.737 --> 00:29:33.667
Automation is now basically
when we use technology

00:29:33.687 --> 00:29:37.174
to make tasks happen automatically.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:41.437
Things that, normally,

00:29:41.457 --> 00:29:45.879
a person would have to repeat
over and over.

00:29:46.233 --> 00:29:50.907
For example,
just think of it like scheduling emails,

00:29:51.007 --> 00:29:57.468
and even in those chatbots
that give you preset answers.

00:29:57.488 --> 00:30:01.702
Automation follows
a fixed set of rules.

00:30:02.348 --> 00:30:05.087
If X happens, then do Y.

00:30:05.134 --> 00:30:06.616
Very structured.

00:30:08.823 --> 00:30:13.107
Now, AI goes a step further.

00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:15.791
It doesn't just follow instruction.

00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:20.494
It learns from data and patterns

00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:22.390
to make decisions,

00:30:22.442 --> 00:30:26.224
predictions,
and even generate new ideas.

00:30:26.923 --> 00:30:33.611
It's what allows a system
to adapt or think in a limited way,

00:30:33.742 --> 00:30:34.678
of course,

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:40.020
Instead of if X, then Y,

00:30:40.232 --> 00:30:43.973
it's more like given
what you've seen before,

00:30:43.993 --> 00:30:48.339
what's the best possible outcome
right now?

00:30:50.104 --> 00:30:51.468
<v Alicia> I get it.

00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:52.723
Wow.

00:30:57.718 --> 00:31:00.774
You were giving some examples
in your presentation.

00:31:01.295 --> 00:31:04.915
If someone were just
to get started with this,

00:31:07.052 --> 00:31:10.498
how much knowledge
do they need to know about AI?

00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:11.752
Can someone get started

00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:15.006
when they just haven't
even been exposed to AI yet?

00:31:19.173 --> 00:31:22.887
<v Rose> I feel like this is something

00:31:22.907 --> 00:31:27.778
that you don't need to have
too much knowledge about AI.

00:31:27.798 --> 00:31:32.473
Just an idea of how AI now works,

00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:38.500
and at some level of
just like you've already experienced it,

00:31:38.587 --> 00:31:41.188
then it makes it easier
for you to understand

00:31:41.208 --> 00:31:43.706
how this whole thing works.

00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:45.774
<v Alicia> You just have to get
your hands dirty

00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:47.567
and get in there and do it,

00:31:47.674 --> 00:31:50.965
and then teach AI how you think.

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:53.871
There was another question, too,

00:31:53.892 --> 00:31:58.892
and it was more like
of a resource question.

00:31:59.077 --> 00:32:00.523
It was from Gerson,

00:32:00.724 --> 00:32:02.793
and they want to know--

00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:04.397
I'm sorry, it was Sally.

00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:05.683
She wanted to know

00:32:05.704 --> 00:32:07.750
where she could learn more
about ARIA.

00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:12.670
Someone responded,
but did you have some resources also,

00:32:12.696 --> 00:32:13.774
Rose?

00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:17.576
<v Rose> For ARIA?
I actually love that question

00:32:17.596 --> 00:32:21.952
because this is something
I have actually talked before about.

00:32:23.282 --> 00:32:28.209
ARIA is
Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

00:32:28.278 --> 00:32:31.625
It's basically a set of attributes

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:35.149
you can add to your HTML

00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:39.209
to make web content
more understandable

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.102
for screen readers
and assistive technology.

00:32:43.873 --> 00:32:46.788
Now, as for where to learn,

00:32:47.376 --> 00:32:51.442
I always recommend
starting small and practical.

00:32:51.758 --> 00:32:53.509
The best resource,

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:55.876
hands down, is the official

00:32:56.839 --> 00:33:02.900
W3C web accessibility.

00:33:05.372 --> 00:33:06.407
ARIA--

00:33:08.776 --> 00:33:10.753
let me find it, just a minute.

00:33:10.896 --> 00:33:12.043
I think even--

00:33:12.579 --> 00:33:16.252
<v Alicia> You have plenty of time.</v>
<v Rose> Yes, it's the one that is there.</v>

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:20.982
It breaks down how to use ARIA roles,

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.123
states, and properties correctly.

00:33:24.398 --> 00:33:31.184
It gives real examples
like menus, models, and tabs

00:33:31.204 --> 00:33:32.686
that you can try out.

00:33:32.972 --> 00:33:36.584
If you want something
a little bit more friendly

00:33:36.604 --> 00:33:38.600
and hands-on,

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.631
let me just send them in the chat.

00:33:41.815 --> 00:33:42.815
<v Alicia> Okay.

00:33:43.001 --> 00:33:44.001
<v Rose> I have three.

00:33:44.615 --> 00:33:48.540
Honestly,
one of the best ways to learn ARIA,

00:33:48.604 --> 00:33:50.708
to experiment,

00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:55.093
are the ones that
I'm going to share right now.

00:33:55.118 --> 00:34:00.609
Just take a simple component
like a dropdown or a button,

00:34:00.877 --> 00:34:02.465
add ARIA attributes.

00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:08.974
Then test it using a screen reader,
like NVDA and VoiceOver and things like it, right.

00:34:09.054 --> 00:34:12.821
Then you start to see
how it speaks to the users,

00:34:12.848 --> 00:34:14.969
which is pretty cool.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.909
Let me share them.

00:34:20.447 --> 00:34:21.340
<v Alicia> Awesome.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.004
We're going to get some more resources
from Rose on ARIA.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.986
Let me see if anyone--

00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:39.942
Rose, do you know
that your screen has gone dark again?

00:34:40.444 --> 00:34:42.391
I'm not sure if you meant to do that.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:45.988
Okay.

00:34:46.008 --> 00:34:48.415
Did you put those resources
in the chat?

00:34:48.495 --> 00:34:50.021
Is that what you're doing?

00:34:51.961 --> 00:34:54.376
You're on mute now, too.

00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:56.851
<v Rose> Sorry.

00:34:56.974 --> 00:34:57.974
I'm doing it now.

00:34:57.994 --> 00:34:59.624
Just give me a moment.

00:34:59.676 --> 00:35:00.886
<v Alicia> Okay.

00:35:02.198 --> 00:35:06.694
Yes, you had a nice, tidy presentation

00:35:06.786 --> 00:35:10.239
to give yourself a lot of time
for questions.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.054
Then we do have
another question here, too,

00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.599
once you get the resource.

00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:30.449
Oh, I like it, too.

00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:35.906
Oh, cool. I see them coming in.

00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:37.488
All right, folks,

00:35:37.509 --> 00:35:40.408
Rose is adding some resources
to the chat,

00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:42.975
so make sure you save the chat.

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:45.749
She's got some of her ARIA resources.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.562
I'm going to actually get that myself.

00:35:48.302 --> 00:35:49.996
You click the three dots.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.952
Next to the file, the emoji,
and there's three micro dots.

00:35:54.972 --> 00:35:56.873
You click that,
and you can save the chat.

00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.697
Then you'll have anything
that was in the chat.

00:35:59.717 --> 00:36:05.246
Any links will go into a Zoom folder
on your computer.

00:36:05.707 --> 00:36:07.055
All right.

00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:11.767
Are you ready to answer
the next question, Rose?

00:36:12.752 --> 00:36:14.531
<v Rose> Okay.
I think we can proceed.

00:36:14.812 --> 00:36:16.355
<v Alicia> Okay. Awesome.

00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:20.757
This is another question from Kwaku.

00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:23.519
It's, "How can AI be used

00:36:23.539 --> 00:36:27.704
to improve accessibility
or be an ally for accessibility,

00:36:27.727 --> 00:36:32.590
and how reliable are current
AI-driven accessibility checkers?"

00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:38.633
<v Rose> Good question, Kwaku.

00:36:38.676 --> 00:36:45.636
I like thinking of AI
as an accessibility ally,

00:36:45.876 --> 00:36:50.352
not a replacement
for human understanding,

00:36:50.814 --> 00:36:56.187
but a helper that can make
inclusion easier, faster,

00:36:56.207 --> 00:36:59.421
and more consistent.

00:36:59.583 --> 00:37:01.607
These questions are--

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:05.376
let me just send this here.

00:37:07.874 --> 00:37:09.497
I think we can start with

00:37:09.544 --> 00:37:12.364
how AI can actually improve
accessibility.

00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:16.964
There are so many exciting ways
that this is happening right now.

00:37:17.224 --> 00:37:20.775
For example,
with image recognition tools,

00:37:22.085 --> 00:37:25.913
they can automatically generate
alt text for people

00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:28.922
who are blind or have low vision.

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:33.072
Tools like Microsoft Seeing AI,

00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:39.045
or the AI-powered
alt text feature in WordPress,

00:37:39.067 --> 00:37:40.140
I believe,

00:37:40.296 --> 00:37:42.596
and social media platforms

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.070
try to describe
what's in the picture.

00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:52.012
The other example
is speech recognition,

00:37:52.032 --> 00:37:54.762
and then there's also
real-time captioning,

00:37:54.782 --> 00:37:59.125
and AI translators
can turn live speeches

00:37:59.145 --> 00:38:05.297
like this one into text
or even translate it on the spot,

00:38:05.317 --> 00:38:09.085
right in the moment,
which is a huge help for people

00:38:09.105 --> 00:38:14.242
who are deaf, hard of hearing,
or who don't speak the same language.

00:38:16.513 --> 00:38:20.467
There's also the predictive text,

00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:23.898
or it's called smart writing assistant,

00:38:24.005 --> 00:38:28.699
which can now support
neurodivergent users

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.585
by helping them express
their thoughts more easily.

00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:39.470
Yes, AI can definitely be an ally
when it's used thoughtfully.

00:38:40.082 --> 00:38:44.003
Now, on the second part
of your question,

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:47.175
how reliable, let me see.

00:38:50.755 --> 00:38:51.895
<v Alicia> Where did it go?

00:38:51.992 --> 00:38:54.492
Oh, I think I've already put it
in the answer.

00:38:54.923 --> 00:38:56.736
<v Rose> Oh, okay.</v>
<v Alicia> The second one was

00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.386
how reliable are the current
AI-driven accessibility checkers?

00:39:01.687 --> 00:39:02.455
The reliability of those.

00:39:02.476 --> 00:39:05.169
<v Rose> I'll be honest
with this question.

00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:08.618
They are helpful, but not so perfect.

00:39:08.889 --> 00:39:12.621
AI tools can actually catch
obvious issues

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:17.089
like missing alt text,

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:19.125
color contrast problems,

00:39:19.145 --> 00:39:22.988
or even headings
that are out of order.

00:39:23.641 --> 00:39:26.902
Tools like Axe,
like I mentioned, WAVE,

00:39:26.923 --> 00:39:31.426
and Accessibility Insights
are good for that,

00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:35.447
but AI still struggles with context.

00:39:37.874 --> 00:39:43.629
For example, if an image is described
a person smiling, that's fine.

00:39:43.954 --> 00:39:47.776
If it's part of a blog post

00:39:48.034 --> 00:39:51.409
about climate protest,

00:39:51.992 --> 00:39:55.178
that description totally
misses the point.

00:39:55.505 --> 00:39:59.987
AI [doesn't] always understand meaning.

00:40:00.363 --> 00:40:04.479
Now accessibility is deeply
about the meaning and context.

00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:11.402
I'd say AI accessibility tools
are amazing starting points,

00:40:11.524 --> 00:40:13.879
but not the end points.

00:40:13.982 --> 00:40:16.227
They make the work faster,

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:21.443
but they still need us as humans
with empathy to check for accuracy,

00:40:21.463 --> 00:40:22.803
like I said before.

00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:25.012
Relevance, and tone as well.

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.851
Think of it in this way.

00:40:29.107 --> 00:40:34.215
AI can open the door,
but it's up to us as humans

00:40:34.402 --> 00:40:40.767
to make sure that everyone actually gets
to walk through it easily and safely.

00:40:42.035 --> 00:40:45.545
<v Alicia> Yes, I feel like it's--
I'm so sorry,

00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:47.183
I have a cat here.

00:40:47.526 --> 00:40:50.295
I feel like it's a rough draft.

00:40:50.745 --> 00:40:52.565
You cannot take it as a [?].

00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:54.593
It gives you a head start.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.557
That's what AI does.

00:40:57.427 --> 00:40:59.400
I appreciate the head start, too.

00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:00.517
Very helpful.

00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:06.269
There's been other presentations about
how it just increases your efficiency

00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:08.305
and get more done,

00:41:08.407 --> 00:41:12.803
and you can leverage it
rather than be afraid of it,

00:41:12.823 --> 00:41:15.355
or to wholeheartedly depend on it.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.963
So that's cool.

00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:20.950
Anyone else would like
to put questions into the Q&amp;A?

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.510
You're perfectly welcome to do so.

00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:27.685
<v Rose> Can I continue
to share the resources?

00:41:28.011 --> 00:41:29.924
<v Alicia> Yes. </v>
<v Rose> Are there more questions? </v>

00:41:31.397 --> 00:41:33.622
<v Alicia> Oh, did you say
you had something to share?

00:41:34.895 --> 00:41:37.253
<v Rose> Oh, yes, the resources that
I was supposed to share,

00:41:37.273 --> 00:41:39.513
and then I said I'll share them later.

00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:42.481
I think I can share them right now.

00:41:42.716 --> 00:41:45.171
<v Alicia> Yes, if you want to put links
or anything into the chat,

00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:50.608
go ahead and do that,
because you have the time to do that.

00:41:51.278 --> 00:41:55.960
We can keep going too, or we can also,
if anyone--

00:41:56.627 --> 00:41:57.627
I mean,

00:41:59.318 --> 00:42:04.035
I really am impressed with--

00:42:05.462 --> 00:42:08.286
when I'm finding out all these people
are from different countries

00:42:08.312 --> 00:42:11.886
and they're doing accessibility
in their own country,

00:42:12.092 --> 00:42:15.951
I'm really interested, and like I said,
I'm impressed, too,

00:42:16.114 --> 00:42:22.432
of how prevalent it is in Kenya
that people care about accessibility.

00:42:25.566 --> 00:42:27.360
How is it over there?

00:42:29.874 --> 00:42:33.122
<v Rose> Oh, yes. I was trying
to look for the resources.

00:42:34.022 --> 00:42:40.531
In Kenya,
accessibility is not so common.

00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:44.155
People usually treat it
as an afterthought.

00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:50.298
That is why I'm always
championing for accessibility.

00:42:51.036 --> 00:42:55.226
For every person that I meet in Kenya,
they know tech,

00:42:55.246 --> 00:42:57.085
they're interested in tech.

00:42:57.187 --> 00:42:59.944
I just let them know that
there's something called accessibility,

00:42:59.964 --> 00:43:01.035
because there's even people

00:43:01.055 --> 00:43:04.984
who have never heard of it,
and they're actually developers.

00:43:07.836 --> 00:43:10.291
I'd say we are still on the journey to,

00:43:10.774 --> 00:43:14.770
first of all,
even get the idea of accessibility.

00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:20.458
I believe we'll be there with time.

00:43:20.716 --> 00:43:22.561
Also, if people are open,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:29.813
they're open to learning such things.

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:33.987
Accessibility here in Kenya,
I wouldn't say

00:43:34.007 --> 00:43:40.014
it's widely known for developers,
or even content creators,

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:43.296
or even product managers.

00:43:44.524 --> 00:43:48.698
Of course, there are people
who are still preaching accessibility,

00:43:48.769 --> 00:43:50.253
accessibility,

00:43:50.493 --> 00:43:52.928
but I believe it takes time

00:43:53.025 --> 00:43:57.503
for such things to get used to people.

00:43:58.233 --> 00:44:01.548
<v Alicia> I am glad you're one
of the people over there doing that.

00:44:01.676 --> 00:44:04.762
Appreciate that.
Now you're telling the whole world.

00:44:04.783 --> 00:44:07.621
Okay. What we're going to do is
we're going to wrap up.

00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:10.727
I really, really thank you
for this presentation.

00:44:17.258 --> 00:44:19.078
Rose, thank you once again.
