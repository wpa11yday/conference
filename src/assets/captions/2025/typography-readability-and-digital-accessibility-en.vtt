>> JESSICA SAMS: Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.237
My name is Jessica Sams.

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:43.077
I'm a virtual public engagement specialist
and UX Designer

00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:47.151
for SWCA Environmental Consultants.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.485
Thank you for joining us.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.847
For Typography, Readability,
and Digital Accessibility

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:55.619
with Giulia Laco.

00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.598
Hooked on web design since the early days,
she comes from a background

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:04.018
in the humanities, logic, and linguistics.

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.037
In her career,

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.118
Giulia has crafted
digital experiences for businesses,

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:12.951
professionals, and e-commerce sites
with optimization in mind.

00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:20.361
Her expertise spans semantic HTML, SEO,
UX, and beyond.

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:25.197
She's passionate
about how typography shapes the web,

00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:29.572
digging into web font choices,
and CSS, and readability.

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:34.078
She works as a consultant
and trainer for specialized courses

00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:37.642
and occasionally takes
the stage at industry events.

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:43.317
She's drawn to where disciplines meet
and loves switching between theory

00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:44.962
and hands-on practice.

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:51.597

with other attendees.

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:02.127
>> GIULIA LACO: Hello, everyone.

00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:04.258
Greetings from Italy.

00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:06.226
Welcome to my session.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:14.947
Okay. Now, I'm really happy and
proud to be part of this 24-hour event.

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:21.067
I would like to thank WordPress
Accessibility Day team

00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:26.921
to organize this event and having me

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.932
talk about one of my favorite topics,

00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:32.818
that's web typography,

00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:35.632
readability, and digital accessibility.

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:39.628
There are many intersections
between the three,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:44.031
and that's exactly
what we are going to explore today,

00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:47.842
if you're patient enough
to follow me through.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.267
A few words about me.

00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:58.495
Well, I'm a web designer

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.510
and developer who started out
in the mid-90s

00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:04.852
at the very beginning of the web.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.032
Over the years, I've seen

00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:11.103
quite a lot of evolution,

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:16.026
and I think it's still valid

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.802
what was meant at the beginning.

00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.928
The core principles

00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:25.588
the web was built on remain valid today.

00:04:25.612 --> 00:04:30.622
The web was born accessible,
and that was a brilliant idea.

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:38.607
On top of being a web designer
and developer during these,

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:42.262
I'm also a consultant now and trainer

00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:50.722
on the main topics I know, at least,

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:56.427
CSS, web typography,
web fonts, semantic HTML,

00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:58.041
and the like.

00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:03.561
Let's dig into the topic of today.

00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:09.082
I start with how reading works.

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.241
Well, in particular,

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.502
I will focus on visual reading.

00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:17.661
What is visual reading?

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:25.232
Well, it's a process of engaging
with the written text in order

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:30.081
to grasp some meanings and information
from the text.

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:35.361
Maybe visual reading is not
the only form of reading.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.052
Some people, for instance, may use

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:43.437
the sense of touch
and read some Braille text,

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:44.991
or some other

00:05:45.622 --> 00:05:51.927
can access content with a screen reader,

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.811
so through the sense of hearing.

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:56.872
What is peculiar

00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.511
about reading, in my opinion,

00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:04.857
is the active engagement we put
into grasping information,

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.658
extracting meaning from a piece of text.

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:16.317
I've prepared
a list of the main factors that,

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.282
in my opinion, influence visual reading.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.987
Before starting
this overview, well, talking

00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.848
about the reading experience,

00:06:26.872 --> 00:06:30.395
what could be better than a novel?

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:36.148
I've picked
one of Italo Calvino's latest novels,

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:39.096
If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.367
Italo Calvino was
an Italian writer whose works

00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:47.985
have been translated into many languages.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.762
Here are some random book covers.

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.656
I would like to read you
a few opening lines

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.407
in the translation by William Weaver,

00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.431
because I think
it's relevant to the topic.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.230
It begins like this.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:10.678
"You are about to begin
reading Italo Calvino's new novel,

00:07:10.702 --> 00:07:13.101
If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:15.598
Relax.

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:17.038
Concentrate.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.131
Dispel every other thought.

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:22.768
Let the world around you fade."

00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.658
Can you hear it?

00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:31.522
It's quite an exact language the author
is using to describe the right moment,

00:07:32.362 --> 00:07:36.172
the exact moment
in which one starts reading

00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:37.978
and says relax.

00:07:38.002 --> 00:07:41.458
It means a physical condition.

00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:44.991
Concentrate, something you have
to do in the mind.

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:50.458
Dispel every other thought,
push away other thoughts,

00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:54.172
and then let the world around you fade.

00:07:54.831 --> 00:08:00.252
Let the world around you go into,

00:08:00.276 --> 00:08:03.178
let's say, out of focus. Blur it.

00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:04.202
Blur it.

00:08:04.972 --> 00:08:07.851
That's exactly what happens while reading.

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.471
In my list of factors
that influence visual reading,

00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:23.277
I've organized the items
in three main areas.

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:25.588
Let's say we have common factors,

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:27.231
common to everybody,

00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:32.182
we have personal conditions
because everybody is different,

00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:35.008
and typographic properties

00:08:35.032 --> 00:08:38.692
that link to the text,
the text we are going to read.

00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:42.651
Among the common factors,

00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:47.062
I would say there are,
are connected to the situation,

00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:51.778
such as the reading distance
or the reading support.

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:56.152
Is it on paper or is it on screen?

00:08:57.562 --> 00:08:59.331
The light, the ambient lighting,

00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:02.332
and if it's digital,
the screen brightness,

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:05.482
or the noise, the environment noise.

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.931
There are some other factors

00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:15.003
that are linked to the reader's attitude,
such as mental focus,

00:09:15.027 --> 00:09:16.027
even mood.

00:09:17.062 --> 00:09:18.062
Of course,

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:22.317
the type of text we are going
to read is relevant.

00:09:22.341 --> 00:09:25.858
Is it a title, a long form reading,

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:28.575
a voice in a menu?

00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:36.555
Among personal conditions, well, the first

00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:44.925
of all, in my opinion, is age,

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:48.207
because everybody has an age,

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:56.057
whether it's a child who is learning
to read or an adult getting older

00:09:56.081 --> 00:09:57.612
and progressively decreasing

00:09:58.332 --> 00:09:59.622
his or her abilities.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.831
Then we have

00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:07.128
competence in reading is relevant.

00:10:07.152 --> 00:10:10.722
The more I have read,
the more proficient I have become.

00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:15.828
The same goes for the language competence.

00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:19.070
Is it my first language, second language?

00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:20.094
That's different.

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:27.438
The interest
in the topic I'm reading is also relevant,

00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:28.991
and the motivation I have.

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:34.256
Then, of course, visual impairments,
there are so many,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.721
so different memory issues,

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:45.191
dyslexia, ADHD, ASD,
epilepsy, neurodivergences,

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:49.121
and even migraine, anxiety, fatigue,

00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:51.041
and maybe some more.

00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:59.778
In the third group, I put
the typographic properties of the text.

00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:03.018
They influence reading.
The first of the list,

00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:06.432
of course, is the typeface
in which the text is written.

00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:10.097
I think it's the most important.

00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:17.801
Then we have the color contrast
of the text over the background.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.228
Then the style of the font.

00:11:21.252 --> 00:11:23.674
Is it bold?
Is it italic?

00:11:24.762 --> 00:11:30.220
The font dimension, of course,
and the paragraph length,

00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:32.867
and spaces,

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:37.271
spaces between lines,
between characters, between words.

00:11:38.501 --> 00:11:40.751
Even the character width is important.

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.308
Some others,

00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.947
and last but not least,

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:52.998
I would say rhythm
that I suspect is very relevant to fluency

00:11:53.022 --> 00:11:54.022
in reading.

00:11:57.552 --> 00:12:04.692
Let's look at the characteristics
of visual reading.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.449
I'll give you a general idea
of what visual science seems

00:12:09.473 --> 00:12:12.059
to be telling us,
as far as I've understood.

00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:17.009
Please forgive my language, maybe.

00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:23.982
That might not be so much scientific,
but let's have a look of the process.

00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:27.557
Let's say we start with fixations.

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.692
What are fixations?

00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:36.287
Like pauses between eye movements,
the fixation goes on a bunch of letters

00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:37.451
in a line of text,

00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:45.342
and it tends to last, I don't know,
a quarter of a second.

00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.350
And then

00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:53.708
a second, a very quick movement,
eye movement happens,

00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:58.392
and then another fixation

00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:02.807
over a bunch of other letters.

00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:06.138
We don't properly read each letter.

00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:07.599
We jump.

00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:15.461
This happens on a horizontal direction
in our writing system,

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.552
but also in a vertical direction.

00:13:19.422 --> 00:13:22.961
We need to focus
on the current line of text,

00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:27.972
and maybe put
the other lines out of focus.

00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:34.457
We alternate fixations
and saccades on the first line.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:38.838
When we reach the end of a line,
we perform a return movement

00:13:38.862 --> 00:13:41.395
to the beginning of the next line,
if we find

00:13:42.126 --> 00:13:47.322
the exact place
where the next line starts.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:56.538
It's common experience for visual readers
that anytime we are in doubt

00:13:56.562 --> 00:13:58.607
about not having read properly,

00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:01.661
we go back to re-read
previously encountered text,

00:14:02.412 --> 00:14:04.301
and that's called regression.

00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:09.857
The fixation,

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:15.011
each fixation, has
a maximum acuity in the center,

00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:18.677
and the letters around that point

00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:21.052
appear progressively blurred.

00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:27.557
We said foveal acuity.

00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:30.372
Fovea comes from fovea,

00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:35.777
which contains the highest concentration
of light receptors.

00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:40.211
Fovea is the tiny central part of macula.

00:14:40.872 --> 00:14:41.922
Both are

00:14:43.602 --> 00:14:46.001
the center of the retina,

00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:49.182
the light-sensitive layer

00:14:50.442 --> 00:14:55.812
at the rear part,
at the back part of the eye,

00:14:56.441 --> 00:14:59.803
that captures light and sends information

00:15:01.723 --> 00:15:05.382
of what it has captured to the brain.

00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:11.831
Then we have this focus mechanism.

00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:16.847
The eye works like a camera
that can change focus from near objects

00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:17.892
to far objects.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.101
And what fascinates me about this

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:26.808
is that it involves intentionality,
so we intentionally focus

00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:29.897
on something interesting.

00:15:33.042 --> 00:15:35.208
The fovea collects an image,

00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:40.421
maybe an inverted image
because of how lenses work,

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:47.207
and maybe
it's not one character per fixation,

00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:53.268
but a bunch of characters,
the number of which depends

00:15:53.292 --> 00:15:54.821
on the reading distance

00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:57.251
and on the font size.

00:15:58.571 --> 00:15:59.688
A well-known typographer,

00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:01.218
Bruno Maag,

00:16:01.242 --> 00:16:05.477
has made a lot of calculations on this.

00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:09.012
The ideal number of characters
in a fixation are

00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:12.432
from seven to nine, according to him.

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:16.571
That's a very brilliant calculation.

00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:24.978
Let's continue to understand
the process of visual reading.

00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:26.682
After the physical part,

00:16:27.971 --> 00:16:31.931
we go through some mental processes.

00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:38.141
Those data are sent to the brain.

00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:44.688
What happens there, I'm not so sure about,
but I'll show you this diagram

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:46.241
by Sofie Beier,

00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:49.031
a real expert on how reading works.

00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:56.268
It's very complex
to study and to describe,

00:16:56.292 --> 00:17:03.498
but what I'd like to stress
and what catches my attention is

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:08.718
that it shows
a parallel process of letter recognition

00:17:08.742 --> 00:17:10.482
and word recognition.

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:17.741
As long as we try to detect letters,

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:21.671
we use our knowledge about word

00:17:22.572 --> 00:17:24.558
to speed up the process

00:17:24.582 --> 00:17:28.152
and determine which word is most probable.

00:17:30.882 --> 00:17:34.518
And this, that's amazing,

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:41.891
this may explain why lowercase text
is easier to read than all caps.

00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:51.942
This is because we memorize, maybe,
we memorize the shape of words,

00:17:52.691 --> 00:17:54.528
like ideograms.

00:17:54.552 --> 00:17:58.578
We perform some sort of shape recognition
when we read,

00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:01.872
and this speeds up our reading.

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:09.108
Another interesting thing
about mental processing while

00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:13.188
reading is this, in my opinion,

00:18:13.212 --> 00:18:15.581
the typeface exposure.

00:18:16.182 --> 00:18:22.092
Well, that's a theory by Zuzana Licko,
a famous type designer

00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:25.181
that once said,

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:30.671
or wrote, "Readers read best
what they read most."

00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:33.798
Let's see if it's true.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:37.122
This is set in Helvetica, quite common.

00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:41.472
This is in Georgia, common as well.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:43.578
In Garamond,

00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:45.792
like most books are written.

00:18:46.512 --> 00:18:47.958
In Verdana,

00:18:47.982 --> 00:18:49.421
like the first web,

00:18:50.082 --> 00:18:52.811
or Montserrat, the web of today.

00:18:55.032 --> 00:18:56.807
Wait a minute, what is this?

00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:59.328
This is quite illegible, isn't it?

00:18:59.352 --> 00:19:01.812
That's totally gothic.

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:07.781
The exact typeface used
by Zuzana Licko in her original quote

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:09.971
to prove her point.

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.257
It's not so common.

00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:15.647
It's not so easy to read
because it's not so common.

00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.141
We haven't read it enough.

00:19:20.082 --> 00:19:25.127
This brings us to dig more

00:19:25.151 --> 00:19:29.118
into some concepts,
the concepts of legibility

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:30.350
and readability.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:36.078
They have some shades of meaning
that I will explain later on.

00:19:36.102 --> 00:19:42.317
First, let's take a step back
and consider the concept of visibility,

00:19:42.341 --> 00:19:46.882
because if we don't see,
we can't visually read.

00:19:48.982 --> 00:19:51.322
Visibility, let's say,

00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:56.950
is the ease of seeing,
of perceiving the text.

00:19:58.012 --> 00:20:00.022
It might answer us to the question,

00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:03.576
can you see it?
Can you see?

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.182
It's based on two pillars,
color contrast and font size.

00:20:10.593 --> 00:20:13.521
Color contrast of text, the background.

00:20:15.862 --> 00:20:18.327
Let's make an example.

00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:23.332
Black text on white is high contrast text,

00:20:24.562 --> 00:20:26.752
and pale gray and white

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.067
is a low contrast,

00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:32.872
not visible, not distinguishable text
from background.

00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:41.757
This inevitably reminds us
of the success criteria of color contrast

00:20:41.781 --> 00:20:45.703
in the WCAG,
the guideline of distinguishable,

00:20:47.001 --> 00:20:52.122
that says that we have
some recommended contrast ratio.

00:20:53.841 --> 00:20:55.965
The nice thing here, in my opinion,

00:20:55.989 --> 00:21:00.677
is that this contrast ratio is put in relation

00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:04.823
to the font size

00:21:05.862 --> 00:21:11.643
and the boldness of the font.

00:21:17.212 --> 00:21:25.168
We, as designers, we need to know

00:21:25.192 --> 00:21:26.602
where we can use

00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:32.811
a wider range of contrast ratio,
a wider range of colors,

00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:36.381
so we should know

00:21:38.272 --> 00:21:40.341
what large-scale text is.

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:47.008
From the definition in the WCAG,
there are some other things interesting,

00:21:47.032 --> 00:21:50.007
in my opinion, and that's this.

00:21:50.031 --> 00:21:53.007
The note number one in that definition,

00:21:53.031 --> 00:21:58.078
that says fonts
with extraordinarily thin strokes

00:21:58.102 --> 00:22:03.577
or unusual features
and characteristics that reduce

00:22:03.601 --> 00:22:07.347
the familiarity of their letter forms
are harder to read,

00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:10.120
especially at lower contrast levels.

00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:15.808
I made some examples.

00:22:15.832 --> 00:22:17.062
I took Broadway,

00:22:17.721 --> 00:22:21.712
a high-contrast web font,

00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:27.538
meaning that it has very thin strokes
compared to very large strokes.

00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:33.987
The very thin strokes
are not quite visible when the font is set

00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:37.221
small and on a lower contrast,

00:22:37.912 --> 00:22:41.037
pale gray and white.

00:22:41.061 --> 00:22:49.138
The same happens with unusual fonts,
fonts that have unusual features

00:22:49.162 --> 00:22:54.238
and characteristics that reduce
the familiarity of the letter forms.

00:22:54.262 --> 00:22:57.237
Remember Zuzana Licko.

00:22:58.341 --> 00:23:03.046
I compared those two examples of Broadway,
totally gothic with Verdana,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.792
that was built

00:23:06.142 --> 00:23:09.681
to be readable on screens,

00:23:10.521 --> 00:23:15.472
and so you might see
the difference and judge.

00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:18.921
The nice thing of this

00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:28.828
from the large text definition,
is that color contrast in relation

00:23:28.852 --> 00:23:35.578
with font size, font weight,
boldness, very thin strokes

00:23:35.602 --> 00:23:37.191
and unfamiliar letter forms.

00:23:39.321 --> 00:23:42.891
What about the font size,
the second pillar of visibility?

00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:47.721
Well, can we trust font size?

00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:50.751
Not entirely,

00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:59.278
because if you set
two different fonts at the same size,

00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:02.541
the same nominal size,
let's say 16 pixels,

00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:08.637
you end up with very different perceptions.

00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:12.891
Fonts are different in size, in perceived size.

00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:17.907
That's because of history,

00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:20.602
it's a legacy from the metatype era.

00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:23.487
With regards to accessibility,

00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:25.947
this makes harder
to define a clear boundary

00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:30.502
between normal and large text,
because we don't have

00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:33.807
a proper nominal size.

00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:35.337
We have to judge,

00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:39.477
the designer's eye must have
the last word on this,

00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:41.792
not the numbers.

00:24:46.053 --> 00:24:51.118
Talking about font size, I will quote

00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:57.914
another success criteria from the WCAG, the 1.4.4,

00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:01.184
the resize text one,

00:25:03.592 --> 00:25:09.898
that says that text should be set in a way
that it could be resized up to 200%

00:25:09.922 --> 00:25:14.032
without loss of content or functionality.

00:25:16.672 --> 00:25:22.041
The interesting thing here is
that this view must be seen in relation

00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:26.992
with the user agent accessibility guideline,

00:25:27.832 --> 00:25:32.811
so the one thought for browsers and--

00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:37.972
Let's see, what does this mean in practice?

00:25:39.472 --> 00:25:40.557
Nowadays,

00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:45.232
there are at least two ways
to zoom the text on a web page.

00:25:46.132 --> 00:25:48.868
Zooming from the view menu,

00:25:48.892 --> 00:25:51.892
or hitting control plus, command plus,

00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:57.951
and making — zooming —

00:25:59.602 --> 00:26:00.621
making text zoom

00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:06.447
by browser preferences,

00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:12.022
setting the character dimension,
generally among a few predefined choices.

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.361
These two methods of zooming
are very different.

00:26:19.702 --> 00:26:21.172
What happens under

00:26:21.892 --> 00:26:23.397
the box,

00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:27.297
under the surface, is
that the first one changes

00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:31.731
the reference pixel of--
It's something that happens in the device,

00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:35.031
whereas the second one

00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:39.268
changes the size of the root font,

00:26:39.292 --> 00:26:44.151
and that's upon our responsibilities
as web developers.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:48.921
Just a warning,

00:26:50.422 --> 00:26:52.642
setting font size in pixels

00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:56.007
blocks user preferences,

00:26:56.031 --> 00:27:00.112
so never use fixed

00:27:01.492 --> 00:27:04.435
units for font size.

00:27:06.388 --> 00:27:14.173
Trust the device,

00:27:14.197 --> 00:27:16.047
the information

00:27:16.071 --> 00:27:18.676
in the device, the default of the device,

00:27:20.722 --> 00:27:22.819
and as a web developer,

00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:33.597
don't be mean and just don't block users
from using their own browser settings

00:27:33.621 --> 00:27:34.621
or extensions.

00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:38.062
Don't use fixed units for fonts.

00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:43.102
Okay, now we go to,

00:27:45.261 --> 00:27:48.447
after visibility,
we'll talk about legibility.

00:27:48.471 --> 00:27:50.047
Legibility

00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:54.331
is an English word that comes
from Latin, from lego, legere,

00:27:54.355 --> 00:27:56.865
that means reading.

00:27:59.032 --> 00:28:05.986
It's generally addressed in typography
as a bit different from readability,

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:13.573
and it's meant to mean ease
of deciphering,

00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:17.758
decoding the letters.

00:28:17.782 --> 00:28:20.334
Can you read it?
Can you read this text?

00:28:21.045 --> 00:28:24.352
That's the question it answered.

00:28:27.231 --> 00:28:31.018
When we start looking to type
legibility, in my opinion,

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:34.432
it's important to get familiar
with some basic typographic terms.

00:28:35.062 --> 00:28:41.097
Knowing the anatomy of type help us notice
the subtle details in each typeface

00:28:41.121 --> 00:28:43.462
and evaluate how legible it is.

00:28:44.601 --> 00:28:45.601
For example,

00:28:46.521 --> 00:28:53.992
we should understand
what a serif is, what an axis is,

00:28:54.832 --> 00:29:03.087
what an aperture, the baseline,
the x-height of a typeface,

00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:04.827
or the descendant,

00:29:04.851 --> 00:29:05.962
the ascendant,

00:29:06.861 --> 00:29:08.338
the font size,

00:29:08.362 --> 00:29:11.151
the nominal font size,
that it's different, that it'll be so,

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:17.188
from the perceived font size,
the visible height,

00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:18.246
and so on.

00:29:20.001 --> 00:29:23.937
I will talk in particular about apertures.

00:29:25.732 --> 00:29:27.628
What are apertures?

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:38.182
Are the open and closed paths of letters.

00:29:38.841 --> 00:29:43.132
For example, in lowercase c
or lowercase e,

00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:50.118
we have this opening of the circle,
and if it's short,

00:29:50.142 --> 00:29:51.502
if it's narrow,

00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:56.442
when the font is typed small,

00:29:57.082 --> 00:30:05.241
it can be taken for an O,
so that typeface with narrow apertures

00:30:05.892 --> 00:30:08.001
is going to be less legible,

00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.403
for example, for body type,
when set small.

00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:18.504
That's correct, not every font has

00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:21.078
the same apertures,

00:30:21.102 --> 00:30:27.270
and so not every font
has the same legibility.

00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:31.007
On top of apertures,

00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:34.771
I will talk about the distance
between letters.

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:40.698
I'm not referring to kerning,
that's something backed

00:30:40.722 --> 00:30:44.372
into the font file,

00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:55.078
but I'm talking about what we call
in CSS the letter spacing.

00:30:56.218 --> 00:30:58.668
I have a little challenge for you now.

00:30:58.692 --> 00:31:01.277
I've studied a series of repeated words

00:31:01.301 --> 00:31:04.691
with a very tiny spacing between letters.

00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:09.492
Can somebody spot my little joke?

00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:12.312
Well, here it is.

00:31:13.302 --> 00:31:15.948
I played with ambiguous characters.

00:31:15.972 --> 00:31:18.917
In one of the repetitions,
instead of uppercase S,

00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:21.377
I put a number five.

00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:23.821
They're very similar in this typeface.

00:31:24.942 --> 00:31:27.242
Instead of a lowercase d,

00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:31.187
I put a lowercase c
and an l, that combine,

00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:32.591
might resemble a D,

00:31:33.372 --> 00:31:34.722
but this is happening

00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:42.551
when the font is typed very narrow,

00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:45.581
each letter is very narrow to the other.

00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:52.512
If I add spacing
between letters, that's going

00:31:53.382 --> 00:31:56.017
to be different, so

00:31:57.942 --> 00:32:00.582
spacing between letters matters a lot.

00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:07.061
Of course, this deceivable couple of pairs

00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:11.987
are not in every font.

00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:17.741
Some fonts
have more ambiguous shapes than others,

00:32:18.702 --> 00:32:20.172
with this respect.

00:32:21.882 --> 00:32:26.567
We have a lot of confusable characters,
ambiguous shapes,

00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:28.008
ambiguous proportions,

00:32:28.032 --> 00:32:30.899
and, as we saw, deceptive combinations.

00:32:35.284 --> 00:32:41.177
These pairs are like this, for example,

00:32:41.201 --> 00:32:49.183
number zero versus uppercase O,
or number nine versus lowercase g.

00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:54.292
In the word 1Illinois, the first letters,

00:32:55.002 --> 00:32:58.352
they look quite the same in some fonts,

00:32:59.261 --> 00:33:04.638
or kerning
sometimes can be seen as keming,

00:33:04.662 --> 00:33:08.673
because of rn resembling to an m.

00:33:09.881 --> 00:33:14.562
Then we have confusable pairs,

00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:17.891
mirror pairs, and rotational pairs.

00:33:20.022 --> 00:33:21.197
Lowercase b,

00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:27.767
d, p, q in sans serif fonts,
well, it's quite common for them

00:33:27.791 --> 00:33:31.751
to have basically the same shape,
mirrored or rotated,

00:33:33.102 --> 00:33:36.288
so they might be difficult
to distinguish for some people.

00:33:36.312 --> 00:33:40.272
It's often said it's difficult
for some people with dyslexia.

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:44.987
It's certainly true
for kids who start writing,

00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:48.254
that they mirror letters quite often.

00:33:50.329 --> 00:33:55.007
This thing doesn't happen so frequently
with serif fonts,

00:33:55.031 --> 00:33:56.622
but it might happen as well,

00:33:57.552 --> 00:33:59.897
so choose responsibly.

00:34:02.322 --> 00:34:06.253
Another thing important in reading,
in my opinion, is rhythm.

00:34:06.882 --> 00:34:10.752
Okay, we said distance between letters
and rhythm between letters.

00:34:11.741 --> 00:34:15.524
Let's take the word minimum in lowercase.

00:34:16.332 --> 00:34:22.440
It shows a rhythmic pattern created
by the vertical strokes

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.672
of the letters and alternating openings

00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:29.541
between them.

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:36.467
Some studies seem to demonstrate
that regularism can help some people read,

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:40.170
and irregularism seems to help some others.

00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:43.200
In any case, rhythm is relevant.

00:34:45.029 --> 00:34:47.939
We need some more research on that.

00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:56.418
Then, we finally arrive to the concept of readability.

00:34:56.442 --> 00:35:01.031
Well, what is readability,
different from legibility?

00:35:02.232 --> 00:35:06.557
Readability, in my opinion,
is something that I call reading

00:35:06.581 --> 00:35:11.982
experience, and it belongs
to the wider area of user experience,

00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:14.950
but let's recap.

00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:19.061
With invisibility, the ease of seeing,

00:35:19.722 --> 00:35:23.867
answer to the question, can you see this?

00:35:23.891 --> 00:35:25.272
Whereas legibility,

00:35:26.412 --> 00:35:27.821
ease of deciphering,

00:35:28.888 --> 00:35:30.978
answer to the question, can you read this?

00:35:31.002 --> 00:35:32.671
Can you recognize the letters in it?

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:39.041
Readability is the real ease of reading,

00:35:39.642 --> 00:35:43.458
and answer to the question,
can you comfortably read this?

00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:46.152
Not only read this,
but can you comfortably do?

00:35:53.711 --> 00:35:55.931
Let's dig into readability.

00:35:56.862 --> 00:35:58.932
Readability has two meanings.

00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:02.687
One is relative to the content.

00:36:02.711 --> 00:36:04.362
The content readability

00:36:05.352 --> 00:36:08.568
is linked to the language.

00:36:08.592 --> 00:36:10.187
Can you understand what I'm saying?

00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:13.098
Is it in the language you can understand,

00:36:13.122 --> 00:36:16.481
the concept you can understand,
the level you can understand?

00:36:19.032 --> 00:36:21.551
The other kind of readability

00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:27.677
that I'm very fond of
is typographic readability.

00:36:27.701 --> 00:36:32.237
That's quite inviting the reader to read.

00:36:32.261 --> 00:36:34.302
That's why I like it so much.

00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:44.527
Content readability has
two nice WCAG success criteria

00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:45.528
linked to it.

00:36:45.552 --> 00:36:50.921
One is the 3.1.1 language of page,
must be said,

00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:54.967
and the other one is the reading level.

00:36:57.517 --> 00:37:00.462
They deal with content readability.

00:37:02.232 --> 00:37:05.082
Speaking of typographic readability,

00:37:06.522 --> 00:37:14.223
well, the history of graphic has a lot
of ads, and typographical ads

00:37:14.247 --> 00:37:22.032
for readability surely layout relations

00:37:22.842 --> 00:37:29.304
between elements,
white space, hierarchies,

00:37:29.328 --> 00:37:35.236
and with everything that gives
hierarchy and reading priority helps

00:37:35.871 --> 00:37:37.998
in typographic readability.

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:39.402
Typographic scale

00:37:40.061 --> 00:37:46.399
gives also a harmonious way
to present hierarchies,

00:37:46.423 --> 00:37:48.950
so we have a lot of tools.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.861
Of course, typesetting.

00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:57.618
Let's see some basic use of typesettings.

00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:01.367
The first

00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:06.371
that everybody knows are text alignments.

00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:14.922
We have left, center,
and right possibility to align the text.

00:38:15.941 --> 00:38:16.991
The left one,

00:38:18.011 --> 00:38:20.231
in our writing system, is the best one.

00:38:21.011 --> 00:38:22.188
Why is it?

00:38:22.212 --> 00:38:24.251
Because it's easier to read

00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:28.008
when we go to the second line,
the next line.

00:38:28.032 --> 00:38:29.868
We know where it is.

00:38:29.892 --> 00:38:34.098
We don't have to look
for the starting of the second line

00:38:34.122 --> 00:38:35.141
or the next line

00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:38.927
somewhere.

00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:48.944
That's why the left alignment
is the best for readability.

00:38:52.062 --> 00:38:56.552
Another thing, another alignment
is the justification,

00:38:56.576 --> 00:38:58.601
the justified text.

00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:04.959
Typographers are very disappointed
about narrow columns

00:39:04.983 --> 00:39:09.951
with justified because it happens

00:39:09.975 --> 00:39:16.093
that there are some spaces,

00:39:16.117 --> 00:39:19.791
uneven spaces in the text.
They call them rivers.

00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:25.962
If you justify text, please

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.091
use hyphenation.

00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:32.867
Now, it's possible also
on the web, hyphenation. Not so,

00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:37.398
so, so good, but it's possible,
so please, if you justify text

00:39:37.422 --> 00:39:39.131
in a short column,

00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.978
please hyphenate your text.

00:39:44.958 --> 00:39:49.561
Talking about length, line length,

00:39:50.252 --> 00:39:51.252
well,

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.127
in the paragraph entitled choose
a comfortable measure,

00:39:57.151 --> 00:39:59.191
measure is the line length in typography,

00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:03.632
Robert Bringer in his famous manual,

00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:06.482
the elements of typographic style writes,

00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:12.788
"The 66-character line
is widely regarded as ideal," well,

00:40:12.812 --> 00:40:14.318
at some conditions,

00:40:14.342 --> 00:40:19.838
and, "Anything from 45
to 75 characters would do," and so on.

00:40:19.862 --> 00:40:29.569
Nevertheless,
apart from the proper numbers,

00:40:32.132 --> 00:40:37.483
we all agree that there must be a limit,
a min-max limit of the line length.

00:40:43.112 --> 00:40:46.843
Another concept here,
the perfect paragraph readability.

00:40:49.352 --> 00:40:53.768
When we talk about paragraph length,
paragraph width,

00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:56.251
we have to put that variable

00:40:57.331 --> 00:41:01.208
in relation with character size
and line height,

00:41:01.232 --> 00:41:06.458
always, because if you adjust one,
you have to adjust the other two,

00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:07.482
always.

00:41:08.279 --> 00:41:17.677
That's well said by two designers

00:41:17.701 --> 00:41:19.447
that I'd like to quote.

00:41:19.471 --> 00:41:22.092
One is Matej Latin with his metaphor

00:41:22.116 --> 00:41:27.467
of the equilateral triangle
of perfect paragraphs.

00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:33.847
The other one is Richard Rutter
with his metaphor of a three-legged stool

00:41:33.871 --> 00:41:35.187
for readability.

00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:38.552
They have the same three variables
I mentioned before,

00:41:39.512 --> 00:41:43.207
and you have to balance
the three variables in order to reach

00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:46.368
the perfect paragraph readability.

00:41:47.581 --> 00:41:49.532
Very interesting.

00:41:50.522 --> 00:41:51.883
Try it.

00:41:53.695 --> 00:41:54.991
Then fonts,

00:41:55.891 --> 00:41:58.463
how to choose them, how to use them?

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.521
Well, technology

00:42:03.571 --> 00:42:05.790
is mature for proper typography.

00:42:08.732 --> 00:42:10.028
We have better screens,

00:42:10.052 --> 00:42:14.107
better font rendering,
advanced technologies like variable fonts,

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:19.772
OpenType, amazing new CSS properties
already well supported by browsers,

00:42:21.271 --> 00:42:22.344
and more.

00:42:24.362 --> 00:42:26.800
We are ready for proper typography.

00:42:26.824 --> 00:42:29.437
How to choose the fonts?

00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:33.751
Well, please study
the technical characteristics of each,

00:42:34.412 --> 00:42:36.601
choose them based on their function,

00:42:37.951 --> 00:42:41.407
choose fonts that match
the message, of course,

00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:45.398
and test them in the context,
in the language you're using.

00:42:45.422 --> 00:42:48.307
Perhaps consider the variable ones.

00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:53.798
They are
a very new and impressive technology.

00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:59.911
I'll give you just two lines
for my favorite axes.

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:04.238
If you find a variable font
with a great axis,

00:43:04.262 --> 00:43:09.578
take it, because it's very useful
in web design.

00:43:09.602 --> 00:43:18.645
It gives small weight
without reflow, very useful for hover

00:43:20.461 --> 00:43:26.312
or for dark mode, for very,

00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:35.362
very slight optic corrections.

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.228
On the other hand,

00:43:38.252 --> 00:43:44.432
you can use optical size axis
in a font that's magic.

00:43:45.872 --> 00:43:49.298
It means that it has
different shapes of letters according

00:43:49.322 --> 00:43:51.577
to the intended font size.

00:43:51.601 --> 00:43:57.548
That's pure magic brought to you
and to your project by the type designer.

00:43:57.572 --> 00:43:59.228
Inside the font file,

00:43:59.252 --> 00:44:05.318
magic, magic, magic,
and that will help us bring

00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:09.242
back to the traditional typography.

00:44:10.171 --> 00:44:12.777
Digital typography
will finally be able to shine again,

00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:15.242
as in the old times of print,

00:44:16.232 --> 00:44:17.978
of movable type,

00:44:18.002 --> 00:44:20.887
when character shapes were perfectly crafted

00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:25.981
for the intended size usage,
and that will make a lot of difference.

00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:30.662
Enjoy your typesetting, and thank you.

00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:34.717
Please keep in touch

00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:40.597
and let me find you somewhere on the web,
both on my personal website or at

00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:42.518
one of my agencies,

00:44:42.542 --> 00:44:44.205
or on LinkedIn, maybe.

00:44:45.572 --> 00:44:46.985
Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.499
Jessica Sams: Hi.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.939
I'm your emcee, Jessica.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.839
Giulia, I invite you
to enable your camera

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.886
and we can go over some question
and answer session.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.659
There you are.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.899
Giulia Laco: Hello.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.883
Jessica: I can hear you.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.219
All right, Giulia.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.379
Wonderful presentation.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.439
I really want to congratulate
you on putting together

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:20.860
such a comprehensive review
over readability and legibility.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.564
Your audience wants to know.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.329
I believe your audience
is looking for clarity

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.299
on something that you said
early in the presentation.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.600
You said don't use fixed units for fonts.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.219
Do you have a preference

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.870
for the relative unit that is best to use?

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:50.043
Giulia: What is better not to use
is pixels or fixed units

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:56.019
because people

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.110
can't rewrite as they like.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:06.280
I've shown two ways
to zoom the text on the web.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.899
There are at least two.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.320
One is by doing a zoom

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.000
like when you hit
control-plus or command-plus,

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.019
then you have something.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.319
It's a real zoom.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.220
Whereas if you,

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.139
a user which would like
to have to read

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.100
in a bigger font,

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.262
generally enables it on the browser,
so on the preferences,

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.950
and if you test your site

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:45.040
with that different kind of sizes
in the preferences,

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.919
you'll end up discovering

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.320
that if you're using font
fixed units, either pixels,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.060
points, or any fixed unit,

00:47:01.373 --> 00:47:04.273
the user won't be able to resize it.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.290
That's why you don't have to use it.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.379
Just don't touch it.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.702
It's upon the device you use it.

00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:13.700
Then you take for granted

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.140
what the body text
is meant in that device.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:21.460
Then you use REM
or whatever you like.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.789
Jessica: I've seen mention

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:29.290
of about three-type
fonts in the chat and Q&amp;A.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.619
People are asking about your opinion

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.019
on OpenDyslexic for dyslexia.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:41.260
Also, Comic Sans as it relates
to dyslexia, and then script fonts

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.629
in the wedding industry
and such like that.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.696
Could you please comment?

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.579
Giulia: OpenDyslexia

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.299
or Comic Sans or the fonts
that are said

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.950
to be special
for people with dyslexia,

00:47:59.414 --> 00:48:02.590
they're not scientific
evidence of that,

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:09.190
especially because it's said
that dyslexia is not so much

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.219
about the typeface you're reading,

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.559
but it's about
the sound you're hearing

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.050
and the way you connect what you see
and what you hear in your mind.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:27.400
The research has to be broader
on that respect.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.830
It might be that some people
are acquainted,

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:39.160
they read a lot in that typeface,
so they are proficient.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.129
We read best what we read most.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.379
That might be useful for some people

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.474
using one of those fonts, special fonts.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.300
I, of course, recommend them
for users, not for designers.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.330
You have to put your typeface

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.750
that represents
your brand on the website

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.529
and your user will choose
for long-form reading

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:09.430
to overwrite it
if they read it better.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.459
I believe so.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.059
Jessica: Thank you.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.409
I am at times.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.410
Hi, Joe.

00:49:15.944 --> 00:49:20.109
I'm sorry I could not get
to everybody's questions in the Q&amp;A.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:24.220
Please reach out to Giulia
on her social media.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.899
Did you have something to say, Joe?

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.959
Joe Dolson: No. I was just
letting you know that you're at time

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.896
and we have to sign
off expeditiously.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.949
Jessica: Well then, I will leave
you with our closing script.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.379
Thanks for attending
the session with Giulia Laco.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.554
You can continue
the conversation in chat

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.979
or over on social media using

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.979
hashtags, #wpa11yday

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.075
and #wpad2025.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.249
We'd appreciate it if you go

00:49:54.250 --> 00:50:01.149
to 2025.wpaccessibility.day/feedback

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.946
to provide anonymous feedback

00:50:02.947 --> 00:50:05.859
for our speakers
on their presentation.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.829
You can enter to win
a T-shirt while you're there.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.529
