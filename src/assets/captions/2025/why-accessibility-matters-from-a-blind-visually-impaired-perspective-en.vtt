>> MADELEINE INTI: Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2025.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.045
My name is Madeleine Inti,

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.942
and I'm the Acting Secretary
with Google Developer Group Sucre.

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:45.393
Thank you for joining us
for Why Accessibility Matters

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.795
from a Blind
or Visually Impaired Perspective

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:50.165
with James Warnken.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.905
James Warnken is a legally blind

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:57.194
or visually impaired digital
accessibility expert and consultant,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.582
passionate about helping organizations
achieve their digital accessibility goals.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:07.140
James's background in digital marketing,
technology, and business,

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:11.936
combined with his 18-plus years
of lived experience with a disability

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:17.294
to help make achieving accessibility goals
both actionable and affordable.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:19.789
When organizations are accessible,

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:22.026
this ensures everyone,

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:24.029
employees and customers,

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:27.017
have the same opportunities
and experiences,

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.008
no matter their abilities.

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:30.212
To date,

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:33.056
James has trained
hundreds of professionals,

00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:35.159
varying from developers,

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.641
designers, teachers,
quality assurance,

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:41.248
UX, UI, marketing,

00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:44.478
to executive leadership
and human resources

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.815
on digital accessibility importance
and best practices.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:53.269
Please feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&A section,

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:56.001

>> JAMES WARNKEN: Hello, and welcome
to Why Accessibility Matters:

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.316
From a Blind
or Visually Impaired Perspective.

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:06.495
For today's conversation,

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:09.801
we're going to dive in and take a look
at some of the accessibility guidelines

00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.208
that play a part in creating
and enhancing the experience

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:18.011
for users with visual disabilities.

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:21.892
My name is James Warnken.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.417
I am your host
for this part of the conversation.

00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:31.476
A little bit about me before
we dive into the discussion for today.

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:37.151
I have been a CPACC-certified professional
for the last four years at this point

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:40.099
and been working
as a digital accessibility consultant,

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:43.062
primarily focused
on education and training,

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.915
helping other professionals
level up their skills

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:47.779
to be able to design and develop,

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:51.602
and ultimately create and maintain
accessible experiences.

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:53.677
Before working in the accessibility field,

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:56.538
I earned my bachelor's degree
in business marketing

00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:59.598
and spent quite a few years
working in the technology,

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:02.168
the marketing,
and the cybersecurity field

00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:05.758
before transitioning
into the accessibility space.

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:07.874
I'm happy and proud to share

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:10.034
that I've trained hundreds
of professionals

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:14.463
over the last couple of years
on digital accessibility best practices,

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:19.827
training on different topics
like ARIA, WCAG, accessibility law,

00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:23.976
automated accessibility testing,
so on and so forth.

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:26.736
Super excited,
super honored to be here

00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:30.613
to talk about accessibility
with all of you today.

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:33.141
Let's jump in
and take a look at our agenda

00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.540
for the next 40 or so minutes.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.545
We're going to start by understanding

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:42.147
the blind or visual disability spectrum
a little bit better.

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:44.946
We'll then take a look at some
of the common misconceptions

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:48.054
around visual impairments
and visual disabilities

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.175
before moving on and taking a look at

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.265
some of the different
assistive technology

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.277
that our blind
and visually impaired users,

00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:57.888
customers, or employees
might be using.

00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.142
We'll then move into the second half
of today's conversation

00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:04.698
by taking a look at some
of the WCAG success criteria

00:05:04.718 --> 00:05:09.332
that apply, that impact that experience
for blind and visually impaired users,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.160
before actually taking a look
at some of those barriers,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.086
talking through how we can design

00:05:15.118 --> 00:05:18.107
to prevent those barriers
from happening in the first place.

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:19.642
Then we'll round out by talking about

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:23.128
how each of our roles can play
a part in a more accessible future

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:26.241
before we wind things down
and open it up for Q&A.

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:30.201
With that said,
let's jump in and talk a little bit

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:33.259
about visual disabilities
from a high level

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.560
before we jump
into the technical stuff.

00:05:36.807 --> 00:05:38.860
When we talk about visual disabilities,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.050
many of us think of the two extremes
of the visual spectrum,

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.491
20/20 vision or totally blind.

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:49.536
When I tell people that I'm legally blind,
many of them just assume

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:51.278
that I can't see anything.

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.355
Even though I don't use a cane,
I don't use a guide dog,

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.596
I am not wearing sunglasses,

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.223
I don't fit the normal stereotype

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.667
for what a blind person
or individual might look like.

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.342
I've experienced a lot of people
asking me questions about

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:13.638
what I can and can't see,
what legally blind or low vision,

00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:15.278
what those differences are.

00:06:16.103 --> 00:06:18.468
When we talk about visual disabilities

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:21.479
and accessibility for people
with visual disabilities,

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.801
we need to consider that
full spectrum of vision,

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:28.156
whether that be low vision,
that be legal blindness,

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:30.971
that be totally blind,
that be color blindness.

00:06:31.014 --> 00:06:35.311
We need to make sure that
we're considering all of those different

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.797
sort of increments
within that spectrum, if you will.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.805
On the right-hand side of the slide here,
I have your standard visual chart.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:47.646
Just for perspective,
whenever I go to the eye doctor,

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.923
the large letter E is the only one
that I can see on that chart.

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:54.595
I can't read any of those below it,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.134
which puts me technically
at that threshold of legally blind.

00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:02.783
This chart, I think,
does a really good job

00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:05.604
of illustrating the visual spectrum.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.481
On the far left,
we have your standard 20-20 vision,

00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:13.200
and on the far right,
we have total blindness.

00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:18.252
As we move from left to right,
we can see the black dots

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:19.944
on this spectrum

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.341
increasing in frequency
and increasing in size,

00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:26.637
meaning that
there's less and less negative space,

00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:30.339
which to me means
that there's less and less vision.

00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:34.280
When I say that I'm legally blind,
I am further to the right

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.190
than I am to the left on this scale,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.755
meaning that I have less than
I believe it's 200/20 vision,

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:47.071
which is the threshold
for legal blindness.

00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:50.622
When we talk about

00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:53.502
the blind experience
and low vision users

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:57.565
and that whole spectrum
of visual disabilities,

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:00.668
there's a lot of misconceptions
around disabilities,

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:05.020
especially people with visual impairments,
because it's hard to understand them

00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.377
unless you have one.

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:08.450
Some of the misconceptions

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.344
that I have personally experienced
are people that assume that

00:08:13.364 --> 00:08:16.369
only blind people use software
like screen readers

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.354
and only low vision
people use magnification.

00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:22.254
I have met people
with cognitive disabilities

00:08:22.274 --> 00:08:26.217
and with other forms of disabilities,
and even individuals without disabilities

00:08:26.237 --> 00:08:28.790
that use screen readers
and that use magnification

00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.610
because it just makes
their experience easier,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.596
or it's just what they prefer.

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:36.712
We also see misconceptions like that

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:40.332
what works for one blind person
works for all blind people.

00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:42.644
Now that we've talked
about that spectrum,

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:45.088
that's far from the truth.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:49.803
All of us are unique individuals
with our own set of personal preferences,

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:54.196
and a one-size-fits-all mentality
really is not the way

00:08:54.216 --> 00:08:56.657
that we should be thinking
about accessibility.

00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:00.952
I've also experienced people that assume
that people with visual impairments

00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:03.408
just can't do anything
independently on their own

00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:06.693
and that they always need assistance
from other people.

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.664
Personally, the only thing
I can't do is drive a car.

00:09:10.136 --> 00:09:12.292
You could put me in pretty much
any other situation,

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:14.925
and I would figure it out
pretty much independently,

00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:18.447
if not with very minimal assistance.

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:23.285
A lot of these misconceptions
are just things that we've heard

00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:26.845
or that we assume about
a person with a disability,

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.766
especially the main one is that

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.908
blind people
aren't visiting my website.

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:33.528
They're not downloading my app.

00:09:33.548 --> 00:09:38.372
They're not reading my documents
or engaging with me on social media.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.230
My question to that is,
how do you know that?

00:09:43.086 --> 00:09:44.316
In our analytics,

00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:49.273
it doesn't tell us that 70 blind people
using screen readers were on your website,

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:53.423
so there's really no way for us
to know what magnification level,

00:09:53.443 --> 00:09:56.231
what screen reader
somebody might have been using.

00:09:56.584 --> 00:10:01.314
We need to just be mindful of that
as we're designing those experiences,

00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:04.774
especially not letting
these misconceptions

00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:06.510
drive our decision-making.

00:10:08.739 --> 00:10:11.590
When we talk about blind
and visually impaired users,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.516
assistive technology is
an important part of that conversation.

00:10:15.585 --> 00:10:18.050
That could be
a single assistive technology

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.127
being used at a single time
or for a certain activity or circumstance,

00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:25.171
or it could be a combination
of multiple assistive technologies

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:26.676
being used at once.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.607
As a person with a visual impairment,

00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:32.361
I've been losing my vision
for the last 19 years,

00:10:32.523 --> 00:10:36.891
which means that as my vision gets worse,
what adaptive strategies,

00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.594
what assistive technologies
work for me changes over time.

00:10:40.622 --> 00:10:41.931
I'm at a point in my life

00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:44.817
where I'll use magnification
most of the time,

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:49.110
whether it be on my smartphone,
an iPad, my desktop computer,

00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:50.691
but if I'm reading something

00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:54.272
that's a little bit longer in length
or my eyes are fatigued,

00:10:54.293 --> 00:10:57.630
they're tapped out for the day,
I will turn on a screen reader.

00:10:57.662 --> 00:11:01.339
As you can see from my slides,
my background is dark, my text is light.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.796
I prefer the high contrast modes
or the dark modes

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:06.343
when those are available.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.223
Assistive technology is just like
any other technology

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:15.059
in the sense that we can turn it off
and turn it on at our leisure.

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:17.916
We can customize
and configure it to fit our needs

00:11:17.936 --> 00:11:20.743
within a certain setting
or a certain activity.

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:23.541
In my case,
working in the technology field,

00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:26.136
I've had to develop my own

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:31.079
in some cases to be able to override
poor color contrast on a website

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:33.800
so that I could even read
to engage with that.

00:11:34.504 --> 00:11:36.703
From a blind
and visually impaired perspective,

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:39.934
we're talking about assistive technology
like screen readers,

00:11:39.997 --> 00:11:45.484
including the likes of NVDA, JAWS,
Narrator, VoiceOver, TalkBack.

00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:48.107
Depending on
which operating system you're on,

00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:51.500
there's a certain screen reader
that is built into your device

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.627
that any of us have free,
easy access to.

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:56.934
We're talking about
magnification software,

00:11:56.954 --> 00:12:01.619
whether that be at the operating system
or the browser, or a software level,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.407
magnifying just the tab

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:06.290
or magnifying our entire screen
all of the time.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.525
There's different ways to magnify.

00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:11.430
We're talking about
high contrast and dark modes,

00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:15.389
changing the colors to make them
more distinguishable, easier to read.

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.992
We're talking about
refreshable Braille displays

00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:22.140
that instead of converting the content
that we're seeing on the screen to audio

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.575
like a screen reader would,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.169
it's converting it to refreshable Braille
on a physical device.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.070
The options for assistive technology
within just the blind

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.776
and visually impaired community
are pretty vast.

00:12:36.796 --> 00:12:38.999
There's a lot of different options
out there

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:42.191
not to overwhelm us
as designers and developers,

00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:46.065
but to encourage us that
the technology is continuing to develop

00:12:46.085 --> 00:12:48.168
even within the assistive space

00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:50.598
to make that experience
more seamless,

00:12:50.618 --> 00:12:55.934
to make it more of the same
experience regardless of the user,

00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:58.638
their abilities, or their technology.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.373
This is where the fun really begins.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.446
When we talk about
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,

00:13:06.466 --> 00:13:09.469
the principles, the guidelines,
the success criteria,

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:12.411
whether you're looking at
AA, AA, AAA,

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:15.981
there are a subset of
success criteria in there

00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:21.132
just like for any disability category
that apply and impact that experience.

00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:23.423
When we talk about visual disabilities,

00:13:23.443 --> 00:13:26.727
we're talking about blind users
using those screen readers.

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:28.346
We're talking about low vision users

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:31.032
using magnification
or high contrast modes.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.193
We have kind of a mix here
of success criteria

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:37.292
that apply and that ultimately
impact that experience.

00:13:37.393 --> 00:13:40.561
From a blind perspective,
from a screen reader perspective,

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.540
we get success criteria
like non-text content,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.673
like info and relationships,
audio descriptions.

00:13:47.312 --> 00:13:48.989
We also need to consider that

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:51.836
most screen reader users
are not using a mouse,

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:54.987
so anything that would apply to
a keyboard user

00:13:55.007 --> 00:13:58.521
would also apply here like keyboard,
no keyboard trap,

00:13:58.894 --> 00:14:00.207
character key shortcuts.

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:03.592
Many screen readers
have character key shortcuts

00:14:03.612 --> 00:14:07.200
to navigate by heading,
or by graphics, or by landmarks.

00:14:07.332 --> 00:14:11.181
When we implement shortcuts,
we could be creating conflicts.

00:14:11.423 --> 00:14:14.873
We also see things like
error identification within forms

00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:17.100
and interactive experiences,

00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:19.903
as well as status messages,
name, role, value

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.872
that communicate to the user

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.056
what it is, what it does,
what state or value it holds,

00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:26.899
and when anything changes.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.663
From a low vision
and a color contrast perspective,

00:14:29.683 --> 00:14:32.522
we see things like resized text, reflow,

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:35.036
contrast minimum, non-text contrast,

00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.513
use of color,
sensory characteristics.

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:41.332
All of these play together
to create a visual experience

00:14:41.352 --> 00:14:42.901
that's easy to distinguish

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.325
even when you're somebody
with low vision or color blindness.

00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:52.325
There's a large list of
success criteria here that do apply,

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:55.563
that can make or break
that experience for those users,

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:58.330
regardless of
which screen reader they're using,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.374
regardless of
which level of magnification

00:15:01.394 --> 00:15:04.682
they have enabled
and set to at that specific time.

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:09.358
These success criteria help
guide us to designing experiences

00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:12.587
without those barriers being present
in the first place

00:15:12.607 --> 00:15:16.633
or removing them
if it's an experience that's pre-existing.

00:15:16.653 --> 00:15:19.670
Now let's dive in
and spend a bit of time

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.842
looking at some of
the common accessibility barriers

00:15:22.862 --> 00:15:26.029
different users
with visual disabilities might face,

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:30.473
including our screen readers,
our magnification, our braille displays,

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:33.638
and all of those different
assistive technology.

00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:36.721
Let's start off the conversation
with the one that

00:15:36.742 --> 00:15:40.432
probably impacts me the most
on a very frequent basis,

00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:43.043
and that is poor
magnification behavior.

00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:49.600
Now, when we think about magnification,
that could be 200%, 250%, 300%, 400%.

00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:54.982
The success criteria really only sets
those standards at 200% and 400%,

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:56.797
but generally speaking,

00:15:56.843 --> 00:16:00.949
when we're talking about magnification
within a browser on a website,

00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:03.521
we're thinking about responsive design.

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:08.563
We're thinking about
if I'm viewing this on a desktop at 400%,

00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:12.336
it's essentially the same thing as
what our mobile layout will look like.

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:15.390
If our mobile layouts are a mess
and they're all over the place,

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.351
chances are users on a desktop
that are magnifying

00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:20.899
are going to share
that same poor experience.

00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:23.811
When we're talking
about magnification,

00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:26.931
we're looking at the content
fitting on the page,

00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:29.118
not spilling off of the side

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:31.158
and creating two dimensions
of scrolling.

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.188
We're looking for readability,

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:36.647
the text not overlapping itself
or other elements on the page.

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:39.119
We're looking for functionality,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.919
things disappearing
when you reach certain levels,

00:16:41.976 --> 00:16:44.839
because we've created
two different experiences

00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:47.161
on the mobile and the desktop version.

00:16:47.365 --> 00:16:51.399
We want to make sure that
all of that persists and remains

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.699
at all of those different increments
of magnification.

00:16:55.317 --> 00:16:57.712
I have tested this personally,

00:16:57.732 --> 00:16:59.572
and as I come across articles

00:16:59.592 --> 00:17:03.536
that don't respond
or resize or reflow properly,

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:05.578
if it says it's a three-minute read,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.234
when I use my preferred level
of magnification,

00:17:08.254 --> 00:17:12.173
that actually turns into
closer to a 15-minute read,

00:17:12.237 --> 00:17:15.590
almost five times the amount of time
to read that article

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.942
because I'm doing so much tracking
on both the x and the y-axis

00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:24.174
because it's not contained
to fit the size of my screen.

00:17:24.628 --> 00:17:27.856
When we talk about that user experience
and what matters,

00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:28.915
we want to make sure that

00:17:28.936 --> 00:17:31.408
if it's three minutes
for the average user,

00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:34.310
that it's not much longer, if any,

00:17:34.404 --> 00:17:37.980
for users that are using tools
like magnification.

00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:42.016
Secondly, we get to color contrast.

00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:45.525
This is a very common part
of the accessibility conversation.

00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:50.451
Many of us have probably heard
of some conversation about color contrast

00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:53.074
at some point in our journeys.

00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:55.367
When we talk about color contrast

00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:57.978
from a low vision
or a colorblind perspective,

00:17:57.998 --> 00:17:59.703
we're talking about perception.

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:03.226
Can I actually see the content,
whether it's a heading,

00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:06.344
whether it's a paragraph,
and meeting those minimum threshold,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.075
or it's an interactive component
like a checkbox

00:18:09.095 --> 00:18:13.065
to agree to the terms and service
at the end of a checkout process?

00:18:13.247 --> 00:18:15.201
We want to make sure that all of those,

00:18:15.222 --> 00:18:18.655
regardless of whether
they're interactive or not interactive,

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:20.866
they're active or inactive,

00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:23.792
going a little bit against
what the guidelines say,

00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:26.599
that we can see them,
that we know what they are

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:28.352
and that we can distinguish them

00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:31.457
against the background
or the adjacent content.

00:18:31.586 --> 00:18:35.313
Going back to the gray checkbox
to agree to the terms and service,

00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:39.094
if I had a dollar for every time
that I missed that checkbox

00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:41.700
because it's light gray
on a white background,

00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:44.428
I wouldn't need to do anything
for the rest of my life.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.908
I would probably be pretty well off
because that is a very common practice

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.038
within design

00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:54.741
to hide it down there at the bottom
for some reason.

00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:57.915
If it was maybe just
a slightly darker gray

00:18:57.935 --> 00:19:00.291
or even black text
on a white background,

00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:01.886
that would be perfect.

00:19:02.157 --> 00:19:05.504
This extends to our links, our buttons,
our form fields,

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:08.547
our controls,
all of those interactive components,

00:19:08.577 --> 00:19:11.196
as well as our plain text content.

00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:17.291
Next, we get to messages and alerts.

00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:19.951
Now, from a visual perspective,

00:19:20.006 --> 00:19:22.518
we see all of this happening
on the screen.

00:19:22.538 --> 00:19:26.804
We see when we hit enter
on a search that it's loading

00:19:26.824 --> 00:19:28.972
and that things
are populating the page.

00:19:28.992 --> 00:19:31.908
We see that when we click
the add to cart button

00:19:31.955 --> 00:19:34.801
that there's now a one
above the cart icon

00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:36.491
in the top right of our screen.

00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:38.181
We can see the notifications.

00:19:38.201 --> 00:19:42.247
We can watch things load
and go through a progress bar.

00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:47.174
From a non-visual perspective,
we need to be passing those updates

00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:50.842
and those messages
along to our non-visual users

00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:53.946
using things like screen readers
or braille displays.

00:19:54.085 --> 00:19:56.085
When something is going

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:58.792
through a search process
and fetching results,

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:01.535
when a form contains conditional logic

00:20:01.646 --> 00:20:04.900
and new fields appear
based on previous inputs,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.035
we can see that,
and we also need to provide that

00:20:08.155 --> 00:20:11.451
through an audio alert
to our non-visual users

00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:13.817
so that they're not surprised

00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:17.389
or caught off guard or confused
or sitting there wondering

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:19.635
if it actually worked or if it's broken

00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:22.845
without going and exploring
the content for themselves.

00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:25.394
When we submit a form
and the form disappears,

00:20:25.414 --> 00:20:27.876
and it says thank you,
we'll be in touch soon,

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:29.437
we can see that visually.

00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:33.512
We need to make sure that
that's passed to the screen reader,

00:20:33.536 --> 00:20:35.744
to the assistive technology users,

00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:39.010
so that they know that
the form was successfully submitted.

00:20:39.518 --> 00:20:45.561
It's a fairly easy concept,
but it's very difficult

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:50.122
for a lot of people to understand
where to implement them.

00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:53.336
Generally speaking,
if we can see it on the screen

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:56.712
as a change is happening or occurring,

00:20:56.732 --> 00:20:59.666
that should be our cue or our indicator

00:20:59.787 --> 00:21:03.298
to push along those audio messages
and alerts,

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:08.739
in most cases, using something
like ARIA and alerts within that.

00:21:12.536 --> 00:21:16.129
Next, we get to elements
pretending to be other elements.

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:19.779
Now, whether you're a visual user
or a non-visual user,

00:21:19.835 --> 00:21:23.246
this can play a pretty significant part
of your experience

00:21:23.267 --> 00:21:26.916
and knowing what things are
and how to properly engage

00:21:26.936 --> 00:21:28.306
and interact with them.

00:21:28.618 --> 00:21:31.521
When we talk about
how we style our elements,

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.465
how we structure our elements,
and use attributes,

00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:38.348
all of those can be used
in either a good way,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.707
or in a misleading or confusing
or an unpredictable way.

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:45.121
Here on the slide,
I have a couple of examples.

00:21:45.145 --> 00:21:49.695
When we don't use semantic HTML
to mark and designate our headings,

00:21:49.895 --> 00:21:54.000
but instead we use CSS to make it big
and bold and look like a heading.

00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:57.426
To a visual user,
that doesn't really do anything

00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:00.101
because we're not necessarily
looking at the semantics,

00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:03.443
but to a screen reader user
navigating by headings,

00:22:03.536 --> 00:22:06.395
that text is not going to be
in that list of headings.

00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:08.987
It's going to be completely skipped
and missed over,

00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:11.209
and if it's important or essential,

00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:14.773
we just create
a very different experience

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:16.096
for those users.

00:22:16.138 --> 00:22:19.280
Similarly,
within a lot of our theme editors,

00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:21.131
our drag and drop builders now,

00:22:21.171 --> 00:22:23.081
we're seeing the terms

00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:25.577
links and buttons
used interchangeably

00:22:25.607 --> 00:22:28.120
to where we're styling our links
to look like buttons

00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:30.251
and our buttons to look like links.

00:22:30.458 --> 00:22:33.819
If I'm providing assistance
to a non-visual user

00:22:33.894 --> 00:22:37.995
and I'm telling them
to locate the next button,

00:22:38.249 --> 00:22:40.064
but there's no buttons on the page

00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:43.220
because they're semantically
marked up as links,

00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:44.900
that's a whole different experience.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.474
It makes it very difficult to provide
that assistance

00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:49.198
in some of those scenarios

00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:53.311
when we're using those words
and those styles interchangeably.

00:22:53.737 --> 00:22:57.822
The next one would be
hiding the elements,

00:22:57.842 --> 00:23:00.413
but then using CSS to bring them back.

00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:03.013
This could interfere
with assistive technology

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.070
if we're hiding the default view
of our checkboxes

00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:10.406
and implementing CSS styles
to override and overlay

00:23:10.427 --> 00:23:12.986
on top of where that checkbox
would actually be.

00:23:13.247 --> 00:23:16.506
That could create some separation
and experience as well.

00:23:16.602 --> 00:23:20.516
Then lastly, this one gets me
all of the time,

00:23:20.563 --> 00:23:23.434
is when we have cards
or entire sections

00:23:23.454 --> 00:23:25.564
that are linked out to content.

00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:28.907
In one scenario, it's a link,
and in the next, it's not.

00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:31.398
Those are scenarios where we start

00:23:31.418 --> 00:23:35.296
to mix visual components
and semantic components.

00:23:35.316 --> 00:23:37.278
This is an image that's also a link.

00:23:37.298 --> 00:23:39.774
This is a heading that's also a link.

00:23:39.837 --> 00:23:43.131
That adds to the complexity
of our experiences,

00:23:43.164 --> 00:23:47.478
making it a little bit less predictable
from a low vision perspective

00:23:47.498 --> 00:23:50.640
on which ones I can click on
and which ones I cannot,

00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:54.743
but also from a screen reader perspective
navigating using hotkeys,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.679
you might be a little bit thrown off
or confused

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.546
that there was two cards
that you could tab to,

00:24:00.688 --> 00:24:02.755
but you missed the entire third one

00:24:02.846 --> 00:24:05.680
simply because
it wasn't linked to anything.

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:08.031
We want to make sure
that we're using our styles

00:24:08.051 --> 00:24:10.117
and our structures and our attributes

00:24:10.138 --> 00:24:12.163
in the way that
they're intended to be used,

00:24:12.241 --> 00:24:15.134
so that we're creating
that single experience,

00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:17.509
whether you're visual or non-visual.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.035
Next, let's talk about headings.

00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:24.948
Technically,
there's no requirement that says

00:24:24.968 --> 00:24:27.998
that we need to use headings
within our content.

00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:30.050
However, headings are the way

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.538
that we organize and group
and section off our content.

00:24:34.228 --> 00:24:36.846
I always recommend people
to use your headings

00:24:36.897 --> 00:24:38.644
and to use them effectively.

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:40.790
Generally, we want
our heading level one

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.635
to be describing the topic

00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:44.908
or the purpose of our page as a whole.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.836
We want the heading level twos to be
the major sections within that page,

00:24:49.887 --> 00:24:52.257
and then any subsections
we could drill down

00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:54.792
to a heading level three,
a four, a five,

00:24:54.812 --> 00:24:56.435
all the way to a heading level six

00:24:56.459 --> 00:25:01.009
to designate the breadth or the scope

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:04.450
or the magnitude
of that section of content.

00:25:04.801 --> 00:25:07.038
What this does
from a visual perspective,

00:25:07.058 --> 00:25:11.776
when our headings are styled
to ascend and get smaller,

00:25:11.796 --> 00:25:14.211
the lower the heading level is,

00:25:14.231 --> 00:25:15.765
that makes it very easy

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:19.269
for us to visually organize
and separate the content.

00:25:19.498 --> 00:25:23.459
From a non-visual perspective,
when we're navigating by headings,

00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:28.267
we get to hear, welcome to our website,
heading level one.

00:25:28.317 --> 00:25:30.612
This is a new section,
heading level two.

00:25:30.688 --> 00:25:34.848
We hear the different heading levels,
which from a non-visual perspective,

00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:39.341
allows us to mental map and group
and organize the content ourselves

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:41.215
as we're navigating through it.

00:25:41.637 --> 00:25:43.941
If we're skipping
from a heading level two

00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:46.583
to a heading level five
or heading level six,

00:25:46.615 --> 00:25:48.681
that can be very disorienting.

00:25:48.701 --> 00:25:50.586
That can be a little bit confusing

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.333
because where's all the content
in between those?

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:57.424
We're used to hearing them ascend
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:25:57.746 --> 00:26:01.609
If it starts skipping
from three to five or two to six,

00:26:01.744 --> 00:26:05.046
we feel we might be missing content.

00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:06.475
Now, that's not to say that

00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:08.667
when we're starting
a whole new section,

00:26:08.687 --> 00:26:10.910
we can't jump
from a heading level four

00:26:10.931 --> 00:26:14.789
back up to a heading level two
or back up to a heading level three,

00:26:14.887 --> 00:26:16.729
because we absolutely can,

00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:19.571
because again,
we're sectioning off our content,

00:26:19.656 --> 00:26:22.940
but as we're ascending down
into those drill downs,

00:26:22.984 --> 00:26:25.629
we should not be skipping
heading levels ever.

00:26:25.996 --> 00:26:27.430
That is going to create

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.886
a very easy-to-understand
and easy-to-organize experience,

00:26:31.906 --> 00:26:34.653
both visually and non-visually.

00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:42.635
Then we also have to address
labels and instructions.

00:26:42.762 --> 00:26:44.872
When we talk about providing labels

00:26:44.892 --> 00:26:48.012
and instructions
within our embedded content,

00:26:48.032 --> 00:26:52.582
on our contact forms,
on our custom widgets and components,

00:26:52.602 --> 00:26:54.046
and experiences,

00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.181
the more information we can provide,

00:26:56.201 --> 00:26:57.167
the better.

00:26:57.187 --> 00:27:01.467
Now, I know it doesn't always feel
like it does anything,

00:27:01.487 --> 00:27:03.292
or it may not feel significant

00:27:03.312 --> 00:27:08.280
to put instructions or to put examples
alongside of your content.

00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.134
It may not be the best thing.

00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:12.956
You may not make your designers happy

00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:15.861
by wanting to put
all of this information

00:27:15.881 --> 00:27:17.237
on the page next to it

00:27:17.324 --> 00:27:19.940
or linked
from a separate destination,

00:27:20.497 --> 00:27:22.697
but ultimately,
when we provide those labels

00:27:22.837 --> 00:27:26.635
and those instructions
on what information we're asking,

00:27:26.655 --> 00:27:31.840
how to interact and how to engage
with the content effectively,

00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:36.745
ultimately, what are the outcomes
that we're setting in those experiences

00:27:36.765 --> 00:27:40.432
and predictable expectations
for our users,

00:27:40.477 --> 00:27:42.723
the more of that information
we can provide,

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.096
the less confusion,
the less frustration,

00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:49.347
the more we can pleasantly
surprise our users

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.240
that we've considered their experience

00:27:51.342 --> 00:27:56.047
and that we realize that
when we're asking for their date of birth,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.236
there's multiple formats that
that date could be entered.

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:02.275
Or when we're asking
for certain information

00:28:02.286 --> 00:28:04.203
that requires a special format,

00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.990
that we've considered
and we're helping them to do that,

00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:09.231
and we've already provided
the instructions

00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:10.484
before we tell them

00:28:10.534 --> 00:28:14.115
that they didn't do it right
and alert them with an error message.

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:17.880
Labels and instructions are essential

00:28:18.034 --> 00:28:22.046
to that experience
and providing that predictability,

00:28:22.066 --> 00:28:23.583
that reliability,

00:28:23.603 --> 00:28:25.849
knowing that the user can confidently

00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:28.132
and effectively complete
that experience

00:28:28.153 --> 00:28:32.705
without running into any errors
or issues or making any mistakes.

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.955
We could talk about

00:28:38.348 --> 00:28:41.410
all of the success criteria
from the previous slides.

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:46.193
We could go into pretty great detail
into each one of them,

00:28:46.213 --> 00:28:49.960
explaining how each impacts
the blind or visually impaired

00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:52.610
or low vision or colorblind experience

00:28:52.683 --> 00:28:56.813
and how we can design
and create experiences around those

00:28:56.833 --> 00:29:00.962
to not present those barriers
in the future.

00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:04.222
Happy to do that,
but for the sake of time,

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.903
those that we've just covered are the ones
that we see the most common

00:29:08.923 --> 00:29:12.273
as we're conducting auditing,
as we're consulting,

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:15.283
as we're helping
with remediation strategy,

00:29:15.307 --> 00:29:17.903
educating and training
designers and developers,

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.533
and technical professionals.

00:29:19.622 --> 00:29:22.024
Those are the most common ones.

00:29:22.893 --> 00:29:25.417
As I wind down this conversation,

00:29:25.437 --> 00:29:27.120
the last piece of advice

00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:29.460
or the last thing that
I would like to share is

00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:34.701
that we all have a role to play within
creating a more accessible future,

00:29:34.721 --> 00:29:37.134
creating a space and an experience

00:29:37.203 --> 00:29:40.584
that everybody can share
regardless of their abilities,

00:29:40.604 --> 00:29:42.614
regardless of their personal
preferences,

00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:44.564
and their assistive technology.

00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:49.344
That could be our marketing teams,
our PR teams, our leadership teams,

00:29:49.364 --> 00:29:52.230
our UX/UI team, our research team.

00:29:52.351 --> 00:29:57.008
We can all play a part in creating
that accessible experience,

00:29:57.211 --> 00:29:59.181
choosing accessible brand colors,

00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:02.258
sending accessible
onboarding materials,

00:30:02.914 --> 00:30:06.546
how we engage with our employees
and our partners and our vendors,

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:07.761
and our customers,

00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:09.616
because we don't always know

00:30:09.637 --> 00:30:11.331
what somebody is going through.

00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.948
We don't know what works best for them
unless we ask

00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:18.943
and unless we actually take the time
to truly understand that experience,

00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:23.017
we're more than likely leaving things out,
we're leaving things on the table

00:30:23.097 --> 00:30:24.840
as far as opportunities

00:30:24.861 --> 00:30:29.464
to bring that person in to allow them
to engage more effectively

00:30:29.485 --> 00:30:32.990
or more fully within our organization
as a whole,

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:38.170
not just within our websites
or social media content or applications.

00:30:39.781 --> 00:30:43.700
I encourage everyone
to take this conversation

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.373
and use it as a diving board

00:30:46.393 --> 00:30:50.870
to explore and dive deeper
into specific experiences,

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.177
whether that be blind
and visually impaired,

00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:56.323
that be low vision,
that be deaf or hard of hearing,

00:30:56.343 --> 00:30:59.043
cognitive seizures,
and physical reactions.

00:30:59.177 --> 00:31:04.372
There are entire worlds within each
of these that we need to understand

00:31:04.414 --> 00:31:08.312
as we're creating and designing
experiences in the future.

00:31:08.347 --> 00:31:09.873
My name is James Warnken.

00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:12.142
Again, it has been an absolute honor

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:15.063
to participate
in WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.943
I would love to connect on LinkedIn,

00:31:17.963 --> 00:31:20.852
answer any questions
that we may not be able to get to

00:31:20.873 --> 00:31:25.201
within the Q&A portion
of our last couple of minutes here,

00:31:25.445 --> 00:31:28.523
and I'm always happy
to talk about accessibility,

00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:30.069
to dive down rabbit holes,

00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:33.307
and either find solutions
or create solutions.

00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:38.256
With that, I would like to turn it over
and open things up for questions.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.929
Madlin Nti: Thank you very much, James,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.400
for such a great presentation.

00:31:47.749 --> 00:31:52.109
This is to remind you to let
your questions flow in the Q&A,

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:55.229
and James will duly answer them.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.140
I'm going straight
to the Q&A section, James.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.379
We dive right into it.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.869
James Warnken: My camera
and microphone are on,

00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:05.100
just to confirm, correct?

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.629
Madlin: Yes. Yes, they are.

00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:08.289
James: Excellent. Madlin: Okay.

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:10.769
Tackle asked,

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:13.560
"Which of the areas you discussed,

00:32:13.649 --> 00:32:15.358
like heading level,

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:16.560
color contrast,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.749
missing labels, has the biggest effect
on how you can use or interact

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.750
with a site?"

00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:27.570
James: I would say going
back to using the structure,

00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:29.189
the semantics, the attributes,

00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:35.130
letting the user actually perceive
the content accurately to know what it is,

00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:38.579
what state or property it has,
what value it currently holds,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.649
the info and relationships,

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.840
the name, role value, the status messages.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.070
If we don't know what it is,
the experience stops right there.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.169
I would really focus on that,
and then let the styles

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:59.128
and the heading levels and all of that be
the follow-up to build out

00:32:59.129 --> 00:33:00.150
that experience.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.070
If we're using headings,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.860
that's a good step
in the right directions,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.776
using the headings appropriately
that's the next step of the conversation.

00:33:10.032 --> 00:33:11.850
Madlin: Thank you for that.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.319
Bilius Bocula is asking,
"Aside from automated

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.749
tools, how to test for color contrast
and other color or zoom-related issues

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.880
if a person is totally blind?"

00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:26.574
James: Yes. When it
comes to color contrast,

00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:29.595
the tool that I prefer is
the WebAim Contrast Checker,

00:33:29.644 --> 00:33:32.612
just because it has the color picker
and makes my life really easy

00:33:32.612 --> 00:33:34.648
when I'm testing to grab

00:33:34.649 --> 00:33:35.649
the values

00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:39.868
and have it do all the fun math for me
to calculate the ratios.

00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:42.688
When it comes to testing
things like heading levels,

00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:44.910
I use a Chrome extension
called the Headings Map.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:49.888
When it comes to things like spacing,
there's a Chrome extension for that.

00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:52.889
There's a lot of really,
really good tools out there

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.910
for simulating that experience,
for understanding that experience.

00:33:57.239 --> 00:34:01.468
The problem that we often run
into when it comes to automated tools is

00:34:01.469 --> 00:34:02.940
that they're just simulations.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.679
The best way to truly understand

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:09.989
the real user experience is to go
into your browser settings and increase

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:13.889
the magnification yourself,
to go into your operating system,

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:16.716
whether you're on Mac
and you have access to VoiceOver,

00:34:16.717 --> 00:34:20.067
or you're on Windows and you have
access to something like Narrator,

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:21.069
turn those on.

00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:22.619
You can use your mouse.

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:23.880
You can use your keyboard.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.990
Turn on the screen reader.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.730
Turn on the high contrast modes.

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.489
You might find
that you prefer to use them.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.590
That's just the way it is.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.969
A lot of accessibility settings
and features become mainstream.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.282
Captions are a really good example.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.319
I would encourage everyone

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:44.700
to use your tools as effectively
as they can be used.

00:34:45.209 --> 00:34:49.079
At a certain point, we do have
to turn on the technology.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.739
We have to experiment
and explore it for ourselves to get

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.940
the full understanding
of what that experience

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.579
actually looks like,

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.489
what it sounds like,
what it feels like when you're

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.570
an actual user.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.980
Madlin: Right.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.720
Thank you.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.821
David Denado is asking,
"What operating system

00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:08.723
and screen reader do you prefer?

00:35:08.752 --> 00:35:10.952
Is it Windows, Mac, or Linux?"

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.729
James: I am a Windows computer guy.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.490
I prefer to use Windows.

00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:19.559
I have several Windows computers.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.000
I still have one running Windows 7.

00:35:22.379 --> 00:35:25.079
I don't use Narrator, which is
the screen reader built

00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:27.479
into Windows computers.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.709
I use NVDA, which is
the free open-source screen reader option.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.169
I just find that I prefer
the settings menu and the customization

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.930
within the settings to fit me better.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.349
I generally navigate more towards NVDA,
but that's only in a desktop setting.

00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:51.358
When it comes to mobile or tablet,
I love the Apple ecosystem.

00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:53.559
When it comes to mobile
and handheld devices,

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.479
there, I'm using VoiceOver
on my iPhone or my iPad

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.720
when I'm using a mobile phone.

00:36:00.749 --> 00:36:03.268
I still prefer to sit
at a computer, though,

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:04.650
for most of my work.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.949
I have not migrated to working
from my phone quite yet.

00:36:09.352 --> 00:36:11.660
Madlin: Thank you for that.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.009
Jeff Singleton is asking,

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.249
"When reviewing a website
for accessibility,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.479
how might testing,

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.199
if any, do you conduct using
a screen magnifier?"

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.729
Could you tell him what you're looking
for when testing with a screen magnifier?

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.030
James: Shout out to you, Jeff.

00:36:29.214 --> 00:36:32.189
Sorry, I didn't make it
to the call earlier today.

00:36:33.899 --> 00:36:36.328
When it comes to testing
with magnification,

00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:40.800
because that's my primary mode
for consuming content,

00:36:41.277 --> 00:36:45.539
I am looking at everything
from readability to functionality.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.259
I'm looking to make sure
that I can still open and close

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.010
those menus. I'm making sure
that I can expand things.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:57.269
I see often a lot of dialogue menus
don't properly resize.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.958
They either stay their default size
or they're so big

00:37:00.959 --> 00:37:02.369
that they're cutting off.

00:37:02.632 --> 00:37:05.820
Webbing contrast checker
is actually a good example.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.700
When you open up the color picker,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.280
depending on your magnification,
you might not have access

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.869
to that functionality anymore.

00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:18.420
There's a lot of things that I'm looking
at and considering within that experience,

00:37:19.143 --> 00:37:24.419
and making sure that I can still read
the content at the very high level,

00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:28.710
but that I can still interact
with all of the functionality,

00:37:28.949 --> 00:37:31.859
whether it be with a mouse,
whether it be touch on a phone,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.119
or with a keyboard.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120
We see a lot,

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.139
for some reason,
that the keyboard functionality

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.433
tends to disappear or decrease

00:37:39.483 --> 00:37:43.380
when you're at something
like 400% magnification.

00:37:45.154 --> 00:37:47.444
There's a lot of things
that we're looking at.

00:37:47.504 --> 00:37:48.724
[laughs]

00:37:49.075 --> 00:37:50.256
Madlin: Honestly, yes.

00:37:51.135 --> 00:37:52.025
Thank you for that.

00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:54.090
Mark S. is asking,

00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:59.640
"Can you talk about the use of CSS Grid
and being able to reorder the content

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.269
visually versus
how it's recognized by the AT?

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.407
For example, a card
usually have a title, eyebrow,

00:38:07.457 --> 00:38:10.487
image, subtitle, description,
et cetera,

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.517
but the order to display
might not be logical per se,

00:38:13.518 --> 00:38:15.659
but the grid can help with that,"
he thinks.

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:17.409
What do you have to say about that?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.049
James: No matter what layout you're using,
for certain assistive technology

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.200
like screen readers,
it's actually going off

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.679
of the order of the DOM.

00:38:26.519 --> 00:38:29.219
That's where that different experience
comes into play.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.579
If we're using CSS to move things around,

00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:37.498
to change that visual presentation,
it's still going to be

00:38:37.499 --> 00:38:40.229
that same presentation
to assistive technology

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.280
like a screen reader.

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:45.058
What it looks like visually,
we really just need to focus

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:47.698
on our responsive design,
whether we're using grid

00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:51.238
or flex or any of those
that are available to us,

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:56.280
and making sure that as essentially
the size of the screen gets smaller,

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.358
that the content is responding
and maintaining its structure

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:04.260
and its order and its logic at all
of those different viewports.

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:06.959
A lot of times, the mobile
gets a lot of attention,

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.739
and the desktop gets a lot of attention,
but the tablet in the in-between

00:39:10.769 --> 00:39:11.769
really doesn't.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.899
I'm one of those people
that generally are magnifying somewhere

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.313
in the in-between.

00:39:17.523 --> 00:39:21.449
Things don't always look that great
because it's a weird,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.199
it's in between the breakpoints
that we've set.

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:28.049
It's still trying
to play the desktop role,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:33.358
but it can't fit everything on the screen,
or attributes like overflow aren't

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:37.345
being incorporated
at that certain viewport height and width.

00:39:37.955 --> 00:39:39.405
Madlin: Yes, I get that.

00:39:39.775 --> 00:39:43.589
Peggy is asking,

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:48.780
"How do you feel about widgets to enable
high contracts or dark mood on a website?"

00:39:50.279 --> 00:39:52.589
James: When I'm working
on WordPress sites,

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.919
the accessibility plugin,
I forget the exact name,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.379
but it puts the little controls
on the side.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.049
I have found success with those.

00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:03.868
I've also found
where they really don't work that great

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:06.749
because of the way
the themes are designed,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.568
and coded, and developed,
to where some elements

00:40:09.569 --> 00:40:12.478
will invert when you enable
high contrast mode,

00:40:12.479 --> 00:40:13.479
and others do not.

00:40:14.759 --> 00:40:19.709
I really would focus on checking
the experience top to bottom

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.336
and checking it pretty thoroughly,
whether that be your default states

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:24.340
or your hover states,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.149
whether that's what it looks like
in light mode

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:32.339
or dark mode within your dropdown menus
and making sure that everything converts,

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:37.470
not just what's on the surface,
because that's what we often see is

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.900
the background might be set to white.

00:40:40.379 --> 00:40:41.579
When we invert that,

00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:46.950
because we have an image with an overlay,
it doesn't actually look like it inverts.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.909
I would just be thorough
within your widgets,

00:40:50.939 --> 00:40:54.439
whether that be a plugin or something
that you're creating on your own,

00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:57.270
and making sure that that extends
to all of the content,

00:40:57.569 --> 00:40:59.670
not just what we can see initially.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.570
Madlin: Right.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.759
Gina Sheldrake is asking,
"What about a color contrast

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.180
that has three color checks
if you want them to work together?

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.090
There are lots on two color contrast."

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.779
James: I actually have friends

00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:19.708
that have developed tools,
and our color palette tools

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:23.009
are a great way to experiment
with this as well.

00:41:23.549 --> 00:41:26.879
The more colors we introduce,
the harder it is to meet

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.169
those minimum thresholds.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.949
If we have text that has
a gradient applied to it,

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.308
where it starts as one color
and throughout the word,

00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:37.560
it's gradients into another color

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.129
against the background,
you're just adding complexity,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.199
you're making your job harder
than it might need to be,

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.339
especially when you get
into three, four, five,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.718
or even six colors.

00:41:49.719 --> 00:41:51.489
Your options really,

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.249
really shrink the more colors
you add into the mix.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.229
I would look at your color palettes,
and I would evaluate those colors,

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.160
maybe not necessarily adjacent
to each other,

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.590
because as long as both colors
against the background are accessible,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.380
then gradient one into the other
should be accessible as well.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.808
I would try to be a little bit mindful
when you're adding multiple colors,

00:42:16.809 --> 00:42:24.398
but also be a little bit more creative
and in the approach of how to use

00:42:24.399 --> 00:42:27.998
all three of those colors in a way
that still meets those minimums,

00:42:27.999 --> 00:42:30.968
whether that be using
one as your text color,

00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:32.979
one as your background,
and one as an accent,

00:42:32.979 --> 00:42:35.440
or one as a border color or a drop shadow.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.810
There's a lot of different ways
to implement color,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:44.919
and having two solid colors and a third
as a supporting or an accent might be

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.819
a little bit better of an option
than trying to use all three of them

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.450
and force essentially
a square peg in a round hole.

00:42:52.496 --> 00:42:54.567
Madlin: Honestly, yes.

00:42:55.087 --> 00:42:58.149
Last question
before everything we wrap up,

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.599
Corey Curtis is asking,
"Do you zoom manually

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.189
or in browser settings?

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.940
Is there a difference in outcomes?"

00:43:05.446 --> 00:43:08.170
James: I tend to use both.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.640
It really depends on the device.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.660
When I'm in a browser,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.919
I'm using control plus,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920
control minus

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.519
to use the browser-level zoom.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.330
In some tools that works great,
in others it really doesn't.

00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:21.739
When I find tools
that doesn't work,

00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:25.286
I'll back up to the operating
system magnifier

00:43:25.497 --> 00:43:27.548
that can be window mode,

00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:30.849
or it can be full screen,
like I mentioned during the presentation.

00:43:32.169 --> 00:43:34.989
Those are going
to be two very different experiences.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.984
Within the browser,

00:43:35.985 --> 00:43:38.584
everything is resizing and reflowing,

00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:42.159
and we're not using
essentially assistive technology.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.810
We're using the browser features.

00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:48.399
When we add in something like Fusion
or ZoomText or the Windows magnifier,

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:52.058
that's outside of the author's control
at that point.

00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:53.680
The content isn't changing.

00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:57.219
We're basically putting
a magnifier over top of it,

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.820
like we would
with more traditional assistive technology

00:44:01.059 --> 00:44:04.779
like CCTVs or other things of that nature.

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:07.599
Madlin: Yes, thank you so much, James.

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:08.799
It was lovely having you.

00:44:08.799 --> 00:44:10.949
Thank you so much
for the presentation, too.

00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.651
James: Yes, thank you for having me.

00:44:12.651 --> 00:44:14.522
I'm honored to be here,

00:44:14.676 --> 00:44:17.860
excited to continue
the accessible conversation.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.960
If anybody has any questions
that we didn't get to,

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:25.511
I would love to connect and continue
the conversation beyond just today.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.289
Madlin: Sure. Thank you for attending
this session with James Warnken.

00:44:29.289 --> 00:44:32.608
You can continue the conversation
in the chat or on social media
